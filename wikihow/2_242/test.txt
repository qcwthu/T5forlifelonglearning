This tends to happen quickly, so turn off your car as soon as you notice it.  If the hood is too hot to touch, wait at least 10 minutes before opening it.  The hose can be very hot, so only touch it for a few seconds with your fingertips. Repeat for the bottom radiator hose.   Both radiator hoses should be very warm to the touch. If one hose is very hot and the other one feels cool or even cold to the touch, the thermostat is likely stuck in the closed position.	Look to see if your temperature gauge is nearing the danger point. Open the hood of your car as long as it is not too hot and locate the radiator hoses. Touch the top radiator hose carefully.
Anyone who has seen “The People’s Court” or “Judge Judy” has probably seen all kinds of oral agreements that get held up as contracts. However, the sale of an automobile must be in writing in order to be enforceable., If you are the seller of the car, you are the one responsible for the language in the contract. If there are any terms in the contract that wind up being ambiguous, they will usually be ruled in favor of the buyer.If you want to have the right to repossess the car in case of a default, make sure that your contract defines the following issues:   Default – just what is a “default”? Do you want the right to repossess if the buyer is a day late with his or her payment? A week late? A month late? Be sure to specify.Notice – If the buyer is late, will you issue a warning or notice of default before repossessing? In some states, you may have to, but in others you may not. Spell it out in the contract.Grace Period – Will you allow a grace period for late payments? Many contracts will accept payments that are made within, for example, five to ten days late, but many do not. This is a point you need to discuss when signing the contract and make sure to include it in writing.  In this case, the collateral is the car itself. Part of your sale contract needs to include language that creates a security interest in the car.  Your contract needs to put the buyer on notice that failure to pay on time may lead to repossession. You will need to check with your state law to be sure that you use the proper language about creating a security interest, which is what gives you the right to repossess the property., If this was a private sale to a friend or neighbor, then locating the vehicle may not be a difficult process. On the other hand, it may take some work to hunt it down. When you do believe that you have found the vehicle, be absolutely certain that you have the actual car. Check the car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). You can usually find this on the dashboard, in the front left corner under the windshield. Check and make sure that it exactly matches the number on your title or contract for the sale.  When you go to take possession of the car, you will need to have the proof that you are entitled to it. This would include the original contract, the proof of payments that you have received and, by the absence, the ones you have not received. If you need the help of a police officer or a locksmith, for example, they will most certainly require this information.  You have a few choices when it comes to gaining entry into a car and removing it from the premises.   Use the key code to have a key made in advance. Many cars manufactured within the last six years have a key code that can be found on the title or by looking up the car’s VIN. You can use this key code to have a key made for you.Pick the car lock to get in. Slide a narrow metal rod through the window and into the door, then use it to pull up the door lock. You may also use a wire coat hanger bent to the correct shape. Tow the vehicle. You may opt to hire a towing company or tow the car yourself. Start the vehicle without a key. Use this method if you must gain entry into the car without having a key. There are other sources online with information about “hot wiring” a car.  Once you have taken possession, remove the car to a secure location where you can hold it until you resolve the issue of payment or sale. Be aware that once the car is in your possession, you become responsible for its condition. If the car gets damaged through your negligence, the debtor may actually have a legal claim against you for any loss in the car's value.  Nearly every state has a law that allows you to repossess a car as described here. Those laws also require that you are not allowed to “breach the peace” to take the car.A “breach of peace” generally means that you may not:   Break into someone’s house to get the keys, or into their locked garage to take the car. (There is some question about taking the car from a closed, but unlocked garage.)Cause a fight or other physical altercation while taking the car. For example, if the owner/debtor notices what you are doing and tries to stop you, perhaps by standing in your way or blocking the car, you may not forcibly remove him in order to take the car.Cause damage to the car or other property while in the act of repossessing the car.  You may have the right to repossess the car, but that does not give you the right to any additional property that is inside the car. For example, if the owner/debtor has expensive camera equipment in the back seat, you are responsible for returning that to him or at least notifying him how and when he can collect it. Otherwise, he could turn around and sue you for the value of that additional property., To “redeem” means to pay off the amount that is owed and buy back the car. Most states allow the debtor this right., The purpose of repossessing a car is usually to re-sell it in order to collect the money that is owed on the loan. As the lender, you are required to conduct this sale in a “commercially reasonable” manner. This means that you must advertise it fairly and conduct it at a place and time that is reasonable expected to bring a fair price.You may not, for example, tell two of your friends that you will be holding an auction at 2:00 a.m. on Tuesday and consider that “commercially reasonable.” It is up to you to sell the car for a fair price.  If you repossess a car, you are generally entitled to recover not only the full unpaid loan amount but also any costs of the repossession, advertisement of a sale, costs of hiring an auctioneer, etc. You must keep accurate records of all these costs and be able to show them if the debtor questions your figures., If you are able to sell the car for an amount that is greater than the loan and the costs you incurred, you are required to return any remaining money to the debtor. You are only allowed to collect what you are actually owed – not more., If the debtor notifies you at any point in this process that he has filed bankruptcy, then your efforts to repossess the car must stop immediately.   If you have not yet taken possession of the car, then do not go through with the repossession. If you have already taken possession of the car but have not yet sold it, then you should keep it secure until you are contacted by a representative of the Bankruptcy Court with further instructions. If you have advertised a sale but have not held it yet, you should stop and check with the bankruptcy trustee to find out if you may proceed with the sale. Any action you take after being notified of a bankruptcy case could be considered a violation of federal law on your part and could create serious problems for you.	Have a valid written contract. Create clear contract language. Create a “security interest.” A “security interest” is what creates the collateral for your loan, and what gives you the right to repossess the property. Include a clear provision about repossession. Locate the vehicle. Gather your paperwork. Take possession. Remove the car. Do not create a breach of peace. Limit the repossession to the car alone. Allow the borrower the right to redeem his car. Conduct a “commercially reasonable” sale. Keep accurate records. Return excess value from sale of car. Beware of bankruptcy.
Pin the 3 by 16 inch (8 by 41 cm) strip to 1 side of the front square. Gather the fabric together and sew with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Iron the seam down so that it lays flat.  Pin a 3 by 18.5 inch (8 by 47 cm) strip to the abutting side of the front square. The 2 strips should connect at the end. Sew the strip onto the front square with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Iron down the seam so that the project lays flat on your sewing table.  Layer 2 pieces of 3 by 18 inch (8 by 47 cm) strips together to make your sashes. Place the 2 right sides of the fabric together, in order to sew the sashes inside out.  Crease 1 end of the strip diagonally at the end. Crease it firmly so that you can see the line when you sew. You will use this crease to sew a tapered sash. Sew around the perimeter of the sash. When you reach the end of each sash, sew at a diagonal along the crease, instead of sewing into the corners. Keep the opposite end of the sash open so that you can turn it inside out. Cut the extra fabric from the edges. Also, trim the extra fabric at the corner of the tapered end of the sash. Turn the sash inside out. Repeat this process with the other 3 by 18 inch (8 by 47 cm) pieces of sash fabric.  Pin the sashes to the front of the main body of your apron. Pin them on either side of the apron, just above the corners where the border strips start.  Pin the extra length of the sashes to the center of the front of your apron to keep them free of the sewing needle as you finish your project. Make sure you pin the open end of the sash to the body and leave the tapered edge free.  Place the 18.5 by 18.5 inch (47 by 47 cm) square right side down on top of the front of your apron. Smooth the fabric and pin the sides.  Sew around the perimeter of the apron. Leave a 3 inch (8 cm) section open so that you can turn your project inside out. Cut the tops of your 4 corners with fabric scissors. This will ensure you have points at the edges of your apron. Turn the apron inside out. Poke the points out with a knitting needle. Iron it flat. Sew a 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) seam around the perimeter of your apron. This will close your turning hole. Make sure your straps do not get in the way and get sewed to your project in more than 1 place.  The top is opposite the border strips., Fold the top corner down 6 inches (15 cm). Make sure it is even on both sides of the fold. Pin it in place.  Place a button right above the point of the folded down triangle. Sew it onto the apron, affixing the folded down triangle to the body of the apron. Iron the top of the fold so that it lays flatly.  Place your 2 strips of neck strap fabric right side together. Sew around the perimeter, leaving 1 end open so that you can turn it.  Iron the fabric so that it lays flat. Pin 1 end of the neck strap to the back of 1 side of the turned down triangle. Sew a small rectangle through the apron and neck strap end for an extra stable seam. Pin the other end to just below the other side of the turned down triangle. Make sure you don't twist the neck strap in the process. Sew another small rectangle through the apron and bottom edge of the neck strap.  Pin the 2 pieces of contrasting pocket fabric with the right sides together.  Sew around the perimeter of the pocket, leaving a few inches for turning. Trim the edges of each corner. Turn the pocket inside out and poke the corners straight with a knitting needle. Iron the pocket flat. Sew a 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) seam around the perimeter of the pocket. Fold 1 corner of the pocket down, just like you did at the top of your apron. Make sure it is evenly folded and pin it in place. Sew a button to the bottom tip of the triangle. Iron the fold.  Sew along the 3 edges, leaving the top folded edge open. Iron your apron a final time and begin wearing it.	Sew your borders. Make your sashes. Attach your sashes. Attach your apron backing. Lay your apron on its back with the top up. Finish the top of your apron. Attach your neck straps. Create your pocket. Pin your pocket to the right side of your apron, just below the sash strip.
Despite what you may think based on the looks of some punks, the movement isn't about fashion, so ladies, don't spend hours looking for the "perfect outfit" or putting on makeup, and guys, don't wear your "favorite shirt" or anything you don't mind getting beer and sweat on - and both of you, be prepared to have a shirt get ripped. These shows get very hot and sweaty after a while, and most of them stretch on in excess of three hours (most cities have a midnight - 2:00AM curfew though), so wear something that can breathe and not get ripped off easily. T-shirts, jeans/shorts, and good athletic shoes or boots are preferred. Tank tops, sandals, and skirts or baggy pants are not.; , Whether you're talking to a bouncer, a band member, or another person in the audience, be polite and respectful. Strike up a conversation with someone between bands; who knows, you might find out about another cool band or even make a friend!  , If one begins to form, get out if you have no idea how to maneuver your way around in one. If you feel brave, however, know that it's mainly shoving and slamming into other people (slam-dancing) or running in a circle. Depending on the genre, some people (known as "hardcore dancers") will swing their arms and kick to the rhythm of the music. In all of these cases, nobody is intentionally hurt, and if you fall or want to get out, people will help you out. If you wish to leave, make your intentions known to the people at the "wall" of the pit by making a T shape with your hands to express your wish for "time out", otherwise, you may be mistaken for a slam-dancer trying to approach the wall and will be shoved back as a result. Do not take offense if this happens; just try to leave elsewhere.  If you get hurt, it's nobody's fault but your own, since nobody forced you to do it. That being said, if you wish to crowd-surf, make sure that the people around you are cool with it, make sure your wallet, keys, and phone are someplace safe (to prevent them from being stolen) and keep your feet above people's heads. If you're a girl, you may get groped by a jerk in the audience; the people around them will usually retaliate for you, so don't go blindly kicking into where the person was. If you get dropped, try to protect your head and your back; your body can take an impact, but your brain and spine won't do that very easily. As for stage diving, don't stay onstage for more than three seconds, definitely do not touch the band members, and make sure that the audience will catch you. The bigger (height and weight wise) you are, the less likely they are to catch you. Other than that, just stick to the basics above.  If you begin to feel dizzy or faint, get out of the crowd, get some water, and get into some fresh air. If you do pass out or even begin to get weak, you could lose footing and be crushed under the rest of the crowd. This has happened before (most infamously at a concert by The Who in Cincinnati and at a Smashing Pumpkins gig in the 90's), and you don't want it to happen to you.  If water isn't free (it usually is at punk shows), conserve it as much as possible. If it's free, drink at least two glasses between bands or when you get tired, and maybe pour a little over your head to cool off if you feel hot enough.  Retaliation will get you thrown out at best or assaulted at worst, so let the big guys do their job.  Jump around like a maniac, scream until your voice goes out, go to school/work the next day with bruises and five hours of sleep, and have some good memories for the future.	Wear practical clothing and footwear. Be cool. Moshing originated in the punk movement, and it definitely still goes on to this day. Crowd surfing and stage diving are dangerous, however some people choose to do this anyway. If you can't breathe, GET OUT. Stay hydrated. Guys AND girls: If someone's harassing you (verbally, physically, or sexually), tell the bouncers. Have fun.
; , Make sure the gaps in the hoop (called Snare Gates) line up with the Snare mechanisms. Screw in the tension bolts so they don't fall out. Don't tighten too much.  The T-Nut is what your Tension Bolts screw into instead of Lugs, you can see them inside the Suspension Ring. The general idea is you're trying to get the snare side of the system pre-leveled before you put the shell in.  Here is where it gets a little tricky. Snares have a little depression in the shell called a Snare Bed. It is vital that the snares are aligned correctly with the snare bed. To find the snare bed on your shell, look for either a sticker or a shallow cut on the inside on the shell.   This snare has a small dot instead of those.  An easy way to do this is to take two opposite sided tension bolts, and screw them in just enough that the suspension ring or the top of the T-nut stops moving.  Don't tighten it too much, 2 turns should be enough., Because of the way Sleishman drums work, the bottom head won't have similar tension on all of the bolts. So go around and tighten any bolts that are very loose. Don't over tighten, you're aiming for as close to the same tension on each bolt as you can.  As Sleishman drums are under constant refining, this article won't discuss how to attach the snares to the snare mechanism. However, once again, make sure that the snare wires are sitting directly in the middle of the snare bed and in the middle of the drum. If you get it off, it will have an undesirable sound.  Because you've set up the drum already, all your tuning happens from the top head., How you tune your snares is you tighten them up and tap on the drum lightly. If it sounds like a tom, it's too tight. Start loosening it up until you can hear the snares responding to your lightest touch. Once you've done that, your snare drum is done.	Place the suspension ring batter side down. Place your Reso/Snare head and Snare Hoop on your suspension ring. Pick up the system and start screwing in the tension bolts so the bottom of the tension bolt is flush with the bottom of the T-nuts as in photo. Place your shell in your system. Take your top head and top hoop and place them on your shell like normal (see photo) and screw the tension bolts in so that all the lugs are under similar tension. Take your drum key(s) and tighten your top head. Flip the drum over and start adjusting your bottom head. Attach the snare wires. Turn off your snares and start tightening the drum from the top head only. Turn on your snare and start tuning them up.
The 1 represents the "root" (fundamental) note. The 3 represents "the 3rd," or the note 2 places up. The 5 represents "the 5th," which is 4 places up from the root and 2 places up from the 3rd. Each note skipped is called an interval (creating a pleasing separation between the ones that are sounded out).  It's easier to learn basics of harmony by hearing the notes played on a piano. Then one can start to sing along with the piano notes. Then they can move on to singing the harmony with another singer.   A good step is to distinguish 2 or 3 singers each singing the melody an octave higher or lower than the other which is just singing in unison but is not harmonizing. For example: the male lead singing the melody an octave low "versus" a female soprano are in unison (not harmony). Singing unison is "layering," and may enhance sound as in a choir (but a duet, trio or quartet is not normally unison, except for some special effect).    But, if a soloist sings a harmony note instead of the melody, that is a form of singing off key. , Bad harmony is being inconsistent, and so traveling from ones note to the note of someone else (off key).   If there are more than 3 people you can have 2 or more singing each of the notes as in a choral group. Once you have a sense of the basics of harmonizing the "1, 3, 5 and 1, 3, 5, 7" you may experiment with other kinds of notes in other chords which have sharps or flats.	Show two or more singers the harmony of the three most basic chords: "1,3,5" chords (which are just the key of C or key of F or key of G) which have no sharps, no flats, etc. Demonstrate chords to the singers and help them to hear how the different note combinations (chords) sound when working together. Harmonize by singing "to the melody" but in a slightly lower or higher pitch to create a chord with voices. Add a 7th for a fourth voice in harmony and/or the 1st (or root) note, up one octave (for unison).  , Learn the basic 1,3,5,7 major chord notes (C7, F7, G7 -- see "Tips" below), as a group, and then you can help singers harmonize by their consistently carrying one of the chord notes; after they learn to hear them in the chord (and so they hear harmony) among voices.
Prepare to do the Cup Song by setting a cup down on a table. The cup should be rim down. Give yourself some space on either side of the cup.   A plastic cup is best. Avoid using a glass or heavy cup until you have perfected the Cup Song.; , Clap your hands together directly above the cup two times. Your hands should be about six inches above the cup.If your hands are too far from the cup, it will be more difficult to increase your speed.  Alternate your hands during this step. Start with your right hand, then left hand, the right hand. You will use primarily your fingertips to tap the cup.Alternatively, you could tap the table on either side of the cup three times. You would still alternate right hand, left hand, right hand.  Clap above the cup again. Make sure you are still about six inches above the cup. However, this time, just clap once., Grasp the bottom of the cup with your right hand. Pick the cup up to hover about two to three inches above the table. Try to make an audible sound when grasping the cup., Move the cup about three inches to the right. Set the cup down, making another audible noise. The cup should still be rim down., Clap once again above the cup. Continue to keep your hands about six inches above the cup., Turn your right hand so that your thumb is pointing down and your palm is facing the right. Grasp the cup with your hand., Naturally rotate the cup ninety degrees clockwise. The rim, or opening, of the cup should be facing the left., Use the palm of your hand to hit the opening of the cup. Be sure that your hand connects with the rim to make another audible noise., Turn the cup a little further in a fluid motion. The cup just almost be straight up and down with the rim up., Before the cup reaches the straight up and down position, tap the bottom edge of the cup to the table., Continue to turn the cup clockwise. Grasp the bottom of the cup with your left hand. Try to make another audible noise when your left hand touches the cup. These noises maintain the beat of the Cup Song., Cross your right arm to hit the table near the left side of your body., Cross your left arm over you right and firmly place the cup back down on the table. The cup should land back down on its rim near the right side of your body., Continue to practice the Cup Song until you get faster. Once you feel comfortable with the movements, try putting it to the song “When I’m Gone.” The movements repeat throughout the song.	Set the cup on the table. Clap twice. Tap the top of the cup three times. Clap once. Pick up the cup. Move the cup to the right and set it down. Clap once. Grasp the cup with your right hand. Rotate the cup. Hit the rim of the cup. Continue to rotate the cup about forty-five degrees. Tap the edge of the cup on the table. Pass the cup the your left hand. Hit your right hand on the table. Set the cup back down. Repeat.

Renew your registration if it will expire while you store your vehicle, or set a reminder to do so when it is due. Also, contact your insurance company to inform them that you will be storing your car and confirm your car is fully covered by your existing insurance policy.; , It is important that your engine and fluids are in good shape before you store your vehicle for a long period. Otherwise, you risk having your car not start when you are ready to use it again.  Change or top off fluids which may contain sediments as appropriate. This includes oil (Synthetic oil breaks down more slowly with time which makes it preferred for storage), coolant, transmission, and brake fluid.       Run out windshield washer fluid in regions susceptible to freezing to protect spray hoses from freeze and thaw cracks.       Fill your car with gasoline as it leaves less airspace for moist air to enter the engine and form condensation (or ice) and add a fuel stabilizer available at any hardware/parts store.       Check belts, filters, hoses, and other components of your engine. Ensure that all are in working order and clean.  Oil the hinges of the hood, doors, and trunk. Use a graphite-based lubricant for locks. Coat rubber parts of the doors and tires with silicone or white lithium grease. This will help prevent them from freezing shut.  Throw away any trash. Vacuum seats and floor mats to prevent damage. Do not use chemical protectant (i.e. Armor All) on leather, vinyl, and other fabric as these may stain or cause excessive chemical damage to surfaces. Wash the inside of your windows. Getting the interior of your car in shape before storing it will prevent smells and potential damage from the sun or heat.  Wash, buff, and wax your car. Have it detailed, if possible. Make sure to clean the underside of your car as anything stuck to the bottom of the car acts like a sponge, trapping moisture that could lead to the creation of rust. Remove wiper blades or lift them up so they do not become deformed or flat. Ensure all leaves, pine needles, and other debris have been removed from the engine compartment and the windshield wiper cowl (The black thing between the hood and the windshield where the wipers come out of.)  , Electronics can quickly drain the power of your battery, so make sure it is charged before you store your vehicle. You can also consider using a trickle charger. Disconnect your battery if storing for more than 6 months. Take the disconnected battery someplace temperate and dry (A Basement).  This allows the rubber to relax and prevents cracking while allowing you to still drive on them when you remove the vehicle from storage. There are theories of "Flat Spots" if a vehicle is stored on the ground, but newer tires are engineered to prevent this and any flat spots will be worked out within 100 miles (160 km) or so. This does not apply to antique vehicles (Ford Model "X" or vehicles with non-belted tires)  , Vehicle covers protect your car from sun damage, dust, and minor dings. Try to find a vehicle cover designed for long-term storage. These will not trap moisture, but allow your vehicle to breathe.	Check your paperwork. Service your car. Lubricate the car. Clean the interior. Care for the exterior. Ensure that the battery is fully charged. Deflate your tires to 10psi less than manufacturers recommendation and place the vehicle on jack stands if storing for more than 6 months. Cover your vehicle.
It not only keeps you healthy but also you will be happier. As it is rightly said "Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise", so make sure you go to sleep earlier or if there is any problem that you don't keep a perfect time for sleep, then you can use an alarm reminder (cell). No worries. Usually, it requires about 8-9 hours of sleep for an adult and 9-10 hours for all children mostly teenagers and below that level. The benefit of sleeping matters to a much extent in terms of your brain prototyping as it removes all that intoxicated toxins which distracts you, which may obstruct your happiness and perhaps prepares you to be a positive thinker, to start the day better than the previous day. Always be sure to settle down and relax an hour before you go to bed because it will help you drift off more easily; read a book, watch TV (preferably not something violent, aggressive, or even the news) but avoid doing things like homework or anything too stressful that requires you to think, especially if you are a parent or have an elderly relative you need to take care of or a very stressful job.; , Avoid junk foods and prefer eating fruits and green leafy vegetables every day. This will leave you feeling generally more energetic and happy. Replace unhealthy snacks like a chocolate bar containing lots of calories, boasted with a piece of fruit or perhaps some nuts but do make sure to treat yourself once in a while which is okay. Also avoid too many processed foods altogether..Prefer eating apples, watermelons, papaya, grapes etc. the fruits which contain ultimate source of water. These fruits act as an enriched source for growing immune system, skin clarity/glow, and enhances your eye-vision, as opposed to your ear-hearing.  Water is good for everything in your body, the benefits of water are too great to list them all but it's never ending. Water helps to give you clear skin which leaves you feeling happier about your appearance as well! Water is just simply an amazing source in itself for your overall health. So make sure to have it with you at all times whenever you are at work or at studies, or even during exercise sessions. So try to drink 8 glasses a day. Also if you do not really like the taste of water, try flavored or sparkling and maybe add some lemon slices; and of course you can always have Robinson's squash or anything like that.  Whether it's a brisk walk, a quick jog, martial arts, cardiovascular exercises, aerobics, dancing in your room, playing Wii Fit, anything like that will keep you feeling strong, happy and increase immunity of course, even if you are HIV positive or have a weakened immune system, probably. Obviously you don't have to exercise daily because, lets face it, we don't always have the time, unless you are an athlete, gym instructor etc, but try to fit it in a little and there will surely be the major difference in yourself. You will notice that your immunity system has a certain big hand in bringing such a change.  By this is meant, buying those shoes you always wanted, purchasing some inspirational books from the book store in which there is a great desire in you to love to read (genres depending on) like technologies, health, discovering strengths, developing leadership skills, fiction, novels, thriller stories and many more like that. You can also go to a park, a garden, or any place where you think you can spend some time thinking alone.  Bond with true friends and compliment them and appreciate them. Always show them how much you love them and treat them how you would like to be treated. Do not back stab, always stick together and stick up for each other. Do not believe any rumors; and once in a while go out and hang out with your friends; you'll create memories and become closer.  Don't get sad over small issues or take any joke seriously which hurts you. Instead if you feel so hurt, prefer to stay away from that friend, but don't show him that you don't like him/her. Respect your friend from a good perspective. Overall do not be pessimistic; smile and laugh all the time and you will be happy; also who knows maybe your smile might make somebody's day.  This can be art, music, collecting things or whatever that makes you happy and makes you yourself. Try to be active and celebrate your achievements. Give gifts without expecting to receive anything else; keep yourself busy and happy.  Help your mom do the dishes, help out your dad in the kitchen, hoover your room, or anything that could help your family. It will not only make them love you more, but you will feel happy knowing you have done good even if you moved out twenty years ago and are a father yourself.  Unfortunately, sometimes there are people who you know that only cause drama and stress in your life. Therefore, moving away from these types of people is possibly one of the hardest things to do, but when you succeed you will have a weight lifted off your shoulders.

When you find out your audition date, write it on a calendar and work out how long you have to prepare yourself. This will help you to feel more prepared and in control of the situation. It will also help to make sure that you don't forget when it is and suddenly realize that it is in just a few days time (not a good situation!).; , Over-practicing can lead to making you more nervous and less confident for your audition. The ideal is to continue practicing as you have been doing already, and slowly build up the amount of time spent practicing.   For example, practice for an extra 10 minutes each day and then within a week you will be doing more than an hour more than you had been the previous week.  This will help you get an idea of what is expected of you, allowing you to prepare and impress the panel.   See if you can find anything on the internet about the audition process for where you are auditioning. Try to find someone who has auditioned for the same place before. Ask them what happened and how they prepared.  Orchestral excerpts are often an important part of an audition for an orchestra place. They will assess how well you are playing them and how well you have prepared for them. They will want to know that who they choose has the time (and inclination) to practice orchestra parts as well as solo pieces.   Preparation is key. It helps to listen to recordings of the pieces your excerpts are from. It will allow you to get an idea of how it is usually played in an orchestra, which allows you to use aspects such as dynamics. Moreover, you will know what has happened before and after your excerpt, allowing you to add the feeling that you would use if you were playing the whole thing. Choose a piece that you know well and are comfortable with. Avoid trying to impress by pushing yourself. The idea is to nail your audition; don't give even the slightest impression that you're trying too hard. Always have back up pieces ready. It's not unusual to be asked to play something else and you need to be ready.  The feeling of turning up for an audition and realising that you are supposed to be doing aural tests when you haven't done any aural in months is not a good feeling! If you're not sure, either find out in advance, or practice them a little just in case––it's better to be too prepared than not prepared enough in aspects such as this.  If you make sure you have some answers ready, it's harder for the judges to catch you out; it will also help to make you seem more confident, leaving a good impression with the panel.   If you can talk to anyone who has auditioned there in the past, ask them what sort of questions to expect. This will help you be more prepared and confident.  Sleep will help if you're nervous. Don't let nerves keep you up all night as this will not help you in your audition.  Breakfast gives you energy for the rest of the morning; this is important for practicing in the morning and for your audition.   Bananas are both filling and help target nervousness. There is a chemical in bananas which helps you feel less nervous so this could be an ideal breakfast.If you don't like bananas, apparently chocolate has a similar effect.,   Find out what time you have to be at your audition. Work out your expected journey length and therefore what time you have to leave. If you are traveling by bus or car, leave extra time in case of traffic, check online for train delays or cancellations or, if you're traveling by car or bus, check online for traffic on your route. Plan your morning around the time you have to leave. It is good to arrive at an audition a little earlier than they are expecting you. Say your audition is at 11:30am but you get 15 minutes to practice before it. They are expecting you to arrive at 11:15, then you should probably aim to arrive by no later than 11:10, if possible. Therefore, if you expect the journey to take 25 minutes and you decide to allow 10 minutes for traffic, you would be leaving home at 10:35.  In your warm up time, it is helpful to not spend the whole of your warm up time practicing your audition material. Maybe start by playing slow scales or a study to help keep your mind off of the audition. It might sound stupid but it helps to not think about the audition before you go in. If you think about it too much, you might begin to panic and over think it, it's best to stay calm.  Liken the audition to a private performance you're giving to a few people. This will help you stay calm.   Ways to help yourself stay calm include things such as breathing exercises, thinking about other things and resorting to any of your own methods that you've developed over time.  Walk in very confidently, give them a smile and maybe have a little chat if they initiate conversation (not too much, or for too long though, and stay on the topic of music and your audition if you do).   If they ask you anything, answer calmly and collectedly, don't answer too quickly, as this can make you seem nervous but don't take too long or it will make you seem under-prepared and disorganized.  It will leave a good impression.  There is no point at all dwelling on your audition. No matter how much you overthink it and overanalyze your performance, you can't change it now.   Don't overanalyze, it will make you feel bad about yourself - after all, the panel probably didn't even notice that wrong note in bar 40.	Make a note of the date. Don't over practice in the lead up to your audition. Try to find out what to expect in your audition. If you are expected to do orchestral excerpts, don't forget to prepare them. Make sure you know whether you are expected to do aural tests or sight reading in your audition. If you are going to have an interview, prepare some answers in advance. Make sure you get a good nights sleep the night before. Eat a good breakfast. Help yourself feel less nervous by making sure you know exactly when you have to do things. Don't over practice. Remember to just do your best and don't worry about the outcome. Make yourself appear confident to the panel, even if you don't feel confident. Say thank you when you leave. Don't dwell on your audition after it's finished.
Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation row of chain stitches until the scarf reaches your desired length.   The total number of chain stitches in your foundation must be a multiple of three. For a child's scarf, 90 chains will work well. For an adult's scarf 180 chains will work well. If you need help making a slipknot or chain stitch, please consult the "Tips" section of this article.  Work two double crochet into the third chain currently from the hook.   When counting chains, do not count the loop already on your hook. See the "Tips" section for more information on making the double crochet stitch.  Skip two chains, then double crochet three times into the chain after that.   Repeat this pattern across the entire row. If done correctly, you should have worked three double crochets into the final chain of your foundation row.  Chain three at the end of the row, then work three double crochets into each chain-two space you created during your first pass.   Once you reach the beginning of the row again, slip stitch once into the top of your original chain-three. This completes the first full row. See the “Tips” section if you need instruction on creating slip stitches.  Chain three at the start of the row. Work a series of double crochets into each space of the previous row.   For each space:  Work three double crochets. Chain three. Work three double crochets into the same space.   Repeat this pattern all the way down the row. Work this same pattern in the corner of the first row, as well.  Once you reach the end of the row, double back by working the same pattern into each space just created by your first pass through the second row.   Continue back down the row in this manner, but do not work this pattern into the last space of the row.  In the last space of the row, work three double crochets. Chain three, then work two double crochets into the same space.   Note that your initial chain-three of this second row counts as a double crochet stitch, which is why you should only make two double crochets at the end instead of the three used in every other space. After working these stitches, slip stitch into the top of the chain-three made at the beginning of your second row.  Chain three at the beginning of the row, then work an alternating series of double crochet into each chain-three space of your previous row.   In the first space:  Work three double crochets. Chain three. Work three double crochets into the same space.   In the second space:  Work three double crochets.   Alternate back and forth between these two patterns across the entire row.  Once you reach the end of the row, repeat the same alternating pattern, working back across the stitches you just completed until you return to the beginning of the third row.  Once you reach the end of the row, slip stitch into the original chain-three at the start of the third row.   This action completes the third and final row of the scarf.  Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.   Weave this tail and the tail at the start of the scarf into the back of your stitches. This step completes the project.	Work a foundation chain. Double crochet twice into the third chain. Double crochet three times into every third chain. Work back down the other side. Double crochet and chain stitch across the second row. Work back down the other side. Double crochet at the end of the second row. Double crochet and chain stitch across the third row. Reverse back down the third row. Slip stitch once more. Fasten off.
Vibrato is an effect that warbles a note while you play. Vibrato is achieved by bending and unbending your finger as you play on a string.This dynamic is usually marked as “Vibr” underneath the notes that should be played as vibrato., Pizzicato is a technique, usually noted as "pizz" or sometimes spelled out in its entirety, that indicates you should play a note by plucking the violin string with your finger.   If there is no obvious “pizz” or “pizzicato” designated, then assume the musical piece should be played as “arco,” or using the bow to play the notes., Pizzicato may also be designated with the Bartok pizzicato symbol, also known as a “snap pizzicato.” This symbol, a circle with a vertical line through the top, will appear above the note to be plucked. This type of pizzicato is given an extra snap by pinching the string with two fingers and snapping it back into the finger board., A tremolo is a style of playing very quick, rapid sounds as the bow draws back and forth across the string. The tremolo is noted with thick, short diagonal lines drawn through the note or the stem of the note.They can be either measured or unmeasured.   One diagonal line means 1/8 note tremolo (measured). Two diagonal lines mean 1/16 note tremolo (measured). Three diagonal lines mean an unmeasured tremolo.  Style markings give you an indication of the mood with which to play music. These are typically noted in Italian.Some of the more common words you’ll see are:    Con: With  Poco a poco: Little by little  Meno mosso: Less movement  Dolce: Sweetly  Allegro: Quick and lively  , Dynamics in sheet music indicate how loud or quiet you should play. These are typically indicated below the staff and will change as you progress through the music. Written in Italian, these range from very quiet (pianissimo) to mezzo (medium) to fortissimo (very loud).Dynamics usually show up as lower-case letters, such as p (piano), mf (mezzo forte), ff (fortissimo) and so on. Crescendos and diminuendos are also used, which indicate that your playing should get louder or quieter gradually. They are typically indicated by a long, thin carrot or accent mark.	Play “Vibr” as vibrato. Play “pizz” as pizzicato. Play a Bartok pizzicato. Play a tremolo. Understand style markings. Pay attention to dynamics.
Look up the words to the song if you have any confusion about what you're hearing. Keep singing along with the lyrics in front of you until you feel like you have them memorized, likely five or six times depending on the song.   As you get comfortable, close your eyes and sing sections to see if you have them down.  While everyone is born with a set vocal "range," taking care of your voice and practicing vocal exercises can make the difference between nailing a song and struggling. And, though everyone has a set range, you need to practice in order to reach that range. to hit every note.   Always warm up your voice before singing.Try not to scream or yell during the day, as it strains your vocal chords. Have a reference note on hand if you are having trouble staying in tune.  Practice each verse on it's own, perfecting one before moving on to the next. Mastering the hard parts instead of trying to sing the entire song every time will highlight and eliminate mistakes faster.  Keep singing the song until you feel comfortable, and don't be afraid to "make it your own" with little changes and personality. try to find an instrumental version of the song so that you can focus solely on your own vocals.   If you can, record yourself singing and listen in to find any mistakes. Play a melody instrument, like a guitar or piano, so you can sing without the backing track to guide you.  To make a song truly good you need to dive into why the song is important to you. Why did you choose to learn this song, and how do the lyrics affect you? By tapping into these feelings you'll start singing the song with a passion and uniqueness that will make the song shine.   Don't over think this -- just keep practicing until you concentrate less on the notes and more on the feelings behind them.	Memorize the lyrics using a book or online source. Practice good singing habits. Break down the song into smaller parts. Practice as often as you can. Find your connection to the lyrics.
, Add 1⁄2 cup (120 ml) of clear glue for every 1 cup (240 ml) of kinetic sand.,, You can leave out the food coloring, but you should use it if you want to change the color of your slime.  Adding food coloring may not work well if your kinetic sand is already a bright color. You'll need a pale sand, like white sand, to make sure the color shows up properly.  This will help the slime to solidify. You should add 1⁄4 teaspoon (1.2 ml) baking soda for every 1 1⁄2 cups (350 ml) of slime.,, The lotion will soften the slime so it isn't too gritty to play with.  You may need to knead the slime with your hands to fully mix in the lotion.  Store it in an airtight container.	Take as much kinetic sand as you want and put it in your bowl. , Pour in the clear glue.Add 2-4 squirts of lotion and mix thoroughly. Add a few drops of food coloring, if desired, and mix until blended. Add baking soda.Mix until the slime is solid. Add 3-4 squirts of lotion and mix. Play with your slime!
To practice the knit stitch, all you need is a pair of knitting needles and a ball of yarn. You can use any size needles you like to practice, but make sure that the needle size is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. You can find the recommended needle sizes for different types of yarn by checking the yarn label.; , Casting on is how you begin every knitting project. Start by looping the yarn around your finger twice and then pull the back loop through the front loop to make a slipknot.Then, slip the slipknot onto the needle in your non-dominant hand. Loop the yarn around the needle and pull new yarn through it make more cast on stitches.          If you are following a pattern, then cast on the number of stitches that the pattern specifies. If you just want to practice the knit stitch, then cast on 10 stitches.  You should hold the needle with the cast on stitches on it in your non-dominant hand and the other needle in your dominant hand. Hold the needles near the points for better control of the knitting motion.  Place the needles so that the right needle crosses behind the left needle. Then, insert the tip of your right needle into the back of the first stitch on the left needle.          When working the knit stitch, it is important to always go in through the back of the stitch.  Your working yarn should always be behind the needles while you knit, so position it this way if it is not already behind the stitches.  Wrap your working yarn around the tip of the back needle, so that the yarn hangs between the two needles.This yarn will form your first new knit stitch.          If you are right handed, then you will loop the yarn around counterclockwise. If you are left handed, then you will loop the yarn around clockwise.  Use your non-dominant hand to hold the free end of the yarn and ensure that the loop is secure. Then, pull the tip of the right needle gently back through the first loop towards you, bringing the yarn with it.  Let the old loop slide off the end of the needle.Keep the yarn taut after each stitch to keep the loops close to the needle but not so tight that you can't slide the needle into the loops.          Be careful as you slid off the cast on stitch. Make sure that only the stitch that you knit into comes off.  You should have one new knit stitch on your right (dominant hand) needle. Repeat the process to knit the other cast on stitches.  When all of the stitches are on your right needle, you have finished your first row of knitting. You can continue knitting your other rows in the same way until you finish your project or until you feel like you have mastered the knit stitch.  To knit the second row as well, you do not have to reverse the movement. Simply switch the needle with all of the stitches on it over to your non-dominant hand again. You are now ready to start knitting your second row in exactly the same way as you did the first row.  This produces what is otherwise known as the garter stitch.If your pattern calls for the garter stitch, then you will simply need to knit all of the rows.  Once you're skilled at knitting the knit stitch, you will find it becomes second nature and you'll be using it to make garments, accessories and much more. Practice the knit stitch until you feel comfortable using it.	Get a pair of knitting needles and yarn. Cast on your stitches. Hold the needles in your hands. Push the tip of the right needle into the first loop on the left needle. Check that the yarn is lying at the back of the needles. Loop the yarn over the back needle. Pull the new yarn through the cast on stitch. Slip the cast on stitch off as you pull the new loop through. Continue to knit all of the cast-on stitches in the same way. Complete the first row. Hold the needle that has all the stitches in your left hand. Knit the knit stitch row after row. Show off your work.
Local nurseries typically sell plants raised in your geographic area, which means the plants are hardy and acclimated to the regional temperatures. Online distributors and mail-order catalogs may ship dormant roots instead live plants because they survive better through the shipping process. The dormant roots will take longer to grow, but should produce healthy plants.  Most container-bound perennials at garden centers come with tags indicating growing conditions required for healthy plants. Examine the tags to ensure the perennials you purchase will grow well in the planting bed you prepared.   Consider the height of each plant. Keep in mind that taller plants may block the view (and light) of shorter plants.       Consider the bloom color of the perennials. Bright colored plants can brighten up shady spots, while dark colored plants may add depth and texture to a full sun garden. Some gardeners select color palettes for their gardens. If you choose a color palette, ensure the bloom color of the perennial complements your palette.  Plant Hardiness zone. The zones indicate which plants are suited for winter conditions in your geographic area. This is especially important when selecting perennials as they overwinter and come back year after year. If you select a plant not appropriate for your hardiness zone, it may die during the winter months. Plant hardiness zone maps are available online.  Perennials will grow larger each year. When selecting perennials, take into account the size of the mature plant, which is not the same as the container-bound plant purchased at a local garden center.  Examine each perennial before purchasing.   Choose perennials that look fresh and vigorous. Avoid leggy or floppy plants. Inspect the plant for indication of insect damage or disease, such as broken stems, bent leaves or withered leaves. If a perennial is infested with a foliage disease, it could spread into your garden and damage other plants.	Buy perennials at local nurseries, garden centers or through online distributors or mail-order catalogs. Choose perennials that will thrive in the prepared planting bed. Select perennials rated for your U.S.D.A. Consider the mature size of each perennial. Select healthy plants.
The baking sheet needs to have raised sides, or the melted sugar will slide off. If you don't have cooking spray, wrap the inside of the sheet with tin foil or parchment paper.; , Place the pot on the stove. You must use light corn syrup, or the glass will turn out too dark.  The sugar will boil too quickly if you do, and start to caramelize. Stir the ingredients often so that you don't scorch the bottom of the pot. As the the mixture heats up, it'll go from a cloudy color to clear. When it boils, it will start to form foamy bubbles at top.          A silicone spatula will make clean up a lot easier than a wooden, plastic, or metal one.  You can find one in a baking and cooking supply shop, an arts and crafts shop, or in the baking section of a super market. You will need this to get the temperature of your candy.          If your candy thermometer does not have a clip, tie it loosely to the handle of the pot with a piece of string.  The candy must reach 300°F (148.89°C). This is known as the "hard crack" phase.If you do not get the candy hot enough, it will not set properly. Your candy will end up sticky no matter how long you let it sit or cool.It will take about an hour for the candy to reach the right temperature.   The temperature will stop rising for a moment somewhere between 210 and 240°F (98.89 and 115.56°C). This is because the water is evaporating. Once the water has evaporated, the temperature will begin rising again. Keep the temperature between 300 and 310°F (148.89 and 154.45°C). Do not allow it to reach 320°F (160°C) or your sugar glass will caramelize and turn brown.If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the candy by dropping a tiny amount into a glass of cold water. The candy has reached the "hard crack" phase if it hardens into threads., This will minimize any bubbles. The candy will be thick, and spread slowly across the baking sheet.  This will help the candy spread out evenly so that the finished glass is smooth and not lumpy. Leave the candy to dry for about an hour.          Don't move the candy until the full hour has passed. It will be be cool to the touch after 45 minutes, but it won't be hardened.  If you used a cooking spray, flip the baking sheet upside down over a table. The candy should simply fall out. If you used tin foil or parchment paper, pop the candy out of the baking sheet. Then, peel the foil or paper off of the candy. If your candy does not come away easily, do this:          Take a knife and heat it up under hot water. Cut along the edge where the glass meets the edge of the pan. Use the knife to carefully loosen the candy from the baking sheet. Flip the baking sheet over, then slowly lift the sheet away from the sugar glass that is resting on your hand.	Line a baking sheet with foil or spray with cooking spray. Pour the sugar, water, light corn syrup, and cream of tartar into a pot. Slowly bring the ingredients to a boil over medium heat while stirring them.Don't use high heat. Clip a candy thermometer to the inside wall of the pot. Heat the candy to 300°F (148.89°C), then remove it from heat. Slowly pour the hot candy into the baking sheet. Place the baking sheet onto an even surface and let the candy harden. Remove the hardened candy from the baking sheet.
The purpose of the learner license is to give you the opportunity to drive, with a qualified adult in the car, and practice your driving skills before getting a provisional license.  While you could get your learner license at 15, you must be at least 16 years old to get a provisional license. This provisional license will be the one you use until you turn 18.  With your learner license, you must have a licensed adult over age 21 in the car with you, and you must keep a log of the hours you drive. At least 10 hours must be night driving., You will drive with a Department of Public Safety officer riding with you, to see that you have acquired the skills of safe driving.  With a provisional license, the following rules apply:You may only drive between 5:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. You may drive by yourself or with family members, whether or not an adult is with you. You may have one passenger under 21 who is not a family member, but no more than one. You may not use any cell phone, whether hands-free or not, while driving.

The threaded part should be the same length, and the threads should match. If you're unsure what plug to buy, take an old one with you to the store and have the counter person match it for you. Also, they may be able to tell you the correct plug gap for your application.          Even though new plugs come pre-gapped, you might want to double check the gap of the new plug. It should be within the engine manufacturer's specifications. Plug gages are available at your local parts counter, usually for a dollar.  Apply a little anti-seize on the threads so that the plug will unscrew easily next time you want to change it. Don't get any on the electrode, since that may cause it to fail. Screw the plug on by hand, twisting it clockwise, until it stays in place. Use a torque wrench fitted over the spark plug socket to finish screwing it on until it's fairly tight.          Do not over screw the plug; if you tighten it too much, you could cause damage to the part or the head. There are some engines for which a torque wrench is absolutely necessary, because the spark plugs are indexed. Not getting the electrode into the proper position can cause damage. These engines often require plugs be purchased from the dealer so proper spark plug indexing is achieved. The plug's washer should be compressed against the mounting surface. For spark plugs in hard to reach areas, a piece of vacuum hose attached to the top of the plug will help align the plug and avoid cross threading as the plug is screwed in.  Add a small amount of dielectric grease to the inside of the boot. Pick it up by the boot and place it back where it came from. The boot should snap in snugly. Give it a tug to make sure it stays in place.  Working one plug at a time, use the same method to finish replacing all of the plugs.  Inspect the wires for gouges or rips. If they look like they're in bad shape, look into changing them, too.	Double check that your replacement plug is the same size as the old plug. Seat the new plug. Replace the plug wire. Change the remaining plugs. Consider replacing your spark plug wires.
There is display obligation in most countries.

Deep scratches in leather furniture may be scuffed and dirty, so before you attempt to repair the area, make sure it’s clean first. Take a clean cloth and dip it in rubbing alcohol, then lightly buff the scratched area.         Rubbing alcohol dries quickly. Let the area sit for about 10 minutes, and it should be dry. This method works most effectively with finished leather. If you have a deep cut in aniline leather, it may be irreparable.  Unlike with a minor scratch, if your leather furniture is deeply scratched, the leather may be uneven, scuffed, or torn around the fringe of the scratch. Take a pair of scissors, and clip away any loose threads so that the area around the cut is smooth.         Alternately, take a piece of fine-grit sandpaper (around 1200 grit) and sand the area surrounding the cut until it’s smooth., Called “filler” for short, this material has the consistency of putty and will fill the gaps or cracks in the scratched section of your furniture. Using your finger or a small spatula, cover the scratch with heavy filler, until the scratched surface is even with the rest of the furniture’s surface.Once you have applied the heavy filler, let it dry for about 30 minutes.          Once the filler has been applied, take another sheet of 1200 grit sandpaper and smooth the surface of the filler. Leather heavy filler should be available at your local hardware store, or at a leather-goods store. Additionally, the furniture manufacturer may sell bonder or filler, or even send you some for free.  Now that the scratch has been sealed and covered with heavy filler, you’ll need to color the material to match the rest of the furniture piece. Apply the colorant to a sponge, and dab it evenly across the area covered by the heavy filler.         Apply as many coats as necessary to match the color of the furniture, but remember to let each coat dry before applying a new one. To purchase leather colorant, you’ll likely need to visit a leather-goods store or a furniture store that specializes in leather.  This will seal and protect the dyed heavy filler, and should prevent the same area from being scratched again. Pour a small amount of the finish onto a sponge or clean cloth, and then lightly rub onto the scratched area of your furniture.         Apply up to 3 or 4 coats for a consistent finish. As for the leather colorant, you’ll probably need to purchase the leather finish at leather-goods store or a furniture store that specializes in leather. You may be able to purchase the heavy filler, colorant, and finish all together in a leather-repair set.	Clean the area with rubbing alcohol. Sand or clip loose fibers around the edges of the cut. Apply leather heavy filler to the scratched area. Apply the correct shade of leather colorant. Apply a leather finish to the colored area.
Inquire at local churches, colleges, or music shops. Many colleges have undergraduate programs in applied organ, and music theory in general. You can also check organ-related periodicals for teachers. But the best way is to contact your local chapter of The American Guild of Organists, and search for a teacher through them. If you choose to talk to a local Church Organist, make sure that they are well-qualified to teach.When you make contact with a teacher, be sure to find out if you meet their minimum requirements to begin lessons (for example, ability to sight read and/or a certain level of experience on the piano).  In order to learn the organ, you will need to practice outside of your lessons. An organ is a large and expensive instrument, so before you can begin serious organ study, you must ensure that you have access to a practice instrument. Speak to your instructor about the possibility of practicing at the studio, inquire at local churches, or obtain a small (or digital) organ for home.  An introduction to organ book will help you to study the basics alongside what you learn during your lessons. Most music stores will carry such a book. Speak to your organ instructor about a book they recommends to work well alongside their teaching.  Pedals are a unique aspect of organ playing, and having the proper footwear will help you develop efficient technique. Additionally, since you will only be wearing your organ shoes when sitting at the organ, they will not pick up dirt or grime which can damage the pedals.You can purchase them online for around sixty dollars. Some instructors may require you to have proper organ shoes before you can play on their organ.	Find an organ teacher. Gain access to an organ. Purchase an introductory level organ book. Buy a pair of organ shoes.

A Moebius cast on requires the same basic items as normal knitting in the round. You will need to have a pair of circular needles that measure at least 32”. You will also need a ball of yarn.Make sure that your needle size is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. Check the yarn label to find the recommended needle size.; , To start your Moebius cast on, you will need to make a slipknot. You can easily do this by making two loops and pulling one loop through the other.Slide the slipknot onto the needle, and then tug on the tail of the working yarn to tighten the slipknot. Move the slipknot so that it is on the wire., Next, you will need to make a loop in the wire of your circular needles. They should have a natural loop in them, so you can let them go into this shape. When the wire is in a loop, align the needles so that they are right alongside the edges of the loop., With your circular needle wire in a loop, cast one stitch onto your needle so that it is parallel with the slipknot you cast onto your wire., Next, you will need to cast a stitch onto the wire. To do this, take your right needle and bring it into the wire circle and then under the circle to the other side. Then, yarn over, and bring the needle back to its starting position., When the needle is back where it started, loop the yarn over the needle again. Then, you will follow this up by bringing the needle back through the circle again and yarning over again., Keep repeating the sequence of bringing the needle through the circle and under the wire, yarning over, bringing it back up, and yarning over again.Keep going until you have filled the circle with stitches. If you are following a pattern, then keep going until you have the recommended number of stitches.	Get a 32” circular needle and some yarn. Make a slipknot and slide it onto the needle. Make a loop with the wire and align it with your needles. Cast one stitch onto the needle using the normal cast on method. Bring the right needle under the wire and yarn over. Yarn over the needle. Repeat the sequence.
Adjust your car and fasten your seat belt.  It is similar to an automatic, except it has only one gear. The options should be listed in this order: P, R, N, and D. Depending on the vehicle, it may have another option or two.  P is for park. This gear is designed specifically for parking a vehicle. R is for reverse, used for backing up a vehicle. N is for neutral. This is used when you do not need to change the speed of the car, or for coasting. Keep in mind: Coasting is illegal in many U.S. states, and should be avoided.  D is for drive, the option used for moving the vehicle forward. Operating a CVT is almost the same as automatic, except that with a CVT, you will never feel the vehicle shift - it is only one gear.  This allows you to press the button on the lever that allows you to select the gear you want., Many newer cars have cameras that drivers use to check how they have backed up the car., Before you shift to this from reverse, come to a complete stop., Then set your parking brake up.	Get into the vehicle. Look at the choices available with a CVT transmission. Put your foot on the brake. When driving in R (reverse), check your surroundings for safety. If you select D (drive), operate the vehicle like you normally do. Come to a full stop before shifting to P (park).
Poorly adjusted mirrors could result in you losing perspective while parking. This can hurt your ability to gauge the distance between your vehicles and obstructions. You’ll want as clear and complete a view of the area around your vehicle as possible.   Even if you are more confident in your parking skills, you should always double check your blind spots to ensure you don’t back into kids, pedestrians, or moving objects, like strollers and shopping carts. Larger vehicles may have additional mirror mounted to the body of the vehicle to improve visibility. These additional mirrors can be easily forgotten by casual large vehicle drivers. Check these regularly when parking.; , The more space you have to pull into your spot, the more space you’ll have to maneuver and make adjustments while parking. You might give yourself more space by parking in an empty part of a parking lot, or you could also choose a spot that is surrounded by smaller, more compact vehicles.   Smaller vehicles on either side of your large truck will take up less space in their own parking spot, giving you more leeway as you park., The increased weight of a large vehicle will require you to brake sooner than you would for a normal car, especially if you have a heavy load you are transporting. Taking your time when parking your large vehicle can prevent costly errors, like damaging cars around you or hitting a parking barrier., This is perhaps the safest route if you are less confidant in your large vehicle parking ability. Choose a location of the parking area that is free of other cars. Cut your wheel in the direction you are turning to move into the spot.   You may notice your front end swinging over the parking spot lines into the spot beside you. This is due to the fact that larger vehicles require a wider turning radius to complete turns. You may need to adjust your vehicle in your space after pulling in. Put your vehicle in reverse, check your mirrors and blind spots, then back up. When you pull back into your spot after backing out, adjust your wheel to straighten out your vehicle as you pull into the spot again.  The length of your large vehicle will require more space spent turning for you to straighten it out and pull it evenly into its spot. Turning as you would normally in a regular car can lead to over or underturning, potentially into other vehicles. To prevent this you should:Maneuver your vehicle as far away from the parking spot as you are able. The more space you have to approach, the easier it will be for you to straighten your back end and pull into the spot. Cut your wheel hard in the direction of the spot you are parking. You’ll want the front end of your truck to enter the spot as straight as possible. Check your mirrors constantly while pulling into your spot. The side of your vehicle may still be straightening, and you’ll need to keep a careful eye to ensure you do not bump or scratch other vehicles., The more aligned your back end is with the spot you are aiming to park in, the less turning you will have to do and the easier your parking job will be. A three-point turn is where you turn in one direction as far as you are able, put your vehicle in reverse to straighten your front end, and then finish your turn by continuing it.You can use this while parking by:   Pulling your front end close to one of the vehicles next to the spot in which you are parking. Putting your vehicle in reverse and straightening it to line up with your spot as much as possible. Be sure to check your mirrors and blind spots so you don’t hit any pedestrians or cars parked behind you.  Now that your car is more lined up with the spot, it’s likely you’ll only have to make slight adjustments to your course as you pull into it. Executing this move in tight spaces is a valuable skill when driving a large vehicle, so you may want to practice how to make a three-point turn.	Check your mirrors before parking. Give yourself plenty of space. Park slowly and brake early. Pull in to wide open spots. Avoid overshooting or undercutting your turn. Straighten your vehicle with a three-point turn. Pull into your spot evenly out of your three-point turn.
Select the flowers. String them up upside down over an empty space such as high up in a closet doorway (provided you don't need to close the door). The spot chosen should be in a dry area of the house (definitely not in your bathroom). If it's warm that is helpful but not too humid. Leave the flowers strung up this way for two to three weeks. This will ensure that they are dried in an upright position and that the bloom isn't falling over.   The knots on the stem will also become looser due to water loss so you may want to check them and carefully tighten them every 5-7 days or so. Take down when dry. Use in dried floral arrangements, potpourri or for craft projects.  A flower press is a traditional method of pressing flowers, petals and leaves flat, drying them in the process. This method is only good for when you want flat flowers for artwork or scrapbooking. More information on using a flower press or pressing flowers generally (with a book, etc.) can be found here and here.  Florists can use modern techniques, such as silica gel, hot air drying, freeze drying and using a molecular sieve. The end results will be very professional, which makes this approach a good one for preserving wedding flowers and other flowers with important memories.	Hang the flowers to dry them. Use a flower press. Ask a florist to dry the flowers for you. Find other drying methods here.
Are you really ready to go on professionally? You can ask yourself this even if you're in high school. It's never too early to start. You just need to have it in you. Make sure you have been studying seriously so far and have gotten at least more than skin deep into horn playing.; ,  The ability to do lip trills. Flexibility between the extreme high and low ranges that includes proper dropping of the jaw in the low range. Skill in transposing from Horn in E, Eb, D, C, Bb, A, G, and even Db, Ab, and B for the occasional Verdi and Brahms repertoire that require those keys. These three skills are essential for the aspiring virtuoso, whether your aspiration is to be a horn soloist or an orchestral player.  In this path you take, you'll be hearing a lot of technique correcting. People have gone through several teachers telling them how to play horn, and eventually you'll fall into a style that is overall correct, but make sure you take high quality lessons from a good, professional teacher who is actively playing in groups and has a good standing. Don't be afraid to ask for their resume. Better to pay for a well rounded experienced and active musician than a secondary school teacher who only plays horn once in a blue moon.  A good example of accepting change is realizing how many different ways your right hand can be in the bell, rather than trying to figure out one perfect way that doesn't exist.  Start asking for CDs of horn players for Christmas. Get your hands on recordings of Dennis Brain, Barry Tuckwell, Roland Berger, Michael Thompson, Hermann Baumann, Eric Ruske, etc. Also, look up very well known horn players, and listen to their music and study their technique. Pick one to be your role model, and even pretend to be that horn player while you play. It can help confidence. Listen to a lot of music. This is essential in developing your own tonal concept.  Have a pile of concertos, excerpts, etude books, etc. You'll want plenty of materials to have while studying in graduate school and such. The more you know about musically, the better. It's not a bad idea to know Horn in concert H means "concert B natural" either.  Practice as much as you can. Now, here's the big thing: don't think you're great because you practice 10 hours a day. It's always quality over quantity. Ask yourself: did you play well? Did you accomplish something? What did you accomplish? Never ever expect 2 hours of tooting random notes will get you anywhere.  Get out there and perform. It doesn't matter if there's no work, make work. Try going to a church every week and play a new piece weekly for them. Teach the rest of your horn section during high school, relaying things you've learned. Get involved with regional competitions, local gigs, set up a brass quintet with some friends, etc.  Audition for Julliard, Curtis, and other prestigious schools. Try out for the NY Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, or the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. If you don't dream big, you won't go big. You'll face some pretty tough failures in your life (rejection from Julliard after putting all this work into it) as well as some great successes (scholarships, job offers, etc). Just go for it!	Situate yourself. Learn and master advanced techniques on the horn. Accept change. Boost your repertoire. Build up on your music. Practice. Apply yourself. Don't be afraid to make it big when the time comes to make a big decision, such as applying for music school.
To rid a car from odor, determine the source by considering typical origins of odors. The most common is kids spilling food or beverages, and if this is obvious, get a can of carpet and upholstery cleaner and treat it according to label.; , If the odor is a mildew-like musk, you may have a leaky floorboard, for instance a loose chassis drain plug allowing rain to splash inside. A wet car carpet will grow mildew and mold rapidly, especially with closed windows. Feel the carpet, especially the lower floor board sections where water might accumulate. When "damp spots" are located, apply a weak solution of chlorine bleach, not exceeding 2 oz per gallon. Then speed dry with either a wet/dry shop vac or airing out with windows down in the sun. With unexplained floor wet spots, crawl under the car and look for plugs missing and openings. These plugs are black rubber inserts, about 1.5"X 3", placed in lower parts of the car floor.  Most back seats remove by lifting at the front edge and sliding forward. The force required to remove the seat varies and some cars may have threaded fasteners which would need removing.  Since AC acts as a dehumidifier, this filter can dampen with condensation, becoming moldy, blowing odors into the car. By selecting 'return air' or 'recirculate' on the AC controls, less moisture enters the system, decreasing the water being removed at the evaporating coil, decreasing possibility of smelly mold. The filter is replaceable but complicated, so consult a professional in this instance.  It is not unusual for these to cause odors, but not normally detectable except when the car is idling or traveling at low speed. Gasoline odor is especially serious, and if you think you may have a fuel leak it should get immediate attention. Antifreeze has a unique, sickly-sweet odor, and a radiator leak will cause the engine temperature to rise, boil over and quit. Oil leaks, especially above the exhaust manifold where the dripping oil actually burns off, can smell, but at highway speed it will likely disperse to drivers behind you. An engine exhaust leak has very low odor potential, but if you suspect one, it can be the most serious of all. When the engine runs, these fumes can accumulate inside the car, becoming very toxic when concentrated. Mostly, significant exhaust leaks cause loud exhaust sounds.  If you have not succeeded in finding the odor source, it could be road-kill under the chassis. You may notice this distinct odor at one of the quarter panels, and a car wash pressure washer, to thoroughly spray out the suspect area, could help. Do not spray water up into the engine compartment and knock wiring couplers, vacuum hoses and even spark plug wires loose. , A variety of commercial deodorizers and cleaning products help, also, an open a box of baking soda. Shoe "Odor Eaters" can be placed under seats, but unless you eliminate the odor source, anything is just a stop-gap solution.	Look for an obvious source. Do a little detective work. If you haven't found the odor source, check the glove compartment, ash receptacles, trunk, and beneath seats. Check the owner's manual to see if your car has a cabin air filter in the AC duct work. Check the engine and exhaust system. Look under the car and around the tires. Inspect behind the front grill for feathers of a bird stuck in the radiator.  , Because types and sources of odors vary, this article doesn't cover remedies for the odor itself, concentrating on locating and removing it.
Although helpful for those collectors who collect comic books for the stories or the artwork, reprint comics such as "Famous First Editions" have nowhere near the monetary value of the original issues they are reprints of.   The only reprint exception is Superman #1, which reprinted the Superman story in Action Comics #1. It was the first comic named for a superhero character, however, and subsequent issues featured original stories of the Man of Tomorrow.  As comic book companies became aware of the collector market, they began pandering to it with various gimmicks designed to boost sales. Although these gimmicks made money for the comics companies, these comics were produced in large enough quantities that they provide little value for collectors who collect for profit. Such gimmicks include:   Shipping new comics pre-bagged. Although collectors bag their comics to preserve their value, buying a comic already bagged forces the buyer to choose whether to keep the comic in its bag to preserve its value or open the bag to read it and reduce its value. The hope was that buyers would buy 2 copies, 1 to read and 1 to keep. Variant covers. Some comics were released with 2, 3, or even over 50 different covers, each representing a different scene in the story inside. While some of these are incredibly valuable, without knowing what you are looking for, you could spend money on books with virtually no value. Since the mid-2000s, most variants are either released tied to an event (comic-con, or store release), or limited based on the number of copies of a comic that a store orders (1 variant per 100 copies of the normal cover that the store purchases). Knowing how rare a book is an how many were printed makes all of the difference in the value potential. Gimmick covers. In addition to variant covers, other cover gimmicks used include holograms, foil stamping, or glow-in-the-dark covers. Some gimmicks may have been tied to milestone issues, such as the silver foil cover for Issue 25 of Valiant's "Magnus, Robot Fighter," but in most cases, the stories were not notably better than those in issues without the gimmicks.	Avoid special reprint comics. Avoid gimmicks.
Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission are designed not to start if the transmission is not in park or neutral. Starting a car while in drive could result in the vehicle lurching forward, causing damage or injuring someone. Check your shift lever to ensure it is completely in park or neutral, then attempt to turn the key again. Be sure the indicator on the shift lever is pointing at the “P” for park. Try taking the vehicle out of park and putting it back in if you can, then turn the key again.; , If your key won’t turn when you insert it into the ignition, it may be because the key has been damaged and no longer engages the correct pins to the depth necessary to spin the cylinder. Examine the key for signs of excessive wear, rounding or broken teeth. Any of these could result in the key failing to turn in the ignition.If the key is damaged, it will have to be replaced. Some keys require programming from the dealership when replaced. Refer to your owner’s manual to check the requirements for your vehicle.  Just as worn or damaged teeth can prevent the key from turning, anything stuck to the key will also cause it to improperly engage the pins in the ignition cylinder. If you used your key to open a package recently, for instance, there may be bits of tape stuck to the teeth of the key, preventing it from working.Clean any debris or dirt off of the key, then re-insert it and try again. Do not use your keys to open packages or do anything else other than start your vehicle.  If you were applying any pressure to the steering wheel when you turned the car off, it may have locked the wheel in place with the steering pin. Check to see if your steering wheel is locked by trying to turn the wheel. If it will not move, or moves only very slightly, it is likely locked. A locked steering wheel will not allow the ignition to engage.When you move the wheel back and forth, you will feel it stop abruptly as it comes into contact with the steering wheel lock. If your wheel was turned slightly without you applying any pressure when you turned the car off, it still may engage the steering wheel lock.  In order to unlock the steering wheel, insert the key into the ignition and attempt to turn it. While applying light pressure to the key, wiggle the steering wheel back and forth until the lock disengages. This will allow the steering wheel and the key to turn.The key will be able to turn freely in the ignition once the steering wheel is unlocked. If the key still fails to turn after the wheel is unlocked, there is another issue.	Ensure the vehicle is in park. Inspect the key for damage. Ensure there is nothing stuck to the key. Check to see if the steering wheel is locked. Wiggle the wheel back and forth while turning the key.
Or create the card shape and size using the heavy cardstock. You only want to use heavy cardstock because even though the buttons are lightweight, they will add some weight to the card--only heavy material can support them. Also, when using hot glue you will need strong material in order to avoid having bleed through the card.; , Instead of just gluing buttons on the card, go into the design with a plan. Consider the overall message (such as “Happy Birthday”) and card size. Also, determine if you plan to create an abstract design or something more traditional, like a birthday cake or balloons.   Sketch the design directly on the card using pencil. Make light sketch marks to use as your guide. You can erase any remaining marks after the card has been completed.       Map out where the buttons will be placed. Obtain a general idea of button placement by laying them along the sketch without gluing them in place. This way you can see what your design might look like without making a commitment.  Use the paint pens or markers before adding the buttons. The buttons will enhance the design so include your message and base design first.   Allow paint or marker to dry on the card before adding the buttons.       Place a small dab of hot glue on the back of the button before applying it to the card. Add glue for each button immediately before it is placed.  You may want to let the card rest overnight to ensure the glue and marker/paint is completely dry.	Fold cardstock in half. Create/plan your design. Create the card design. Allow card ample dry time once the front design has been completed. Finished.
Even after you’ve hit the big screen, it’s important that you improve over the duration of your career. That means learning from other actors, practicing your roles, and understanding screenwriting and characterization.   Method actresses completely embody the role, taking on the personality and life of the character they are playing. This makes the performance more organic.As time changes, acting methods also change. Make sure to stay up on the latest trends and take advice from successful actors an actresses in the industry, even if they’re younger than you.  An easy way for an actress to fade into obscurity is to select poor roles. Don’t rely on your agent to choose things for you and read every script before accepting a role. Refuse roles that may hurt your career in the future. Additionally, don’t take similar roles on in succession or else you may be typecast.   Be realistic with your acting range, and choose roles that you can be capable in.

Taking a couple of years off may mean people forget about you in that duration of time. Stay active and keep working. This may mean putting off relationships, having a family or developing a relationship.   Some actors create bonds with producers or directors and go on to make numerous movies with the same people.  Moving to a city that has more auditioning opportunities available will mean that you’ll have more chances to find work. Keep in mind that this also means that the competition will be tougher in these areas. The best cities for acting include Los Angeles California, Baton Rouge Louisiana, Albuquerque New Mexico, Auckland, Mumbai etc. Research carefully if you are going to invest in relocating.Being around other actresses will also allow you to network in the industry and learn new things. In many acting centric cities the cost of living is higher than average.  Social media has allowed a greater connection between actresses and fans, and is a must if you want to stay relevant today. Make sure to maintain a succinct social media and work with your manager or agent to develop a good strategy. Digital video has also made it easier to come out with custom content, and delivering this to your fans for free will help grow your your fanbase and career.

Move to an acting focused city. Network through social media and YouTube.
Place chocks under the front wheels in both directions to prevent the car from moving.  Start the engine and remove the cover from the steering column. Remove the fuel pump relay fuse under the dash near the steering column. The female clip of the relay is yellow, but the rest of the relay is dark. The engine will stall and depressurize the fuel line to prevent gasoline from spraying when you disconnect the filter., The negative terminal is black, printed with the letters "NEG" and marked by a minus (-) sign., Locate the fuel filter toward the middle, in front of the rear passenger-side wheel, toward the center of the car., Use a cross-tip screwdriver to remove them part way, then gently pull them out. Note the position of the cover so you can easily reattach it.  Place a pan under the filter to catch fuel. , Use a screwdriver to slide the fuel lines off.  Clamp the rubber fuel lines with vise grips to prevent fuel from leaking before you slide the lines off the filter. Don't clamp the metal parts of the lines to avoid damage. Alternatively, plug the line with a pen or golf tee after you remove the rubber hoses. ,,, Reattach the battery terminal., Put the ignition key in the on position, but don't start the car. This will allow the fuel pump to work without turning on the car, and the fuel line will repressurize.  Turn off the key after 15 seconds and pull the wire from the diagnostic connector.  Look on the ground underneath the car for fuel. If you see gas, you have a leak. Review to ensure the filter is correctly installed., Tighten the gas cap.	Drive the rear of the Miata onto ramps. Remove the fuel cap to remove pressure from the fuel line. Disconnect the negative terminal of your battery. Situate yourself under the rear bumper. Remove the Miata fuel filter cover, which is attached with 5 plastic screw clamps.Use a 10 mm (13/32-inch) socket to remove the bolt that secures the clamp holding the fuel filter to the car. Use pliers to loosen the hose clamps attached to the fuel filter.Place the new fuel filter in the bracket and connect both ends of the filter to the rubber fuel-line hoses.Use pliers to tighten the hose clamps.Tighten the bolt on the clamp holding the fuel filter. Plug in the fuel-pump relay fuse and reattach the plastic cover on the steering column. Re-establish pressure in the fuel system by bridging the fuel pump (F/P) terminal to the ground terminal in the diagnostic connector under the hood. Start the car and check the fuel filter for leaks. Replace the fuel filter cover.
If your plants appear healthy and you only want to enrich the soil, then you should buy a balanced organic dry fertilizer containing trace minerals and equal amounts of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. To help suffering or struggling plants, though, you should select a fertilizer that directly addresses your garden's needs.   Check for signs of nutrient deficiencies. The quickest way to determine if your plants lack proper nutrition is to observe how they look. The appearance often gives away many clues about what the plants are lacking. For instance, nitrogen improves foliage growth, so yellowing and browning leaves suggest that your soil needs more nitrogen. Similarly, plants lacking in phosphorus produce little fruit and plants lacking in potassium have weak flowers. Test your soil for deficiencies.If you want to get a more accurate reading of your soil's deficiencies, you should submit a sample of the soil for nutrient testing at an agricultural lab. The lab results will indicate which nutrients were found in high amounts and which are desperately low. Along with an analysis of the soil's quality, many professional tests will also come back with a suggestion on what type of soil you need to look for to improve your soil.; , Boron, Iron, sulfur, manganese, and zinc are good examples of this. For most nutrients, however, you will need to look for components that are naturally high in those nutrients even though it is not obvious by the name.   To add nitrogen to the soil, look for blood meal, cottonseed meal, fish meal, soybean meal, crab meal, corn gluten meal, feather meal, and leather meal. To add phosphorus to the soil, look for components like bone meal and rock phosphate. To add potassium, look for granite meal, greensand, kelp meal, wood ash, Sul-Po-Mag, and sulfate of potash. Dolomitic limestone can add calcium, magnesium, and molybdenum. Epsom salt can add magnesium. In addition to phosphorus, phosphate rock can add calcium and sulfur. Gypsum is another component that can add sulfur, and kelp meal, greensand, and granite meal all contain trace elements that can benefit the soil.  Pre-made blends of dry organic fertilizing components can be found on the market. In each blend, the components are dispersed evenly through the mixture, ensuring that each handful contains roughly the same concentration of nutrients. Each blend also uses different components, however, so it is important that you check the label to find out which components are used.   Check the number on the label. All fertilizers, whether chemical or organic, are labeled with a three-part number that indicates the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively. When buying a pre-mixed dry organic fertilizer, a simple, effective way to determine if it will offer your plants what they need is to check this number. If you need a balanced fertilizer, for instance, you should look for one with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 label. If you need to give your plants a dose of potassium, however, look for a fertilizer with a heavier dose of potassium, like a 0-0-12 fertilizer.  Another way to organically fertilize your garden is to buy dry fertilizer components separately. You can purchase blood meal, kelp meal, and most other dry components separately. Once you have what you need to balance or enrich your soil, you can either combine them together into your own fertilizer blend or apply them separately by digging them into the soil or spreading them at the surface and watering them in.	Know what your soil needs. Research to learn which components offer your plants what they need most.Some organic components are sold by the name of the nutrient they provide. Buy a dry organic fertilizer blend. Consider buying fertilizer components as needed.
Safety is paramount any time you are working on your vehicle. Start by putting on protective eye glasses to protect you from any falling material under the hood of the car, sparks or battery fluid in the event the battery becomes compromised. You may also want to wear gloves. Make sure the area you are working in is well ventilated and lit sufficiently to allow you to see where you are going and what you are working on.Gloves are not necessary but may protect your hands from small pinches and cuts while working on your vehicle. Make sure there are no children in the area while you work on the battery of a vehicle as sparks could fly if positive and negative cables come into contact with one another.; , In order to properly charge your battery, you must first identify the type of battery you have. You can usually find this written somewhere on the battery, but you may need to check the manufacturer's website if the label is too worn to read or missing. You should also find out the voltage of the battery by looking on the battery’s label or by checking in your vehicle owner's manual. Types of batteries include:Wet cell batteries may be serviceable, which means there are things you can do to help improve the charge and the life of your battery. VRLA Batteries (Valve Regulated Lead-Acid Battery) are completely sealed and require no maintenance. These batteries come as Gel Cell or Absorbed Glass Mat batteries and are less common in cars unless purchased as an after-market modification.  Pick a charger that is appropriate for your battery and purposes. Most chargers will work for all types of batteries except Gel Cell batteries. There are fast chargers that can charge your battery quickly or even provide you with a jump start, as well as "trickle" chargers that provide a slow but longer lasting charge. Many newer chargers come with a microprocessor to monitor how much the battery has charged. These digital chargers will then stop the process automatically when the battery is fully charged. Older, simpler chargers must be stopped manually to prevent dangerous overcharging and should not be left alone for extended periods of time while connected.Read the charger's instruction manual to make sure you are using your particular unit correctly. Even new digital chargers should be monitored closely while charging to ensure it functions properly and stops before over-charging the battery.  It’s important to disconnect the battery before conducting any repairs or maintenance on your vehicle. Most of the time you will be able to charge the battery without taking it out of the car, but if reaching the battery or fitting the charging cables in the engine bay or trunk where the battery is located proves difficult, remove the battery from the car completely while you charge it.If you are unsure where your battery is located, check the owner’s manual for your vehicle. Some vehicles have the battery in the trunk, while most have it under the hood. Disconnect the negative terminal first, then the positive when removing a battery.  Any dirt or grime on the battery terminals can prevent the charging cables from establishing a strong connection to the battery, so it’s important to clean the terminals thoroughly. Use baking soda and a wet cloth or a sandpaper pad to wipe away any grime or rust. Make sure the terminals are bare metal before moving on to the next step in order to ensure a strong charge.Sometimes you may find the battery has a solid charge, but dirty terminals were preventing the electricity from flowing. Do not touch the terminals with your bare skin, especially if there is any white powder on them. This powder is usually dried sulfuric acid, and it can burn your skin if you come in contact with it.	Put on the appropriate safety gear. Determine what kind of battery you have. Get a car battery charger. Disconnect and remove the battery from your vehicle if necessary. Clean the battery terminals.
Before you choose a cleaning method, check for care tags attached to your Saffiano bag, jacket, or other product. These care tags often have recommended methods for cleaning Saffiano leather. If present, follow these directions and only use an alternate method if the recommended method proves ineffective., Whether you’re cleaning a handbag, a coat, or some other Saffiano leather product, there is always a chance that the cleaning method you’ve selected does more harm than good. To be sure you won’t damage your Saffiano leather, test your cleaning method of choice by applying it to a section of leather that won’t be visible.For instance, if you’re cleaning a Saffiano leather passport jacket, test your cleaning method on the inside of the jacket rather than the outside, where the area you really want to clean is. When testing, check the surface of your cleaning cloth, sponge, or cotton swab regularly to see if you’re removing any color from the leather. If you are, find an alternate cleaning method.  Baby wipes are perfect for cleaning Saffiano leather for the same reason they are good for cleaning babies: they are gentle and won’t cause damage when applied. You could use baby wipes to clean your Saffiano leather with gentle, circular motions. Alternately, you could rub the baby wipe in one direction across the surface of your Saffiano leather until it is clean., If a baby wipe didn’t quite do the job, you could try soap and water. Mix a few drops of liquid soap with about two cups (240 milliliters) of warm distilled water. Mix them together with a few gentle stirs and dip a sponge or soft hand towel into the water.With your sponge or towel damp (but not soaking wet), gently wipe the leather’s surface. Use a dry sponge or hand towel to remove any excess liquid once you’ve cleaned the leather to your satisfaction. Do not use tap water. The chlorine content could damage your Saffiano leather.  If both baby wipes and soapy water have failed, try to clean your Saffiano leather with a baking soda mixture. Mix one tablespoon of baking soda with ½ cup (120 milliliters) water. Dip a hand towel or dry cloth into the mixture and gently rub the spot you wish to clean in a circular motion, or wipe the area with continuous wipes in one direction.	Check care tags before getting started. Test the cleaning procedure on a less visible area. Use a baby wipe. Mix soap and water. Apply water and baking soda.
The little dog pattern piece leaves a hole in the stomach for you to turn your animal inside out, but you might need to leave your own hole if you are making a different felt animal.  Using the whole you left stuff your animal thoroughly with polyester fiberfill. Make sure the animal is well stuffed but not over stuffed. You want the animal to feel firm without looking like it is going to explode. Use your judgment. , You can add whatever pieces you want. The little dog calls for small beads for eyes and some black string for the mouth and nose. You can add designs all over the felt if you desire though.   The snake embroidery would consist of little sewing on black circles of fabric or string for eyes, and a little piece of red felt for the tongue. Draw a tongue that appeals to you. Most snakes have forked tongues.  This would be the time to add ears, tails, or whatever else your animal might have connected to their body. The little dog will have a tail stitched to the back of his body and two ears connected on top. Remember to turn your body pieces inside out after you sew them to hide the stitching. Follow the letters on your design piece. If you aren’t sure what pieces are added where, look at which letters correspond to what pieces. For example if you are adding ears to the top of a dog there will be the same letter on the ears as on the top of the body piece. Anywhere with matching letters is supposed to be connected with stitching.	Turn your animal inside out. Stuff your animal. Add your embroidery. Stich up your final body pieces.
This is really simple but it makes a lot of difference between cars that are stolen and those that are not. When parking the vehicle, make sure that it is in a legal parking zone, to guard against thieves who impersonate council askaris (traffic wardens) to steal vehicles by towing.; , Many vehicle thefts start as crimes of opportunity to steal valuables inside the car; such as car stereos, laptops or any visible cash or jewelry. By keeping this things safely hidden away you can prevent many would-be thieves from even taking a second look at your car.  While parking the car facing your gate makes it easy for you to drive out in the morning, it also makes it easy for thieves to escape with the vehicle. Forcing the thief to reverse the car out if they are trying to steal it, makes it a bit harder for them and can give you those extra precious minutes to alert for help.  A nice loud honk of your horn can intimidate would be carjackers and bright lights can also attract attention to others thus reducing the attractiveness of stealing your car. Regular check-ups to your garage can make sure that these remain in good working order.  Sometimes despite your best efforts your vehicle will still get stolen. The panic that usually follows a car theft is accompanied by regrets of things you could have done to prevent it. By installing the Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) device from suppliers such as Carzone you will never have any regrets.	Park in a legal zone. Do not leave valuables visible in the car. Do not park the car facing the gate. Keep your horn and lights in good working condition. Install an Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) Device.
Your legs should look like a number 4.   This is a move that requires a lot of flexibility and strength. Do not attempt the pin drop if you are new to dance or are prone to ankle sprains. Many jerk dancers do multiple pin drops in quick succession between periods of doing the reject. The more pin drops you do at once, the more difficult it becomes to right yourself as you get dizzier. A dance with a lot of quick pin drops in a row is very impressive.  Control your fall so you don't go too fast. Remember that your aim is to appear to fall while actually lowering yourself to the ground with your leg muscles. Getting this step right takes a lot of practice.  You should land mainly on your right foot with your left knee in front of it. Timing your fall so that your foot lands flat will keep you from bruising your knee. Feel free to use your hands for balance., Use your right foot to push yourself. Twist a little and corkscrew clockwise as you stand. You can follow this move by mirroring it, starting out on the opposite leg.	Stand straight on your left leg and cross your right foot behind your left knee. Bend your left knee and drop towards your left side. Hit the ground. Stand back up.
Printing things from the Internet and putting them in your carry on isn't that bad an idea. Since you are probably under 13, you sometimes get a little bag filled with goodies like a pack of cards, so that probably would also have little puzzles.; , In your carry on, pack the essentials. iPods, Nintendo DS, a companion (yes, we all have one, whether it's a blanket, Mr. Snuggles or Suzy), wet wipes, a good book, gum, a light jumper, capris and items you printed off the Internet earlier. Put all of it in a small library bag or backpack.  A clean shirt and clean pants will be good enough. Make it loose and long, plane seats rub the skin raw on your legs, and you can change in the bathroom on the plane to your capris if you get too hot.  This is great for last minute snacks at the airport or a mad libs book. ,,	Print. Pack. Dress well. Pack about 15 dollars worth of the other country's currency in your carry on and 15 of yours. Pack some small, cheap toys in your carry on and give them to any whiny toddlers who are annoying you and all other passengers on the plane.  , Try to spend as long as you can only using your imagination as a guide for fun.  , Keep doing this pattern: Puzzles, 1 chapter of book, In flight screen on the back of the seat, Nintendo DS, walk down the aisle.
Line the bottom or entire bottle with sparkle by choosing something clear or glistening. Make sure the items can easily fit through the mouth of the bottle.  For a more rugged appearance, rocks, stones or pebbles provide an authentic country house or farmhouse theme. Choose ones with interesting shapes, textures and colors.  Before you add your flowering flourish, consider enhancing the bottle with separate petals or greenery.   Consider using silk or artificial flowers/petals/stems instead of real plants if you plan to use the bottle centerpiece for more than one evening.  Another way to add interest is to drop chunks of lemon, mango or even small pieces of broccoli inside the bottle., Red Hots or any other small hard candies would suffice.   To match a holiday theme, one example would be to drop broken candy canes inside the bottle for a festive touch.  Don’t forget to add small shell pieces as well.	Add sparkly marbles, rocks or jewels. Line the bottle with rustic looking stones or rocks. Drop greenery or flower petals inside the vase. Fill with slices of fruit or vegetables. Place candy inside the bottle. Line the bottle with sand for a beach focused centerpiece.
If you're hiring workers to help, you need to know how much you'll pay them. If you're painting for someone else, you need to know how much is fair to charge them. One to two painters can usually paint 2,500 square feet in one to two days. It usually costs around $800 a day.For a small room, such as the 650 square foot example, it should only take a few hours. Divide 650 by 2,500 to get roughly .25. This means you will probably only pay a quarter of the cost of a full day's worth of work, meaning the paint job will be roughly $200.  If there is a lot of furniture to move or if you're painting with different colors, this will tack on extra time. If you believe the job will require extra labor, tack on some extra money. For example, if you're painting your 650 square foot room two different colors, add $100 on to the labor costs. This brings labor costs to $300., Unfortunately, paint jobs do not always go as planned. Parts of a home may become damaged, paint may spill, and so on. It's a good idea to give yourself a little wiggle room. You can give consumers an estimate roughly $50 to $100 higher in case of an accident., After you have all the individual costs calculated, add them together to get a rough estimate. In the 650 square foot example, the estimate would come to around $535. In case of accidents, you can quote about $635., If you're hiring painters, it's not always a good idea to try to calculate costs yourself. Get a quote from several different companies, explaining your needs and the size of your home. This will give you a more accurate price and help you budget for a paint job.	Factor in the basic cost of labor. Think about anything that could lengthen painting time. Account for potential accidents. Calculate the total cost. Ask for a professional estimate.
For everyday practical purposes, decibels are usually seen as a simple measure of loudness. However, the truth is a little more complex. In physics, decibels are often thought of as a convenient way of expressing the intensity of a sound wave. The larger the amplitude of a given sound wave, the more energy it transmits, the more it moves the air particles in its path, and the more "intense" the sound is.Because of this direct relationship between a sound wave intensity and and its volume in decibels, it's possible to find a decibel value given nothing more than an intensity level for the sound (which is typically measured in watts/square meter)   Note that, for ordinary sounds, the intensity value is usually very small. For instance, a sound with an intensity of 5 ×10-5 (or 0.00005) watts/square meter translates to about 80 decibels — about the volume of a blender or food processor. To better understand the relationship between intensity measurements and decibels, let's follow along with an example problem. For the purposes of this problem, let's say that we're music producers and we're trying to find the background noise level in our recording studio to improve the sound of our records. After setting up our equipment, we detect a background noise intensity of 1 × 10-11 (0.00000000001) watts/square meter . In the next few steps, we'll use this info to find the decibel level of the background noise in our studio.  Once you've found the intensity of your sound, you can simply plug it into the formula 10Log10(I/10-12) (where "I" is your intensity in watts/square meter) to find its decibel value. To begin, divide by 10-12 (0.000000000001). 10-12 represents the intensity of a 0 decibel sound, so by comparing your intensity value to this, you're essentially finding its relationship to this base value.   In our example, we'd divide our intensity value, 10-11, by 10-12 to get 10-11/10-12 = 10.  To finish solving, all you need to do is take the base 10 logarithm of your answer, then, finally, multiply by 10. This accounts for the fact that decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10 — in other words, an increase of 10 decibels means that the loudness of the sound has doubled.   Our example is easy to solve. Log10(10) = 1. 1 ×10 = 10. Therefore, the background noise in our studio has a loudness of 10 decibels. This is quite quiet, but still detectable with our high-quality recording equipment, so we'll probably need to eliminate the source of the noise for the best recordings  , As noted above, decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10. For any given decibel value, a noise 10 decibels greater is twice as loud, a noise 20 decibels greater is 4 times as loud, and so on. This makes it easy to describe the huge range of sound intensities that can be picked up by the human ear. The loudest sound the ear can hear without experiencing pain is more than one billion times more intense than the quietest noise it can detect.By using decibels, we avoid having to use huge numbers to describe common sounds — instead, we only need to use three digit numbers at most.   Consider this — which is easier to use: 55 decibels or 3 × 10-7 watts/square meter? The two are equivalent, so rather than having to use scientific notation (or a very small decimal), decibels allow for us to use a sort of simple shorthand for easy everyday use.	Find your sound's intensity in watts/square meter. Divide by 10-12. Take the Log10 of your answer and multiply by 10. Understand the logarithmic nature of decibel values.
Water is the most important supply you need to have.At least one gallon of water per person & per day. That is just for drinking, that doesn't include water for cooking and washing.; ,   It is wise to have at least two weeks of medication on hand. A good amount is at least a month’s worth. You can get a good first aid kit with most of your basic needs at most pharmacies. Get a larger size one. Also pick up extra items for it like anti-biotic ointment, and antiseptic wipes. Infection will be an issue. If you deal with a minor scratch properly,it will save your life. Most of these first aid kits come with instructions for basic first aid so you need to read that.If it doesn’t, buy a book on Basic First aid. Don’t count on home remedies. Be sure to have dried and canned foods. During a storm everyone runs out and buys all the milk, bread and eggs off the shelves. Milk and eggs will go bad in just a day or two without refrigeration. During bad storms,the power is going to go out. Though your fridge and freezer are built to keep things cold, they will thaw a lot sooner than you think. Dried foods such as pasta,cereal,breakfast bars,and powdered milk are the kinds of things you want to have handy. Remember it isn’t about whether or not you like it, it is all about survival. Canned foods, such as soups, tuna, vegetables and canned meats. Again, Franks and Beans may not be your favorite food, but it is a great source of nutrients that your body needs to survive.    Great! How much fuel do you have? Do you have all the spare parts and knowledge to repair it when it doesn’t start for you? Maybe, but there are too many things that could render it useless. Prepare for the “Dark Ages”. Have a way to prepare food because no power,no way of making food like we usually do. Though it may be difficult,you have to you can eat the canned goods right from the can. The dried goods are a different story. Most of them need to have hot water to be prepared properly. Be ready to camp.Whether you like camping or not, you should have some basic camping gear handy. A camp stove is a great investment. They are relatively inexpensive and can be stored long term and used when needed. Remember to have the fuel available. Your BBQ will work well for this as well. Just don’t try to use it indoors! Make sure you have enough fuel for whichever method you choose. A “Mess Kit” is a great thing to have handy. If this event turns out to be more than 2 weeks, it is portable and designed to be used on open camp fires. (Your household pots and pans often have plastic or weak metals that would break down or melt over an open fire) Be sure to have an Information source and a means to listen to it. Have a hand crank radio ready to go. In most cases there are enough radio stations that are prepared and able to keep broadcasting in the event of an emergence. They will help you stay informed as to what is going on around you and whether or not you have to plan to go to plan “B”. They will supply you with locations of refuge, supplies, and conditions around you. This is a MUST HAVE. If you have a battery powered radio, you need at least 3 sets of FRESH batteries for it. Fresh means, new every year. Batteries do loos their charge while sitting on the shelf and may not last very long when you do start using them. Have a way to pass time. Your tech device is not going to run for very long, and there will more than likely be internet service.Texting and cell phone use will be limited if available at all. Have plenty of old fashioned games on hand to help keep you and your loved ones entertained. Just sitting around waiting will literally drive you crazy. You will start making bad decisions because you are “Tired of waiting”. Have a Light source, preferably a safe one. This is where things can get dangerous. One of the most popular light sources are candles. These are probably the most dangerous because of the fire hazard involved. Only use them if you absolutely have to. Use them in candle holders that are enclosed, and keep them away from combustibles. (Curtains, paper, table cloths, furniture.) Flashlights are your best option. They also have “Crank” flashlights usually right next to the crank radios. IF you are going to get battery operated flash lights, then be sure to have plenty of extra batteries on hand for them too. Use them sparingly. Plan your days around daylight. Go to bed when it gets dark and get up when it is light. Another option I use is oil lamps or kerosene lamps. Again they are a fire hazard so you have to be EXTREMELY careful with these. Have plenty of extra fuel on hand for these as well. Be prepared to move. Depending on the event, you need to be ready to move. Weather they give an evacuation notice, or this event turns into a long term catastrophic event. You need to be ready to take what you can carry and go.	Be sure to have portable (Drinkable) water. Be sure to have all of the medications and medical supplies that you might need.If you have the elderly living with you,make sure you have their needs. If you have a generator, be sure you have what it needs.
Choose a fabric that reflects your personal taste and matches the outfit (or various clothes) that you intend to wear the clip with. The fabric should be substantial enough to withstand cutting and assembling into a flower, which should be fine for most fabric types. When choosing, consider repurposing fabric from an item that's no longer needed, such as a favorite old skirt that had a lovely print or a linen you've cherished but that has since formed holes here and there (obviously, avoid the bits with the holes). About a ¼ of a yard (23cm) of fabric should suffice but it helps to have more so that you can make more than one clip (to share, cover your hair, whatever).   The fabric must be tolerant of heat, so that you can apply the hot glue gun to the edges to prevent fraying. Consider mixing and matching fabrics. Since you’ll be creating a unique flower, you don’t have to create the bloom completely from one fabric.; , Then, using a water glass, water bottle, keychain or similar circular guide, trace up to five circles on the cardboard in various sizes (four or five is an arbitrary but sound number––the amount of layers is entirely up to you––just don't overdo them). The different sizes are important to give the impression of varied petal sizes. Keep each circle as perfectly round as possible. Cut out the cardboard circle patterns.   If you have a mathematical compass ,you may have an easier time creating different circles. If not, find various household items to do the job.  Using a light pencil or fabric pencil, trace the circles onto the back of the fabric. If the pencil marking is likely to show through, use an invisible fabric marker, the kind that fades after a few days. Once traced out, cut out each circle carefully using sharp, fabric-only scissors. Sharp scissors help to reduce fraying or fringing.  Use very sharp, fabric-only scissors again and keep your hand steady when cutting.   Eye each circle and figure out where to make five even cuts. If you can't keep the spacing in your mind's eye, mark the tip of each line to be cut before starting. Cut three quarters from the circle edge toward the center. Don't cut all the way to the middle––imagine leaving a large intact middle circle in place and only cut three quarters of the way to its edge.  Using the sharp scissors, carefully shape rounded edges for each petal (five on each circle). Nature is imperfect, so some of your rounding can be too!  , There are a few ways you can do this, ranging from easy and safe, to a little more challenging and possibly flammable:   Purchase like-colored puffy fabric pens and draw over the edges of each flower petal. This will create a look of volume and may even add a little sparkle (some pens come with glitter or sparkle). Hot glue the edges of each flower. This will seal and possibly add dimension to the flower. This may be slightly tedious as you may have to hold each flower on an angle to apply the glue without having it stick to something (like the table or another item). Lay on a cookie sheet covered in wax paper to dry. Melt candle wax over the edges to make them curl slightly. This can be a little dangerous and should be done only by a responsible adult. It should be done somewhere free of flammable material. Light a candle and then hold one petal close to the flame (without actually placing it in the flame). Roll the edges and the heat will create a funky, curled edge. Do not attempt this with fabric liable to flare up––if in doubt, skip!  , Stack the flower petals on top of each other, placing the largest on the bottom through to the smallest on top.   Vary the placement of the flower pieces so that you can see different petal sections from each, individually created flower. In other words, avoid simply arranging them exactly one on top of the other.  Thread a strong needle with thread that is the same color as your flower. Begin sewing from the bottom up (so that the knot stays on the bottom of the flower) and sew together in the center of the flower stack.   Choose a needle able to handle the fabric and the fact that it is thicker once stacked.  Once the flower has been sewn together, you can decorate it further if wished. For example, glue a costume jewel in the center or add glitter glue over the petals. Other additions include sequins, buttons and little pieces of lace or ribbon.   Most items should attach easily with hot glue suitable for fabric. However, if you'd rather attach an item by sewing, this might prove sturdier in the long run. Keep in mind the weight of any added adornments; less is usually best.  Glue the flower to the hair clip and consider reinforcing it with thread, if needed.   Add a few dabs of hot glue to the bottom of the flower and then place on top of the hair clip. Consider opening the clip during the application phase so you don’t glue the clip together. If possible, stitch the bottom of the flower to the clip for extra durability. This type of reinforcement is good for longevity and durability, and is recommended if a small child is to wear the clip.  Make any adjustments if needed, such as snipping off loose threads, etc. It's time to try it on!	Select your fabric. Create a flower petal pattern out of cardboard.Take a flimsy cardboard, as you’ll be tracing and cutting circles from the cardboard to be used as your fabric pattern––cereal packaging is ideal. Trace out the circles using the cardboard patterns. Create the petal formation for each circle. Round the edges of each distinct petal. Add three-dimensional details to the petals. Piece the flower together. Sew the flower into place. Add beading or sparkle to your flower. Attach the flower to the hair clip. Done.
Hedges that have recently been planted, such as within the previous two months, require only generalized shaping. Use a large pair of pruning shears to cut the hedges down to a height of approximately 6 inches (15.24 centimeters). Don't worry about making sure that the tops of the hedges are perfectly aligned at this time, just that they have been adequately trimmed.; ,   This can be done simply by using a yardstick or measuring tape. Determine the distance from the base of the hedges to their highest point.    In the spring following the first year of growth by the hedges, greater amounts of shaping must be done. Review the height of the plants, and trim them down to half their current size. This can be done without focusing a great deal on symmetry. Make sure that this process has been completed before the hedges begin blossoming. In addition, during the second year of growth, the sides of the hedges can be shaped lightly. Using a large pair of shears, trim growth that is sticking out from the sides of the hedge. Focus most of your attention to especially deviant branches and leaves, being carefully to avoid performing excessive amounts of trimming.    At the start of the third growing season, repeat the process described above, trimming the hedges to half their starting height. Greater amounts of shaping on the sides of the hedges may be required at this time.	Shape lightly during the first few months of growth. At the end of the first growing season, measure the total height of the hedges. Shape the hedges at the start of the second growing season. Prepare the hedges for their third growing season.
A fake fight scene requires real coordination. To make a convincing fight scene you need actors that can fight convincingly. Whether you're filming a one-on-one duel or a big brawl, you want actors who can carry themselves with fluidity and coordination.   If your actors aren't comfortable moving a lot, you can still give them smaller parts in the fight. It will make your job much harder, however. Fake fighting is closer to dancing than actual brawling, and requires a similar level of coordination and athleticism.; , Do you want a blazing fast kung-fu battle or a slow, intense brawl? Will the fight be one-sided or will the combatants be evenly matched? Maybe one character is getting beaten up badly, but comes behind at the very end to win. Whatever your film, figure out the feel and progression of the fight before you start choreographing it.   How does each fighter behave? A noble warrior, for example, will fight very differently from a scoundrel pirate. Do you want gritty, realistic violence or something more fun and cartoonish? How serious is this fight? If you're not making the movie alone, show your cast and crew fight scenes from 3-4 movies you want your scene to look like. This helps everyone get on the same page., This is non-negotiable -- any closer and you risk real injury, any further and the hit will look unconvincing. Say Kim needs to kick at Ron's head. There are two ways to play it. First, Kim can kick in front of Ron's face, arching her foot in front of his nose. Second, she can kick past his head, flying past his ear.   A third method is to let Ron dodge the blow, which is much easier to shoot than fake contact because you don't need to "cheat" the impact of the kick., If Kim is throwing that kick Ron needs to realistically get hit by it. As the kick passes his head, Ron should launch himself in the same direction, mimicking the contact. Take it at 50% speed at first so that both actors know exactly what is happening and where they need to go, then slowly ratchet up the speed with each rehearsal.   Let each blow land where an actor just was for the best results. If Kim throws a punch, have Ron back up as he reacts to it, helping sell the movement., Say Kim needs to throw Ron to the floor for the scene. Kim wouldn't ever actually throw Ron. Instead, she would just grab Ron, who would then throw himself to the floor. Kim would simply fake the throw by following Ron's lead. This makes the timing much more fluid and far safer, and should be used in a variety of scenarios:   Say Kim grabs Ron's hand and breaks his arm at the elbow. All Kim should do is grab the hand, letting Ron move himself to the floor as she follows him down. If Kim needs to slam Ron's head against the wall, Ron should throw his head within six inches of the wall and fake the bounce back up. She simply follows his head with her hand.  Never use a real weapon on set, even if it is supposed to be just seen in the background. Props should always be harmless and completely safe. In professional movies, prop masters must be professionally firearm trained, even with blanks and fake guns, and for a good reason -- even blanks have caused injury when played with or used inappropriately.   You can purchase realistic foam baseball bats, swords, nunchucks, and much more online from movie prop websites. Prop knives should be retractable, meaning they hide when you "stab" someone. Guns, even rubber ones, should be covered with a bright muzzle indicating that they are fake whenever they are not in use.  For example, say your scene starts with traded punches, moves to a dodged kick, and ends with Kim throwing Ron to the ground. You should master the punches, the kick, and the throw individually, then slowly piece them together. When choreographing scenes, go slowly, taking it one piece at a time to ensure perfection and safety., Think back to the tone of your fight, and the attitudes of your characters. For example, a noble and experienced warrior will be calm and confident. When not fighting they will be poised and still. A less experienced fighter, however, is generally jittery and nervous. They make big, energetic movements, bounce or shake when not in action, etc. Once your actual action is choreographed, spend some time making the fight look artistic.   Make sure you rehearse in costume as well. Actors need to practice in the clothes they will actually have to fight in.	Find physical, athletic actors to work with. Decide on the tone and arc of the fight. Keep all punches and kicks 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) away from the actors. Coordinate the reaction to each hit to time it up with the action. Let the person getting hit dictate any actual movement. Purchase safe, movie-specific props. Practice each action individually before stringing it all together. Add flourishes and details once the main actions are perfected.
While checking, also look for the ratings level, to be sure whatever you do choose to go and see is age appropriate for everyone in your party.   Read the reviews to see what others have said. Read both what the professional critics say, and what the movie-going public has said. You can decide for yourself whether or not the movie is going to be worth the effort.; , If going alone, this should be easy but if going with others, confer first and get agreement. If you've gone to the trouble of reading the reviews, give a precis of the reviews so that you can be persuasive about your choice of movie.   Consider booking tickets for the movie online. This can save time in having to line up and it can also save money sometimes.  Make a meeting place there and a time too. Make sure it's a few minutes before it's time to go in, or longer if you need to buy tickets and treats.  Cinema treats are often quite pricey, so if you want to save money, take your own. You could even stop at a supermarket or convenience store on the way and purchase chips, candies and drinks before you arrive. Place them in a shopping bag that is opaque––there is no need to advertise you're being budget savvy!   Buying on premises has the advantage of letting you get fresh popcorn or ice creams. If you want to have water, it can be helpful to take along your water bottle and refill if needed; buying bottled water can be a pricey thing at the cinema. If you don't want food, a few peppermints or chewing gum might be a nice stand-by in case you do get the munchies during the movie. Just seeing and hearing others eating around you can make you feel hungry too.  If you know the cinema is air-conditioned, it can be helpful to have a jacket, hoodie or cardigan in case you get too cold.  It can be useful for the light if the cinema is too dark to find your seat, and it can be used to play games or listen to music while waiting for the movie to play. Remember to turn it off when the movie starts.  Needing to go in the middle of the movie will  ,	Check the internet for what movies are showing in your area right now. Select the movie you're going to see. Let your friends know which movie theater to go to if they don't already know. Decide whether you'll buy treats at the cinema or bring your own. Bring something warm if you get cold in air-conditioned buildings. Bring your smartphone. Go to the bathroom before the movie. Enjoy your movie.
There are many computer animation programs you can use online, with prices varying from very inexpensive to more expensive. Many programs do not require extensive knowledge about computer animation and are designed to help beginners learn how to make their own cartoon movies. You can also design your characters and add props to shots with a few clicks of a mouse, making it easy and fast to build your movie.   A list of the top seven computer animation programs can be found here: http://www.freemake.com/blog/5-best-sites-to-make-animated-video-trouble-free/. They are rated based on their accessibility, their price, and their range of options.  You can use the computer animation program to design each character in your cartoon and any props you may need for your movie. Many programs will provide models that you can edit and add to, adjusting them to fit the look of your characters.   Most programs come with a library of props that you can access for your movie. You may also be able to build your own props if it is not a very common or well known prop, i.e. a magic wand or a special sword.  Most computer animation programs come with several standard settings that you can use for your movie. Once you have designed your characters and props, you can start to place them in the settings to see how they look.   If you are making a movie about a boy wizard in medieval times, for example, you may choose a castle setting or a rural farm setting. You may then place your boy wizard in the setting with props like a magic wand, a sorcerer's hat, and maybe even a fire breathing dragon.  Use your carefully drawn storyboards as a guide for animating the movie. Focus on creating the movie one scene at a time, moving your characters and props in different settings within the computer animation program.   Once you finish animating the rough cut of the movie, you should watch it from beginning to end, noting any scenes that appear underdeveloped or confusing and checking that the pace of the movie is appropriate to the content. If you are making an action packed movie about a boy wizard and his quest to save the world, for example, the pace should be brisk and quick. If you are making a mode meditative film on the death of the family pet, the pace of the movie may be a bit slower and drawn out.	Use a computer animation program. Design your characters and props. Place the characters and props in the settings provided by the computer program. Animate the movie based on your storyboards.
The following steps are for the lead. The follower will mirror these movements. You can also dance with the followers back against the lead’s front, hands joined, and take the same steps.  With your weight starting on your right foot, take two small steps to the left.  Take two small steps to bring you back to the starting point.  Place your left foot just behind you or to the side, rock your weight back onto it and then forward again, replace your foot at the center position.  Repeat the two steps to the left, to steps to the right, rockstep rhythm. This is the basic East Coast Swing.  Since swing is meant to be done with a great deal of space around dancers, you can take traveling steps to move around your section of the dance floor. There is little established pattern, although a star or diamond shape is a good way to start. Move in whatever way feels natural to you.  You can add basic flourishes to this dance. One way is to push distance between partners as you take your rockstep, returning together as you return to starting position. Another way is to spin your partner, either outward or under your arm, as the first two steps are taken, returning on the second two steps.	Understand the two parts. Take two steps to the left. Take two steps to the right. Rock step. Repeat. Take traveling steps. Add flourishes.
If you don't own any, purchase disposable paper overalls with long sleeves. These are usually available from hardware stores. Alternatively, wear your own cloth overalls with either long-sleeves, or wear a long-sleeved top underneath if yours isn't long-sleeved.; , The gloves protect your hands from everything you will be touching, be it dust, dirt, or fibers. Wearing socks and closed shoes or boots is vital - this is no job for open footwear.  Tape the overalls to your socks and to your gloves. Tape around your neck to the t-shirt (you'll probably need help).  You might need to tape this to the shirt or overalls too, depends how hard doing this is.  Add a cap to protect your scalp.  It is a good idea to change in the laundry to prevent walking fibers around the house. If you have to walk through the house to get to the laundry, change where it is least likely to leave fibers in the house and put the clothes in a bucket to take to the laundry.	Wear overalls. Wear gloves and socks. Tape up all opening gaps. Wear a cotton scarf or bandanna around your neck. Wear safety glasses and a dust mask. Wash all clothes thoroughly after use.
These include:   Yarn (pink or purple traditionally, but you can make your pygmy puff any color you want) Scissors Googly eyes or paper and markers Medium or large glue dots Red or pink embroidery thread and plastic needle (optional); , The looser you wrap the yarn, the fluffier and less dense it becomes. A medium density is best because the pygmy puff is firm enough to stand on its own but is still plush and soft. You will wad up some yarn to start, then continue to wrap the yarn around to build it up. Make sure that the pygmy puff looks circular; wrap the yarn repeatedly over an area that bulges to make it look more normal.  Choose the flattest side of your pygmy puff and make sure the pygmy puff can sit without falling over. Choose googly eyes that aren't too large or small. Attach to the face with glue dots roughly the size of the googly eyes. If you don't have googly eyes, draw eyes on a piece of paper, then cut out and attach. Draw the iris first (the colored part), then the pupil (black), and add a dot with a silver sharpie to imitate light reflecting off the eye. Attach to the pygmy puff with glue dots.  Pygmy puffs have long, skinny tongues that they use to scavenge for food. You can make your tongue as short as 3 inches or as long as 8 inches. Cut your desired length from either red or pink embroidery thread and make a large knot on one end. Thread the other end through a plastic needle. Push the needle through the center of the pygmy puff, making sure it comes out in a spot you like. Remove the needle from the thread and pull all of the embroidery thread through.   If the tongue is too long, shorten it. To retract the tongue, pull the knot in the back. To lengthen the tongue, pull the thread in the front.	Gather your materials. Make the body of the pygmy puff. Add eyes to your pygmy puff. Add a tongue, if desired.
If the script is a template for how a movie will sound, storyboard are the template for how they look. Storyboards are how you visualize how actors, props, backgrounds & camera angles will fit together in any particular scene or sequence of shots. It is your chance to visually map out the film before expensive cameras, actors, and crews are waiting around on set.   That said, one of the jobs of a storyboarder is to take the script and improve on it by adding visuals. You must know the full arc of the story before you get started.; , Once you've written your script and have an idea of what will happen in your movie, get yourself some paper or poster board to assemble your storyboard on. Like a comic strip, each square represents a shot or scene and the space underneath is where you fill in the dialogue, notes, or action.   While you can draw your own boards, there are many free templates online that you can print out to start sketching immediately.  The most important function of the storyboard is to show how the shot is going to look. For your first board, you'll want all the essential details so that people reading it know where they are. When wondering what to include, always ask the question: "is this essential to understanding the scene?"   Anytime you change locations you need to draw in a new the background. Remember, you're telling the story visually. Try to imagine what you would need to see if this were a movie. If the background doesn't change between shots, you can leave it blank and focus on the action.  For example, if you want one character to punch another , you don't need to draw five frames of his fist moving slowly towards a face. Instead, draw one frame of the fist with an arrow indicating the movement.   You can also use arrows to indicate camera movements, such as pans or tilts.  Remember, you're basically making a comic book version of the movie, so you should add essential sound effects as well. Don't worry if it doesn't all fit -- you're just giving markers to the director and crew about where the sound is matched up, so ellipses ("...") can help.  Whenever something happens, it needs it's own box. If you're drawing out a conversation, you'll want to switch from one character to another as they talk, as well as some shots of both of them at the same time. You need to draw each one of these shifts individually.   You cannot just draw 1-2 boxes and say "alternate shots" for a conversation. Imagine a scene where a mother is mad at her son for breaking a lamp. Showing the whole thing from the sad or scared son is a very different scene from showing the furious mom the whole time, cutting back and forth, or showing the broken lamp.  If a scene requires a little fake blood, then make a note of it either using a red pen or jotting it down. If the shot requires a long, continuous take, use arrows to indicate how it all flows together. While there are proper terms for all of this, the most important thing is visually telling the story however you can. If it makes sense as a guide to filming, put it in.   If the camera isn't cutting, but lots of things are happening, you can use multiple boxes for one "cut." Whenever something happens, you need a new box, even if the camera doesn't move.	Complete your script before getting started on the storyboards. Draw squares for each scene, leaving room for dialogue underneath. Establish the location, and any important objects, in your first box of the scene. Use arrows and notes to show any movement or changes. Fill in the scene's dialogue and sounds underneath the drawing. Make a new frame for each significant action or camera motion. Fill in essential notes about movement, sounds, or special effects.
When gazing up at the sky, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the number of stars. Narrow your view to just the stars you can see when facing south. This southern sky is where you will find the sea goat, Capricornus., The direction of the Capricornus also changes if you live in the southern hemisphere. In this case, you would look to the northern sky, not the southern sky. Again, it helps to ignore the rest of the sky if you are looking for just one constellation., The sea is in the southern portion of the sky (northern from the southern hemisphere). It is home to several water-related constellations, such as Aquarius, Pisces, and Cetus. Knowing this area and these constellations can help you find Capricornus.If you are familiar with the Summer Triangle constellation, you can draw a straight line from one of it’s points (the star Vega), through a second point (the star Altair) and straight to Capricornus.	Look to the south in the northern hemisphere. Set your gaze north from the southern hemisphere. Familiarize yourself with ‘the sea.’ Capricornus is found in the part of the sky called the sea.
The best type of carton to use is the cardboard kind. It soaks up paint much better. You can try using the foam kind, but the paint may not stick as well.          Make sure that you cut the cups apart so that they are two separate pieces. Trim the edges so that they are nice and smooth. You want a nice round shape.; , Set the cups down, side by side, with the inside facing up. Fold a strip of masking tape over the edges where the cups are touching. This tape will act as a hinge.          For extra security, close the cups, and add a strip of tape on the outside. Make sure that it's on the same side as the inside tape. You want to be able to open and close your chick., Hold the cups from the inside, with the hinge resting loosely between your thumb and forefinger. Apply a coat of yellow acrylic or tempera paint. Make sure that you get the paint inside the crease between the two cups as well.  If the color looks dull or dark, you may need to apply another coat or two of paint. Let the coat dry before applying the next one., You don't have to do this, but it will give them a nicer finish. You can use the same color as you did for the outside, or a different color. If you plan on filling the chick with candy, try to use a non-toxic paint.Most children's paints are, but double-check the label to make sure.  You can use construction paper or cardstock. You can also paint plain paper orange/yellow on both sides, and use that instead.  Make the beaks a little bit taller than you want them to be. This will allow you to attach them to the chick. The triangles should be the same size, and no larger than the bottom of your egg cups.  The triangles can be the same size as the beak, or a little bit bigger. Again, make the wings a little bit longer than you want them to be, so that you can attach them to the chick.  Chicks have three toes, so draw something that looks like three skinny triangles attached together at the base. You will need two pieces. Make sure that they are smaller than the base of your egg carton cup.  Don't worry about folding the bottom edges to make a hinge.  Close the chick and glue the feet to the bottom cup. Make sure that the toes are pointing away from the hinge, and that they are sticking out from under the chick.          The hinge will be on the back of the chick.  Set the chick down on the table so that the inside hinge is facing up. Turn the cups so that one cup is facing you and the other is facing away from you.  Draw a line of glue along the bottom edges of the orange triangles. Press the triangles against the inside top and bottom edges of the egg cups. The beaks should be parallel to the hinge.  This is the cup that has the feet attached. The upper cup should only have the beak piece attached.  When you glued the beak and wing pieces down, they were sticking straight up. This is not very chick-like, so fold them down over the edges of the egg cup. Don't worry if they stick out a little.  Close the chick and turn it so that the beak is facing you. Use a black marker to draw two dots on the top cup, right above the beak.You can also glue on two tiny googly eyes instead.  You can also turn it into a mini Easter basket by stuffing the bottom cup with Easter grass, and placing a few chocolate eggs on top.  Set the chick down so that its feet are planted on the floor. You can adjust the beak and wing pieces as well, so that they stick up or down.	Cut two cups from an egg carton. Tape the cups together along one edge. Paint the outside of the cups. Let the paint dry. Consider painting the inside of the chicks. Get some orange and yellow paper. Cut two triangle shapes out of orange paper for the beak. Cut two triangle shapes out of yellow paper for the wings. Draw feet shapes onto orange paper. Cut the feet shapes out. Glue the feet to the bottom of your chick. Open the chick back up. Glue the beak pieces to the top and bottom cups. Glue the wings in a similar fashion to the sides of the bottom cup. Fold the beak and wings down. Add some eyes to the top cup. Fill the chick with candy, if desired. Close the chick.
It’s important in this digital age to have a website for your band where record producers and fans can learn more about you and hear clips of your music.If possible, use your band's name as the url for your website. For example, if your band's name is Funky Blue Cats, you should make your website www.funkybluecats.com. It’s a good idea to have your music for sale on your website. You can sell mp3 downloads or CDs to ship to fans. If your band's name is already being used as a website, consider changing your name so you can get the url with your band's name. Put your website on all promotional material to drive traffic to your site. The more unique visitors you get to your website, the higher up on search engines your site will be.  In addition to a website, you should use social media and other websites to promote your band. This will give you an outlet to actively promote your band online and get information about your gigs out there.Your band should use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Soundcloud, Bandnation, Reverb, Spotify, and any other site where you can get your name and music out. Film recordings of songs or practice sessions to give people a taste of your music and the vibe of your band. People will be more likely to listen to the music online if they have something to watch, too. Consider doing a cover song and uploading it onto a well known site like YouTube to get lots of views. This will get your band's name out and then drive people to your other videos of original music. Keep a newsletter for your band. Post your newsletter on your website and then link to it on all of your social media accounts. The newsletter should talk about what your band is up to and give insight into every step of your career to create a long lasting relationship with the fans.  A great way to get your band's name out there is to get people using and wearing items with your information on it. You should be using your own promo material as much as possible as well.Have t-shirts made with your band's name, logo, album art, website, or other contact information on it, and give the shirts to friends, family, and fans to wear. Give away promo material at all of your gigs. Stickers, pens, artwork such as small prints of your album cover, or magnets are great examples of items to hand out.  Don’t underestimate the old promotional technique of putting up flyers all over town. When you have a gig coming up, create a flyer telling everyone when and where your band will be performing. Put the flyers up all over the town you’ll be performing in.Make sure you get permission to put the flyers up before you do so, otherwise they may be taken down. Ask stores to let you put flyers up in their windows or on their door. Put flyers in restroom stall doors. People will be forced to look at your flyer while they’re in there. Think of your fanbase and put flyers up in places you think they'll visit frequently. Ask your fans for help with distributing the flyers. Upload the file of the flyer to your website for fans to download and print out.  College radio or small market local stations are the best bet for trying to break into getting play time. Send a demo and follow up with the station by asking them if they will play your music on the air.  Successful bands obviously know how to get noticed, and they may have great advice for your group. By associating your band with a more popular one, the exposure may gain you some fans and make industry professionals take notice.   See bands similar to yours play on a regular basis. Especially when your band is just starting out, local bands with big followings can be a major asset. While there, strike up a conversation with your fellow musicians between sets. If you hit it off, mention your band and give them your contact info. Ask to open for bigger acts. Once you get to know other bands in your local scene, you can start asking to open for them. This tactic is great for when you're having trouble booking your own gigs.Opening for major touring artists usually comes down to local contacts. Before you open for a major band, you'll have to establish a solid local reputation and a respectable fanbase. Once that happens, start hitting up local industry contacts to find out who is putting together a show you're interested in opening for and simply ask to do so. Depending on circumstances, you can even try contacting the band directly. As you become better established, booking agents will likely begin to approach you with opportunities to open.	Get a website. Promote yourself online. Give away promotional material. Use flyers. Send your demo to radio stations. Get help from established bands.
Lay the bandana on a flat surface. Spread the edges outward until the bandana is a large square. Smooth any folds so that the bandana lies flat.   Turn the bandana so that one corner is facing you. This will make it easier to fold into a bracelet.; , Take the bottom corner of the bandana in your fingers and bring it to meet the top corner. Smooth the center fold and you should have a nice triangle shape.          If you don't want your bracelet to be as thick you can cut your bandana across the fold line to create two triangles.Once folded, the half bandana will look very similar but it will feel a lot less bulky.  Take a couple inches of fabric from the top corner and fold it down over the rest of the bandana. You can fold the section slightly larger or smaller depending the width you want your bracelet to be. Continue to fold over the width of the bandana until you reach the folded part of the triangle you made.  Start by placing the folded bandana on your wrist. Leave a little more length hanging on the left side than the right, if wearing it on your right hand. Take the right side and wrap in under your wrist, then pull it over the top of your wrist.          If you have a flat surface to work on, you can also lay your wrist on the folded bandana. Leave a little more of the length of the bandana on your right side. Fold the right end over your wrist. Then, fold the right end underneath your wrist again so the end is sticking out on the right side again.  Hold the part that went over your wrist with the hand that is wearing the bandana. Then grab the left piece with your free hand. Wrap the left end of the bandana under your wrist, then over the top of the wrist.  Hold on to the left end with your left hand. Use your fingers on your right hand to grab the right end. If you have to, use your teeth to grab it and move it to where your fingers can hold the end in place by pressing it to your palm.   If you're with a friend, have your friend grab the ends and tie them for you.  Bring the left end over the right end, then wrap it underneath. Pull the left end down while holding the right end in place to tighten the knot.          Knot the ends twice to help keep your bracelet from coming undone too easily. Adding a second knot may make difficult to untie, and you may have to even cut it off to remove it. If you want to keep the bracelet on permanently, adjust the bracelet to a comfortable size and tie a second knot. Wrap the left end around the right again and pull the end through the loop, then pull both ends until tight. You could also use a hair pin, safety pins, or rubber bands to hold your bracelet ends in place. Put a pin through the left end, then through the right end and fasten the pin to keep them together. Or wrap a rubber band around the left and right ends to keep them held together. Either of these methods will work if you have such items handy.  Take the remaining tips of fabric sticking out from the knot or pins and tuck them underneath the bracelet. You can also trim off the ends with scissors if you prefer.	Open up the bandana. Fold the square bandana into a triangle. Fold the top corner down. Begin wrapping the bandana. Wrap the other segment. Grab the ends. Tie the ends into a knot. Tuck the unwanted ends.
All subwoofers come in a variety of sizes ranging from 8 inches (20.3 cm) to 15 inches (38 cm) and must be fitted in an enclosure (speaker box) and connected to an amplifier. The difference between the different types of subwoofer speakers lies in the enclosure/amplifier setup:   Component subwoofers come speaker only, meaning you have to choose the enclosure and amplifier separately. You can choose from a variety of enclosure types or have one made to your specifications. Component subwoofers are ideal for those who want a highly customized car stereo system. Enclosed subwoofers are pre-mounted in a box. You must choose an external amplifier for this type of speaker. Powered subwoofers include the speaker and the amp in 1 compact enclosure and are ideal for installing in small spaces, but not for producing big bass. Vehicle-specific subwoofers are designed to fit in the out-of-the-way spaces of your car, like the door, for example. These are perfect if you desire a discreet install for your car subwoofers, but they will not create a big bass sound.; , If you want big, rich bass sounds, you will want high-powered subwoofer speakers. Sensitivity. A subwoofer with higher sensitivity requires less power to handle big sound. Frequency range. If you want your subwoofer to be able to handle extremely low frequency sounds, you will need a high frequency range speaker. Enclosure type. The type of enclosure you choose for your car subwoofers has an effect on the quality of sound they produce. Number of voice coils. You can choose either single or dual voice coils. Custom car stereo system enthusiasts generally prefer dual voice coils because they offer more flexibility in wiring the sound system. Impedance. The impedance affects current flow and ranges from 2 to 8 ohms. It is important that your amplifier matches your speaker's impedance.  This will determine how many car subwoofers you should purchase. Generally speaking, you only need 2 subwoofers if you listen to hip hop, dance, techno or other bass-heavy music genres. Otherwise, 1 subwoofer should do.  Once you've settled on your subwoofer type and specifications, research your available options online.	Determine what kind of subwoofer you want. Consider the available specs options:   Power. Choose your genre. Search the Internet for product reviews. Shop around for the make and model you want to get the best price.
You will be working with glue and paint, so you should select a location that is well-ventilated. Lay a drop cloth over your working surface to prevent the paint and glue from getting on anything you do not want it on. You may also want to wear disposable plastic gloves and an apron or painter's smock to protect your clothes.; , Cheap welding goggles can be found online or at most home improvement stores. If possible, select a pair that at least has removable lenses, detachable straps, and a top that can be unscrewed. The goggles should be separated into as many pieces as possible.  If the lenses pop out completely, this step is not necessary. If the lenses are still held together by plastic, however, the plastic will need to be painted along with the outer rim or base. To protect the lenses from getting paint on them, cover the inside and outside with painter's tape or masking tape.  To create steampunk goggles with an antique or worn appearance, you will need to apply several coats of different metallic colors. Start by applying a silver or nickel metallic finish to the base section or body of the goggles. Use a dull finish, rather than a shiny one, to create an old-style look. Apply the finish with a cotton swab or cheap paintbrush. Let dry.  The lens piece or lens pieces should be a different color than the body. Consider using a dull copper finish, applying it to the pieces with a clean paintbrush or cotton swab. If there are other pieces, such as buttons that go on the side of the body, paint these a different color, as well. You can either use the same dull copper finish used for the lens piece or you can use a dull gold finish. Let dry.  Paint over any piece that you painted copper or bronze with a copper patina paint. The paint should look brown or greenish-brown. If there are ridges or raised portions of the area being painted, apply the patina paint to the crevices in between the raised portions; otherwise, apply it around the entire area. Do not paint a solid layer of patina over the finish. Instead, dab it on using a painting sponge or apply some over the area before rubbing some off with a wrinkled paper towel.   A patina is a type of film that that appears over the surface of bronze and copper over time due to oxidation of the metal.       This gives you the aged effect to the goggles.  If you painted any pieces with gold finish, make those pieces look aged by making the gold look worn. Even though gold does not corrode, many pieces are made with gold leaf to save on cost, and gold leaf eventually wears off over time. To create the appearance of scratched gold leaf, apply a pewter or dull silver paint along the edges or raised portions of the gold pieces.  You could use old or damaged jewelries to add as ornaments if you can't find a gold leaf. just paint it and attached it later to the sides of the goggles.  Once all the paint has dried, put the goggles back together. Remove the tape from the lenses or pop them back in place if they were completely removed. Leave the strap or band off the goggles.  Random gears of various shapes and sizes are the standard embellishment of choice, but you can also use a variety of other objects, like custom pieces crafted with polymer clay, animals or objects from old Lego sets, or Victorian-style brooches and small cameos. The idea is to select pieces that either look Victorian in style or that look very industrial in nature. If these pieces already have an antique look to them, nothing more needs to be done. If not, you may want to paint them with dull metallic finishes so that they match the worn style of your goggles.  Use super glue or a hot glue gun. It does not matter much where you glue them, but generally, the pieces should be kept off the lenses and on the body of the goggles or in between the lenses on a solid lens piece.  Add broken watch gears to give detail and add an industrial look.  If desired, you can further embellish your steampunk goggles by attaching a clip on lens or detachable loupe set to the front of your goggles. The screw of the loupe set should be positioned in between the lenses, pointing outward, so that the lenses of the loupe set can be spun in front of the lenses of your goggles. Adhere the clip-on loupe set in place with hot glue or super glue.   Using a broken element of a camera lens, glue them together with other embellishments.  Once all the paint and glue has finished drying, the goggles are ready to be worn and admired.  The belt should be thin enough to slide into the strap holders. Ideally, if you want your goggles to have a worn appearance, the belt will also look worn or distressed. Cut the belt into three parts, removing a large portion of the middle section and making sure that the buckled section and holed section are large enough to wrap around your head.  If the belt is too thin and will not stay on its own, you may need to use a few dots of superglue to keep it in place.    Admire your one of a kind steampunk goggles!	Prepare the area. Take apart a pair of welding goggles. Cover the lenses with tape. Apply a base coat of metallic finish to the base. Add a base coat of metallic finish to the other pieces. Use paint to create the look if patina. Create the look of worn off gold leaf. Reassemble the goggles. Prepare various embellishments. Glue the pieces onto your goggles. Attach a clip-on lens for added flair. Let everything dry. Cut apart an old leather belt.You will need a leather band for your steampunk goggles, and the best way to do this is to use an old leather belt. Feed the cut ends of the belt through the strap holders. You're done and ready to wear.
There are many brands and options out there. Kenwood, Pioneer, JL audio, and Sony are top of the line in this category. Each of these brands offers an entire line of stereos that are suited to fit different needs and budgets.; , Match the colors on the harnesses or follow the included diagram. This makes it much easier to install and later remove the head-unit should you decide to take it to another car, and a wiring harness adapter usually only costs around $20 or less.You may also need to purchase an antenna adaptor for your new head unit and vehicle., You will need a service manual such as Haynes, but any manual that provides details for your make and model should work. Every stereo is different, and sometimes it is required that you remove parts of the dash/console to remove the stereo. This is where the manual will be most helpful.It can also be helpful to have a comprehensive guide on aftermarket stereo installation.  This will cut power to the car and allow you to safely work on the electrical components (like stereo wiring).  This will usually consist of taking off some portion of the dash and or faceplate (consult your service manual) and then taking out the mounting screws that hold in your head unit. Once you’ve done this, the unit will slide right out., It will be plugged into the back of your head unit. You will have access to it when you pull the head unit out. Some people choose to cut these wires away (especially if they didn’t purchase a wiring adaptor) but this can void the warranty., The wires will be clearly marked, as the adaptor is designed to make your car and head unit fit together. Crimp the wires as instructed in the wiring harness adapter's instructions. After crimping (or soldering as some choose to do), twist on appropriate sized wire nuts and make sure to keep your wires as neat as possible., This part is even easier than connecting the adaptor to the head unit. It literally is designed to plug right into your factory wiring harness. Do that now., If you needed an antenna adaptor, you can plug it into the back of the head unit and plug the antenna lead into the adaptor. Otherwise, your antenna should plug directly into the back of the head unit., The size of your original and aftermarket head units may be different. They typically come in one of three sizes - Single DIN, DIN and a half, Double DIN. If your aftermarket head unit is a different size than the original, you may need an adaptor, or DIN cage, to mount it.If they are the same size, the aftermarket stereo should bolt into the original mounting brackets for the head unit., This is where your service manual will come in handy again. Now you need to put back together any pieces of the dash that were removed to get the stereo out., This will restore power to your car, and by extension, your new head unit.  Now you should be able to turn on your stereo and enjoy a crisp, clean sound.	Select a new head unit. Buy the wiring harnesses for your head unit and your vehicle. Purchase a service manual for your car. Unhook your battery’s ground terminal. Remove the original head unit. Unplug the wiring harness. Connect your wiring harness adaptor to your new head unit. Plug the wiring harness adaptor into the factory wiring harness. Connect the head unit to the antenna. Mount the new head unit. Replace any dash components. Reconnect the battery ground terminal. Test your stereo.
Size the purse to hold your desired items; one suggested measurement is about 22cm/8.6" high x 14cm/5/5" width, but feel free to adjust as preferred. Use the guidelines in the image to help you create your templates:   Two dark brown felt pieces for the background of the ice cream One light brown/beige felt piece for the cone of the ice cream Two fluffy white felt pieces for the ice cream Two round red felt pieces for the cherry.;	Cut the felt pieces.
This will help you find out which character will be found on hand at which time on any given day of the year. While a few characters can be found on premises each day, not all characters make an appearance, and the Times Guide will be able to tell you which ones you can see. Plan your times ahead of schedule, if there is a special character you'd like to see. Try to prevent meltdowns from beginning just by reading this schedule.; ,, At some points of the day, characters can be found in their house in Toontown USA (near Fantasyland).  Some characters, especially classic Mickey and even sometimes Minnie, make special appearances around hundreds of thousands of fans in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle.  These other characters may meet and sign kids books with the same name, but some kids become reluctant to see these characters when they don't look the same as what they are shown in movies and television.  While some may make a few special appearances, this park is meant for the older crowd and adults, and few times characters don't think they may interact with kids in that specific park. , Some will walk and hope to catch your gleaming eye.  However, when one child finds a character, most children speak up loud enough that other kids nearby will visit and character meets become "scenes".  Some are more than willing to talk with the children than others. Don't let your child (or the child inside you) be discouraged if the character isn't allowed to say anything back. Some non-face characters are told not to speak with children for obvious reasons of breaking character, while most face characters (as Disney calls them) are more than willing to talk with most guests they encounter during the day. Non-face characters talk using hand actions and body language. They can still talk in their own way.   However, don't plan to take up the characters entire time, if the character is able to speak with your child. They can answer a question or two, but they'll need to consult with other fans too. Don't let your children feel insulted if the character answers a question and then walks off or talks with other children.	Look towards the Times Guide you can pick up at the park's entrance. Try to plan your day around a schedule that is set up to meet with the characters.  , Try to determine well in advance where the characters you are intending to meet can be found, so that you waddle over to the area with your kids, so they can meet with the characters in a way they feel most comfortable meeting with them. Know when and where they make special appearances. Know the difference between the classic characters and those of the special characters that may have been jazzed up for other occasions. Don't look to meet many characters in some areas of Disneyland's California Adventure Theme Park. Walk with your kids around the park in the direction of the area the character is to be expected to meet with guests on the given day.  , Realize that some characters may not even be staged in any of the areas, and some may be walking the park much like you, the guest, do. Have an autograph book, camera and pen ready if you find this situation to be happening with the character nearby. Have the child interact with the character, if the character doesn't have other children nearby.
Before you can write your statement, you should ask yourself some important questions. Your statement is your chance to discuss your art process, your ideas, and how your art fits in the field. Be honest with yourself as you answer these questions:What are my influences (e.g. personal, historical, theoretical, cultural)? What themes, ideas, and subjects are in my art? What do I do? How do I do it? Why do I it? What do I want other people to understand about my art? Is there anything about my art that I do not want to discuss? Why?; , Set a timer for 15 minutes and write down your responses to these questions. If your responses lead you down another path, write about those things as well. This exercise helps you move your ideas from your head to a piece of paper. You can incorporate drawings into this writing process as well.It may be helpful to target your writing to one specific question instead of trying to answer multiple questions. For example, you may choose to write about why you use oil to paint. You can also write on multiple pieces of art paper instead of a notebook so that you can rearrange your ideas and make them more visual.  A mind map is a visual diagram that lets you connect information to once central idea. Think of it as an idea tree.Write the answer to one of your questions in the middle of the page. The you can use arrows or dotted lines for all of the answers to your questions.All of the arrows and/or dotted lines do not have to connect to the center of the diagram. Some of them may connect to each other. You can also use pictures or drawings to communicate your thoughts and answers.  Reading examples of good and poorly written artist's statements can help you craft your statement. Pay special attention to artists whose work is similar to yours and artists that you admire.You may want to read examples after you have finished brainstorming. This will help you format your ideas without being influenced by others.   Check out books, exhibition catalogs, and periodicals to find examples. If you are in school, ask your teacher for examples or talk to a librarian. Take note of the phrasing that people use to describe their work.  It can be hard to write about your art. Display your art and invite some of your friends over. Video and/or audio record the conversation so you can listen to it later. You should also take notes during the discussion.Pay special attention to any questions and critiques about your work. These things are often what people really want to know about your work. Consider discussing your work with both artists and non-artists. This will allow you to see your art from multiple perspectives. Another option is to have a friend interview you about your work.	Ask yourself some questions. Write down your ideas. Mind-map your ideas. Read some examples. Talk to your friends.
Depending upon how often you plan to move your bike, what kinds of conditions you expect to encounter, how handy you are with tools, and your budget, there are a variety of different trailers that will be appropriate for your purposes.A variety of trailers are made to fit certain models or brands of bike. Check with your bike retailer for specific trailer suggestions for the model.   Renting a trailer is usually the most common option, since most companies that provide the equipment usually keep it very well-maintained, and in compliance with federal and state law in terms of registration, plates, and lighting. Size-wise, a 5' X 9' open trailer with a fold-down ramp is ideal for one or two cruisers. It's also good to have tie-down rings in the front corners, on the floor. Some trailers made specifically for motorcycle trailers have very small tires, which bounce uncontrollably as you drive. If the bike is worth towing, use a heftier trailer.; , Measure the wheelbase and the ground clearance of the bike, to make sure you get a ramp that's big enough for your purposes. Most trailers should come with a pull-down ramp, but if you're going to rent one, or try to trailer a bike in your truck, you'll want to be sure it'll work. Wheelbase is measured from the center of the front wheel to the center of the rear wheel of your bike. Ground Clearance is measured from the lowest point of the motorcycle, halfway between the front and rear wheels. You also want to measure the height of the trailer or the truck bed, in which you're trying to load the bike.  Laws vary from state to state, so it's always a good idea to investigate any special permits, laws, rules of the road, or licenses that you might need in order to stay in compliance with local law enforcement.   Most rental companies will offer a temporary insurance policy, which may cover only their equipment and which may require you to pay a deductible. Check with your insurance company to see whether the rental insurance will be sufficient, just to be on the safe side.  To pull a trailer with weight up to a ton, you'll need something with rear-wheel drive rated to tow two thousand pounds. Crown Victorias or Chevy Caprices work great.   Hitches are rated based on the tongue-weight of different trailers, and you'll need an appropriate hitch for the trailer you use. For motorcycles, Class 1 or 2 hitches are usually fine.Smaller cars can work for smaller trailers, but anything more than a ton needs a heftier vehicle. Trucks and SUVs, from Ford Rangers to Chevy Colorados are usually better than any car. If you're going to tow a much bigger trailer, in excess of two tons, you'll need at least a half-ton truck like an F-150 or a Silverado. a half-ton truck like a Ford F-150 or Chevy Silverado., There are several varieties of these straps but the ratchet type are easier to compress the suspension than the pull strap type, and they are available at most home centers and discount stores.   Pay attention to the Working Load Limit of the straps you get and choose a strap that has a working load limit of at least half the weight of your motorcycle. For instance if your bike weighs 650 pounds, find a strap with a working load limit of at least 325 pounds each. Most one-inch nylon straps will have this rating.  A wheel chock is a sturdy material made of metal or hard plastic that is placed around the front wheel of the motorcycle to inhibit it from moving. While the wheel chock is not a requirement to trailer your bike, it certainly makes the chore much easier, especially if you are loading and strapping without the assistance of a friend.   If you do not have a chock then park the bike at the very front of the trailer. If there is a rail on the trailer your front tire should be pressed against the rail.  Push the bike up the ramp into the bed of the trailer, placing the front wheel into the wheel chock. Place the front wheel of your motorcycle into the wheel chock.  A general rule for strapping anything is to attach the straps as high as possible on the bike and as low as possible on the trailer for the greatest holding power. Use an "X" pattern for maximum stability.   Start with the front left strap (as viewed from a sitting position on the bike). Secure one end of the strap to the trailer and the other to a rigid point on the frame, or triple tree. Tighten the front left strap until it is taut. Next attach the front right strap in the same manner as the front left strap. Since your bike is on the side stand it will be leaning to the left but in the end we want the bike to be perfectly vertical when secured. You may want to use some soft loops on the motorcycle end of the strap, to protect the bike, then attach the ratchet strap to the soft loop.  Secure the other hook end of the strap to a secure spot in your truck or trailer, preferably on an angle. Pull the slack out of the strap and ratchet it a few times. Repeat this same process for the right side. Tighten each ratchet strap so that the bike will sit in the upright position on its own.   You will notice the bike start moving into a vertical position and your front suspension compressing. Once the bike is vertical you will want to tighten the left and right sides equally until the suspension is completely compressed. Don't strap the handlebars. Most manufactures say that it's not safe to attach ratchet straps to the handlebars because they are simply not designed to take the pressures that will be exerted by the straps and a bouncy road.  Remember to secure the straps rearward of the motorcycle so that the rear straps put counter tension on the front straps, making your bike an immovable fixture on the trailer.   Do not tie the straps to guards on saddle bags or trunks as it is likely you will pull the guards off during transit. Again you will want to compress the suspension as you ratchet the straps.  As you ratchet the straps down, you need to make sure the suspension is compressed fully. If it is not compressed it is possible that your straps can come loose as the bike rebounds, bouncing around from bumps and dips in the road.  You don't want the first time you drive with a trailer to be the first time you've got your prized bike strapped to it, driving at highway speeds in the elements. Practice hooking up your trailer and driving around a bit to get a feel for things.   Practice tight corners, driveways, and backing up specifically. Take it for a test run on a highway, at high speed. Get a sense of how you will need to adjust your regular driving habits to accommodate driving with the trailer attached.  After securing the bike to the trailer, use a canvas or vinyl tarp to cover it and keep it safe from the elements, or the cover you use for your motorcycle when you park it. The tarp doesn't need to be doing any load-bearing work, so just tie it firmly down to the straps, or to the bike.  It's important to go back and check all the straps and make sure they are not rubbing any parts on your bike. Also recheck the tension on the straps. On a longer trip, do a walk around every time you stop and re-check the straps again. It's always best to be on the safe side.	Pick a trailer that suits your needs. Get a corresponding ramp for the trailer. Learn the trailer permit laws in your area. Make sure you have an appropriate vehicle with a hitch. Get some ratchet straps. Get a wheel chock for the front of the trailer. Use the ramp to load the bike. Put the side stand down and attach the straps. Secure the straps to the trailer and ratchet them down. Strap the rear of the bike. Make sure the suspension is compressed. Practice driving around with the trailer attached to your main transport vehicle. Cover the bike with a tarp. Recheck the straps regularly.
Take a photo of your pet then find a small frame with a hook so that you can hang it on the tree. During the holiday season craft stores will probably have small decorations that you could even glue to the frame- like foam stickers.; , Just have a member in your family hold the animal or get the animal to stand next to someone in the picture. This will show that they are a part of your family.  For example, you could have your dog wear a Christmas collar or put a red ribbon around your fish tank. This just adds decoration to them and the room.  While everyone is opening presents, give your pet a gift, such as a bone for a dog or a toy for a cat. It is also fun to wrap your gift for a dog, sometimes they will even unwrap it themselves.  If you live where it snows, then just take your dog outside to play with it. Or just spend a little time with your pet inside on Christmas giving it special attention, even if it's just a belly rub.	Make an ornament with their picture on it. Include them in your family's Christmas card, if it is possible. Make them appear more festive with holiday decorations. Give your pet a gift. Play with your animal around the holidays.
A flight dispatcher is responsible for ensuring that safety guidelines are followed during a flight, knowing what weather patterns to expect and how to work around them, determining how much fuel will be needed for a flight, and many other things. This is an important position and comes with a great deal of responsibility, so do some research and educate yourself on what being a flight dispatcher entails.; , A comprehensive list can be found at the FAA's website.   Although no more than a high school diploma is necessary to enroll in an FAA-approved flight dispatcher certification course, a college background in air transportation or meteorology is beneficial to prospective students.    Be aware that training programs are rigorous and intense. They generally last 5 to 6 weeks and comprise 200 hours of training. Some programs are residential while others can be taken part-time. Night classes are generally not an option, so be aware of this if you plan to stay at your present job while training. a. Be aware that course tuition at training schools can often be costly, often ranging from $4000 USD to $5000 USD. Financial aid is available at some institutions. Exams can cost several hundred dollars, but most schools include the price of exams in their overall tuition. The exams are administered by your school at the end of the 5 to 6 week training program. ,   The test is comprised of 80 questions which you must complete in 3 hours. The test includes assessment in 6 basic areas in the oral/practical portion: flight planning, pre-flight and takeoff procedures, in-flight procedures, landing procedures, post-flight procedures, and emergency procedures.	Understand the duties of a flight dispatcher before you decide to pursue this career. Locate an FAA-approved flight dispatcher training school. Apply to the program of your choice and enroll in courses where you'll learn about flight planning, navigation systems, fuel requirements, plotting charts, and other necessary skills required for the job. Prepare strenuously for the FAA required aircraft dispatcher certification exam by studying and taking advantage of any practice exams administered by the school in which you are enrolled.  , Pass the FAA Aircraft Dispatcher (ADX) certification exam to qualify for employment as a flight dispatcher. Apply for jobs as flight dispatcher with various airlines.
If you get pulled over, present all of the identification requested of you and resist any urges to be antagonistic to the officer involved; do not give them any more reason to want to give you a ticket.Ask for as much information as possible, including where they first saw you and how long they paced you.While this scenario is a stressful one, being agreeable and friendly may get you out of a speeding ticket..   If you’re feeling bold, try asking the officer if they will consider giving you a warning instead of a ticket.  Paying a speeding ticket right away is essentially an admission of guilt; you generally have 90 days to either enter a plea or pay the fine, so delay paying to explore your options. In many cases, fighting the ticket will not mean going to trial.Take the time to inspect your ticket for any errors in information (e.g. citation number, location of where you were stopped and the time of day you received the ticket)., In addition to being costly, speeding tickets can raise your insurance premiums for several years.Whether or not you're guilty, always contest your ticket; you have the chance of at least reducing the fine. Cases are often thrown out if the officer in question doesn't not show up to court, if they go to court at all.	Be respectful and friendly. Delay paying a ticket. Always contest a ticket.
(Paper will work too.)  , The beginning conceptualization is of a stationary rotating double "O."  ,   Do not get too aggressive when marking the center point. If you drive the push pin through a whole bunch of cards, the top ones might have a large, unsightly center point. Instead, mark only a few at a time, using the last visible prick as the starting location for the next set. An alternative to the push pin is to use a needle and thimble. Again, do not get in a hurry or too aggressive with marking the cards. ,,,,,, Use your imagination and invite the kids to get involved in this fun, creative activity.   Use the double "O" as a central element for a more extensive scene. Make the double "O"s travel linearly, back and forth, along an arc, along the periphery of still larger circle, across the solar system...  Use the push pin/needle technique to transfer the needed guidelines and design elements to later cards in the book. Lightly pencil in the guidelines on each card (to be erased later).   Create a circle that gives the illusion of rotating clockwise, stopping, then rotating counter-clockwise. Work to produce an army of bouncing "O"s, all bouncing at different heights and at different rates. Have them roll off the screen and back onto the screen. Make the green one disappear, then reappear a moment later inside a garden - and start growing. Have the double "O"s perform unexpected actions at the strangest times,.	Cut many smaller pieces of light cardstock all the same size. Staple these together evenly along one edge. Drive a push pin through the stack to mark the center of the larger circle. Using a compass draw the same size large circle on each page.  , Locate the touch point on successive pieces of paper to achieve the pattern you envision.  , Draw a smaller circle by placing the pencil point on the touch point and placing the pointed pivot of the compass on the visual diameter of the large circle, then carefully scribe the smaller circle.  , Draw the rest of the smaller circles in the same way without changing the compass setting.  , Shade each smaller circle with pencil or color the interiors.  , Test the effect by fanning through the book.  , Brainstorm further variations. Extend the concept and experiment with zoetropes.
The unspoken rule of metal concerts is, however, not to wear the shirt for the band you are going to see. Find a band shirt for a similar band in the same genre as the one you are going to see. Black t-shirts or tank tops with graphic designs are always good choices for a rock or metal show. Avoid anything that isn't cotton. If you are moshing or in a large crowd you will definitely sweat!  , Keep in mind, rockers mix feminine and masculine in their looks, its going to be the accessories that tie this look together.   Match your tee with dark green, dark blue, black or dark purple jeans. If you want to style up your look a little more, try swapping jeans for a peplum skirt or fitted red mini. Either of these provides a feminine chic look. Plaid miniskirts are especially popular at punk rock concerts. If you are going to a heavy metal concert and plan to be in the mosh pit, wear jeans rather than a skirt. , Military boots, and dark sneakers are all rocker-chic.   Again, you want comfort as concerts are typically in packed areas. Nevertheless, this look lends itself to flats rather than heels. Try to wear shoes with a thicker material at the toe. Your feet will be stomped on quite a bit. Experienced metal heads advise to always wear combat boots to a heavy metal concert. Even sneakers won't protect your feet from all the stomping! , Keep in mind that rock looks combine masculine and feminine styles. The accessories are really a chance to make your look more feminine.   Layer bracelets (cuffs, leather bands, studded bangles, and jeweled wrap-arounds) until you have an eclectic look. Leather studded cuffs and belts are always good accessories for a rock or metal concert. Earrings should be minimal studs. Avoid long necklaces. If you are moshing or dancing at a rock concert, these can get pulled. , Simple light make-up and simple hairstyles are best, though. If you are dancing or moshing, your makeup might run. Wear waterproof makeup if possible. Avoid curling your hair too much, as this style isn't really in fashion for a rock or metal look. Ponytails and braids are simple and practical hairstyles for a rock or metal show.Brightly colored hair and mohawk styles are popular for a punk rock look.	Get a rock band or heavy metal band t-shirt. Match your bottom. Get the right shoes. Build the look with accessories. Hair and make up can be worn to personal preference.
The "CAGED" system is a set of five simple, open chords that are easy for beginning guitar students to learn. These common chords don't require complex finger movements and appear in a variety of songs.Do a search online, and you can find plenty of free resources to help you get started in this system, including chord charts and teaching tips and tricks. The CAGED system includes the chords C, A, Am, G, E, Em, D, and Dm. These chords have relatively simple shapes that are easy to learn and transition between. Once your students have these chords down along with a few basic strumming patterns, they should be able to play thousands of songs. Structure each lesson around a chord or two, and making a simple transition.; , Many students want to learn how to play guitar so that they can play their favorite songs. Try to pick a variety of songs in different genres so your students can learn something with which they're already familiar.For example, you may want to find a classic rock song and a country or folk song that uses the chords taught in each of your lessons. If you can find several, your students can pick the songs that most appeal to them. Many songs also have simplified, beginner versions that you can use to motivate your students and make them feel like they're making progress. Seek these out especially for students who mention favorite songs they've always wanted to play. Inspire confidence – don't simply tell them that the song they want to play is "too hard" or "too complex." You also can use the recordings of those songs to get your students up to speed. Once they learn the chords and how to transition between chords smoothly, they can practice playing along with the recording.  A limited number of well-defined targets is much easier for beginning students to understand. If you give them too much with each lesson, they may become overwhelmed and abandon their lessons.Decide early on what level of students you want to teach, and develop methods for teaching students at that level. How you teach beginning students will differ from how you would teach intermediate or advanced students. If your ultimate goal is to keep students for a long time and have them progress in their musicianship and handling of the instrument, you need to be able to identify when you need to step up your teaching methods to match their progress. This is something you'll learn to pick up intuitively with practice.  To play any instrument well, a musician must have a handle on both theory and technique. In your first lessons with a beginner, include a light introduction to theory, but work on building their physical capability to play the instrument before you worry too much about it in your lessons.You can briefly explain the theory behind the focus of each lesson (the chords you're teaching, or the strumming pattern being used), but leave it at that unless the student expresses an interest in learning more. Keep in mind that even if the student is interested, too much technique at first can be overwhelming – especially to an anxious student who just wants to start playing already. At the same time, a good bit of theory may be comforting to students who have been classically trained in another instrument, such as piano or violin, because they can fit the guitar into the musical understanding they already have.  Particularly if you are giving private lessons to individual students, your curriculum should have flexibility so it can be tailored to each student's personal goals and skill level. Not everyone will learn at the same pace.You may want to create a questionnaire for your students to fill out before their lessons start. Include questions that will allow you to learn each student's general musical background and any experience trying to play the guitar. You also want to get an idea of the types of music they like and their goals for learning guitar. These questionnaires can help you better tailor the lessons to each individual student. For example, if a student's goal is to be able to play a certain song, you can identify the chords in that song and start there. Some students will appreciate a lot of theory and practicing scales early on, before moving to actual songs. Other students will get frustrated with this. The questionnaire and conversation with your students can help you identify how they will be happiest with their lessons.  Your students aren't going to learn to play guitar if all they do is show up to their sessions and then leave their guitar in its case all week. Finger positions and strumming patterns will only become natural with repetition.For students that aren't very self-motivated or self-directed, you might want to provide them with a basic practice schedule. List the things you've gone over in the lesson, and leave space for them to place a check mark after each thing for each day they practice it. At the beginning of each lesson, briefly go over what was covered in the last lesson. If the student was given a song to play for practice, ask them to play it for you so you can evaluate their progress. If your students fail to practice, start a dialogue to find out why. Be open and understanding. If they have something else going on in their life that is preventing them from making a commitment to practicing, you may want to allow them to postpone their lessons until their schedule loosens up a bit.  Beginning guitarists are going to have difficulty moving their fingers with speed and agility. This is especially true for those who've never played any other stringed instrument.You typically can find a number of finger-strengthening exercises online. Many are geared specifically for students beginning to learn guitar. Look for exercises that focus on building finger muscles and spreading the fingers. Even students who have played other instruments may need to strengthen their pinky fingers, which often don't get worked as much with other instruments as they do with guitar. The stronger the student's fingers get, the easier they will find it to move more quickly and accurately on the fret board.	Start with the CAGED system. Find popular songs that use the chords you teach. Keep your lessons simple. Focus on technique over theory. Maintain flexibility. Emphasize practice between sessions. Provide exercises for improving finger strength.
Choose as many strands of thread as you like, as long as you're using three or more, and pick any number of colors that would look good together in a pattern. If you only use one color of thread, you won't be able to create a pattern.4-6 strands will make a narrow bracelet, and 8-10 strands will make a thicker one. The more strands you chose, the wider the bracelet will be.; , Measure a length of thread slightly longer than the distance from your fingertip to your shoulder and then cut it. This will be long enough for the bracelet to stretch around your wrist to create a pattern. It's better to cut the string a bit too long than too short.  Hold the cut strand up to the remaining strands and cut them to be the same length as this strand.  You can also get creative and tie it around your toe.      You can also tape it to a surface, or close it in a drawer, but pinning is better than taping because the pin ensures that the bracelet will stay in its position.  Before you start the system of knotting that will create a pattern in the bracelet, spread out the threads so that the colors are in the order you'd like the striped patterns on the bracelet to be. To make the knotted end of your bracelet less bulky, try not to cross the threads over one another too much.  You will need to make the "half-hitch" knot to do this correctly.         First, move the first thread over the top of the 2nd thread. Make sure to leave some of the first strand on the other side so that there is a loop. Bring the first thread behind the second thread and then pull it through the loop. Hold the second thread firmly while you pull on the first thread. As you do this, a knot will move up to the top of the second thread.  After you make the second knot with the first and second strand, you will need to use the first strand to make two knots in the third strand, and then the fourth, and so on. Keep going until there are two knots on every strand.         Make sure that you pull on the thread just until you feel resistance. Be careful not to pull too tight because if some knots are tighter than others the bracelet will look lumpy and uneven.Continue knotting the first strand around each successive thread, moving from left to right, until you've knotted all of the strands and the first strand is in the far right position., This will be the new first thread. Every thread will end up on the right when you're done, and you'll start with a new color of thread every time. Repeat the double knot technique with the far left strand, moving from left to right until the strand is in the far right position.  To make sure it fits well, try it on your wrist. There should be enough extra room that you (or the person who will wear the bracelet) can fit about two fingers in next to your wrist.  Make sure that the knot doesn’t take up any of the length you need to wear the bracelet.  If you still have a lot of string left over, you can cut it short with a pair of scissors.  Now that you've knotted both ends of the bracelet, just tie the strands of the bracelet together. If you have a friend putting on the bracelet for you, then you can also have the friend knot the bracelet after you put it on if you want it to be really tight.  Before beginning the main design, you can start with a simple braid, which will be on the ends of the bracelet. Gather neighboring individual strings into groups of two or three so that you have three main threads to braid with (left, center, right).  Take whichever thread is currently in the right position and cross it over the top of the center thread. That thread now becomes the center thread. Next, take whichever thread is currently in the left position and cross it over the top of the center thread so that thread now becomes the center thread.         Repeat this pattern -- right over center, left over center -- until you've reached the desired length of braid, which should be about an inch (2.54cm) or less.  Once you've reached the desired amount of the simple braid, about an inch (2.54cm) or less, tie a knot before you begin braiding the striped pattern.  If you did a simple braid for the beginning of the bracelet, you can do the same for the other end. After you have a good length of the striped pattern, finish the bracelet with a short length of simple braid.  To give your friendship bracelet some more flair, thread some small beads or charms onto the strands and then tie them in a knot to secure them.	Choose several strands of embroidery thread in a variety of colors. Measure and cut your first strand. Use the first strand to measure the remaining strands. Tie the strands in a knot and pin them to a stable surface.You can pin the bracelet to your pants, to a pillow, or to another stable cloth surface that you won't damage. Spread out the threads. Pass the first strand over the second strand to tie a knot. Repeat the same knot using the same strands. Start the process again with the far left thread. Continue until the bracelet is long enough for your wrist. Tie the second end of the bracelet into a knot. Trim away the additional string. Tie the bracelet together. Add a simple braid. Cross the right strand over the center strand. Tie a knot before you begin the main braid. Braid the other end of the bracelet. Add charms or beads to the end of the bracelet.
If you had to remove any parts of the exhaust to make room for the drill or welder, reattach them now.  It is likely that these were removed, especially if you were welding on your frame rails. Now that all of the welding is done, it is safe to reinstall your fuel lines and fuel tank.  If you removed carpet or other interior items to protect them from welding, you should reinstall them.  Subframe connectors improve the handling and quality of your ride, go out and enjoy the upgrade.	Reattach any exhaust components. Reinstall the fuel tank and lines. Reinstall all interior pieces. Enjoy the ride.
This will be used as the bottom of the hydroponic bed.; , Cut a further two pieces of lumber 15x85cm, and 5cm thick. These will be used as the siding of the hydroponic bed.  Screw the lumber border pieces together to create a frame, using two screws to attach each two lumber borders together. Then drill a 2cm hole in the centre 1cm from the bottom. This will later be used to drain excess water, preventing the plants from becoming swamped.  Place the frame down and the plywood on top. Use enough screws to make it secure, about 1 every 20cm is enough.  Cut the plastic giving the box an extra 30cm on each side. That would make the 6 millimetre plastic 1.3x1.8m. You also need to cut a hole in the plastic 44cm from the edge in the middle; this will also be used to drain water if it fills up too much, to prevent drowning the plants.  It has to be a completely smooth bottom. Wrap the excess over the edges of the box and tape it for now. Be sure to make sure the hole in the plastic and the hole in the wood line up.  Now that it is taped in place and smoothed, wrap wire around the edges to keep it into place.  It should only be sticking into the box about 4 cm.  The bed is complete and you can now start prepping it for planting. You can repeat as many times as you want until you get the amount of beds you want for your space.  You will find quite a few since the majority of what's being burned is pallets, and you don't want nails in your hydroponic bed, for obvious reasons. ,,, Take the 1L bottle and fill it halfway with the hard water. Add the nutrients (Zinc Sulphate: 2.2g, Manganese Sulphate: 15g, Copper Sulphate: 0.8g , Boric Acid: 28g, Sodium Molybdate: 0.25) one by one, letting them dissolve before adding the next one. Once finished, fill the bottle up to 1L. This will now be referred to as the Trace Mix Solution. It can be saved and used multiple times afterwards.  Fill the second 1L bottle halfway with hard water. Add the 20g of Chelated Iron from item #7. Fill the bottle up to 1L. This too can be used multiple times afterwards.  Add the Calcium Nitrate (item #2) and let it dissolve completely. Add the Potassium Nitrate (item #3) and let it dissolve completely. Add 100ml of the Iron Chelate solution. Fill the bucket up to 5L with water. This will be known as Mix 1.  Individually add the Sulphate of Potash (#4) Monopotassium Phosphate(#5) and Magnesium Sulphate individually, allowing each to dissolve fully before adding the next. Add 10ml of Trace Mix Solution. Fill the bucket up to 5L with water. This will be known as Mix 2.  You now have enough ingredients to supply 100L of nutrient solution for your plants.  Create a mix of 90% water, 5% Mix 1, 5% Mix 2. So to create 1L of nutrient solution, use 900ml of hard water, 50ml of Mix 1 and 50ml of Mix 2.  If they are already seedlings, plant them with a thin layer of charcoal between them and the bottom. If you're using seeds, then take out 1/4 of the charcoal and spread them and put the charcoal back on top. , After each time you harvest anything from these beds, you should wash them thoroughly, removing any unwanted growth and cleaning it. This should happen at least three times a year. ,	Cut out a piece of plywood measuring 1x1.5m, and 2.5cm thick. Cut two pieces of lumber 15x150cm, and 5cm thick. Get seven 1/2cm deck screws. Screw the frame down onto the plywood. Use standard 6 millimetre black plastic to hold the water. Place the plastic in the box, smoothing it out perfectly. Add wire. Take a 2cm circumference pipe, 10cm long and place it through the plastic and the wood holes. Done. Take 5kg's of charcoal and sift through it for nails with a decently powerful magnet. Rinse all of the charcoal thoroughly to just clean it off for the plants.  , Leave the charcoal out to dry for about a day in direct sunlight while being stirred occasionally.  , Once dried, the charcoal is ready to go into the bed, and you are finished with this part.  , Make the trace mix solution. Make an iron chelate solution. Take a 5L container, and fill it up with 4L of hard water. Take the second 5L container and fill it up with 4L of hard water. Understand that the reason you make two solutions (Mix 1 and Mix 2) is to avoid certain chemicals from reacting with each other over time. Use your nutrient solutions. Plant the plants you desire in the charcoal bed. Water your plants a couple times a day and they will be strong and healthy.  , Wash the beds out. Allow the charcoal to dry in the sun while stirring it occasionally.  , Repeat this entire cycle for clean efficient food.
If you have a Pepsi logo in the middle of your scenes, you will actually hurt your chances at getting into film festivals. Why? Because you would owe Pepsi money if the film was purchased, since they have the trademark. This includes music as well, meaning you can't use your favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers song unless you can pay for it.   In a pinch, tape and permanent markers are a great way to cover up logos on objects you can't move, like an oven or fridge.  On a long movie, you could lose weeks of work if an essential cast member ups and leaves midway through. Contracts may feel impersonal, but they are quite the obvious -- a contract allows you to stay friends by always knowing where each other stand. There is too much to do on a movie set as it is -- don't add bickering or worrying about payment and schedules, too., B-roll is generally considered any shots that don't have any spoken lines and non-essential shots that help transition through scenes. Watch a few movies and notice the little, 1-2 clips, usually between scenes, and note how they visually move the story along. Think of it like the shots outside the car in a road trip movie, the sleek shots of James Bond's new car, and any other purely visual embellishment or scene.   Be creative with B-roll, this is you and the DP's chance to be artful with much less stress. Make sure your b-roll fits the tone or tenor of the movie. Punch Drunk Love uses bright, abstract colors to indicate mood swings. Horror movies use slow, dark shots. Action movies use stark, extreme, and dramatic landscapes, etc., Movies get expensive, quickly, but the worst thing that can happen is a to run out of essential funds with only 10 pages left to shoot. You need to budget everything out considerably once you've finished pre-production, including:   Cast and crew wages and food Rights to music our sounds Transportation Props and Costumes Filming equipment, There are a lot of people who don't believe and director should edit their own work. Why? Because editing is about ruthlessly cutting the movie down to only the very best parts, and most directors are too attached to the material to cut it objectively. You will, of course, give guidance, and watch rough cuts and provide notes, but you should look online for another editor to help wade through the 100's of hours of footage you have.   Be ready to watch the movie hundreds of times. It can help to bring in a trusted friend or two as well to notice things you and your editor might miss. Depending on your editor's skill set, you may need a sound designer as well to create sound effects and find and place music.  This usually costs around a $1,000-$5,000 for a full-length movie. Mastering will take the audio volumes and balance them into a cohesive track, making sure everything is easy to here and there are no jarring transitions. Color correction simply ensures that every shot looks the same, fixing small issues and creating an eye-popping final image.   Color-correction is not simply a technical aspect-- it can be used to create the whole visual mood and motif of the scene by making it brighter or darker, more vibrant or more somber.  Throw them a wrap party. Buy them coffee and donuts every now and then. Many of these people will never be well known, and they will be putting in just as many backbreaking and tiring hours as you are. It is easy to remember to pamper your actors, but the crew is just as important and just as worth your attention.   Always be one of the first people on set. There will always be something for you to do, and it sets a good example.	Avoid the use of patented logos, trademarks, and copyrights as possible. Write contracts, even if you're just filming with friends. Set aside time to pick up B-roll, the connective footage that fills in between scenes. Make and keep track of a budget. Secure an editor for your film. Have the film professionally mastered and color corrected. Treat your crew, the unspoken soldiers of the film, with love and respect.
During and after a disaster, water can become contaminated with microorganisms, such as bacteria, sewage, agricultural or industrial waste, chemicals, and other substances that can cause illness or death.  Local authorities will tell you if tap water is safe to drink or to use for cooking or bathing. If the water is not safe to use, follow local instructions to use bottled water or to boil or disinfect water for cooking, cleaning, or bathing.  If your water supply is limited, you can use alcohol-based hand sanitizer for washing your hands.  If you do not know that the water came from a safe source, you should boil or treat it before you use it.  When practical, boiling water is the preferred way to kill harmful bacteria and parasites. Bringing water to a rolling boil for 1 minute will kill most organisms. Boiling will not remove chemical contaminants. If you suspect or are informed that water is contaminated with chemicals, seek another source of water, such as bottled water.   If you can't boil water, you can treat water with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or unscented household chlorine bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite). If you use chlorine tablets or iodine tablets, follow the directions that come with the tablets. If you use household chlorine bleach, add 1/8 teaspoon (~0.75 milliliter ) of bleach per gallon of water if the water is clear. For cloudy water, add 1/4 teaspoon (~1.50 mL) of bleach per gallon. Mix the solution thoroughly and let it stand for about 30 minutes before using it. Treating water with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or liquid bleach will not kill many parasitic organisms. Boiling is the best way to kill these organisms.  Contact your local health department for advice about water treatment products that are being advertised.  For example, fire truck storage tanks and previously used cans or bottles may be contaminated with microbes or chemicals. Water containers should be thoroughly cleaned, then rinsed with a bleach solution before use:   Mix soap and clean water in container. Shake or stir to clean inside of container, then rinse. For gallon- or liter-sized containers, add approximately 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) household bleach (5.25%) with 1 cup (240 mL) water to make a bleach solution. Cover the container and shake the bleach solution thoroughly, allowing it to contact all inside surfaces. Cover and let stand for 30 minutes, then rinse with clean water.  Wash your hands with soap and bottled water or warm water that has been boiled or disinfected. Wash your hands before preparing food or eating, after toilet use, after participating in clean-up activities, and after handling articles contaminated with floodwater or sewage. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to wash your hands if you have a limited supply of clean water.	Be conscious that water may not be safe to drink, clean with, or bathe in after an emergency such as a hurricane or flood. Listen to and follow public announcements. Use only bottled, boiled, or treated water for drinking (however, see guidance above for infants), cooking or preparing food, washing dishes, cleaning, brushing your teeth, washing your hands, making ice, and bathing until your water supply is tested and found safe. If you use bottled water, be sure it came from a safe source. Boil water. Do not rely on water disinfection methods or devices that have not been recommended or approved by local health authorities. Use water storage tanks and other types of containers with caution. Practice basic hygiene.
For most cars, you can find the VIN in one or more locations:Look on the dashboard, in the far left corner just under the windshield. It is usually easiest to see this from the outside, looking in the windshield. Look on the front of the engine block. Open the hood and look toward the front of the engine and you should find it on a metal plate. Look in the rear wheel well on the driver's side. The VIN may be located by looking directly up inside the wheel well. Look inside the driver's door, either under the side mirror or at the door handle. The VIN may be located either near where the door latches or directly under the side mirror. Check out https://www.autohausaz.com/html/vehicle_identification_numbers.html for a thorough list with specific VIN location for each car’s make and model.

Cut a short piece of cheap masking tape and hold it by either end. Gently press it down on your shirt or another clean surface to thin out some of the adhesive. Tear off a 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5.1 cm) pieces off the tape and attach the ends to make loops with the adhesive side up. Place the loops on the underside of the stencil. Press the stencil gently onto the fabric.; ,  The stencil should have a wide enough border that you can ink the negative space without leaving any “blow by,” or ink outside the stencil.   Try to lift it straight off without dragging it from side to side to avoid smudges.	Adhere the stencil to the surface you want to airbrush. Fill in the negative space with ink. Pull the stencil off and remove any tape that remains on the airbrushed surface.Make sure the ink on the stencil is dry before you use it again.
Good work always starts with having a good workspace.   Clean up an area to work on.       Pick up any objects that you wouldn't like to be damaged.       Clamp the torch head and gas canister to the table (follow instructions provided by the manufacturer).; , Make sure you can get to everything without reaching across the torch (even when off it will retain heat).  Take each one and rub firmly with wire wool. This cleans the metal and helps the bead release adhere to the surface.  Dip each mandrel in the bead release and leave to dry. Some bead releases can be dried in the flame; however, if yours does not say to do this, then leave to air dry, as it may crack otherwise.  Discard any mandrels with cracked bead release because if the glass comes in contact with the mandrel, it will stick and will likely be impossible to remove.  Bring up a lit match from underneath to light it.  A bushy flame means you have too much gas.  Take it into your dominant hand and, holding it horizontally, slowly wave it in and out of the flame just above the tip of the blue cone. If you heat the glass too quickly then it may "shock" or shatter. , Try to keep the glass in the flame and keep rotating and so that it doesn't droop or cool, warm the mandrel in the flame just behind the glass. Hold the mandrel horizontally. , At the same time, start rolling the mandrel slowly away from yourself.  The rest of the glass rod will slowly soften as you roll more onto the mandrel.  You will get a thin string of glass, just allow the flame to melt through it.   Place your glass rod onto the rod rest, out of the way.       You may want to switch your mandrel into your dominant hand at this point. To do this, carefully bring the mandrel in front of the torch. Never try reach over the flame.    Add any decoration or other colours.  Put the bead and mandrel in between two sheets of fiber blanket, or into a pot of vermiculite to cool. Be careful not to disturb the bead – if it cools too fast it may crack.   To check if your bead is cool enough to go into the fiber blanket or vermiculite without damaging it, hold the bead under your work area (don't forget to rotate) and see if it is still glowing – as soon as the glow fades, put it into the fiber blanket or vermiculite.  If you have trouble removing the bead, grip the mandrel with a pair of vise pliers and try to twist and pull the bead off.  Then scrub the inside with a bead reamer or a pipe cleaner. Now your bead is ready to use.   If wished, surface treatments such as etching can also be used at this point.	Set up your area. Arrange the rest of the equipment for easy access. Before you make a bead, prepare the mandrels. If a powdered bead release is to be used, mix it according to the manufacturer's instructions. When dry, check each mandrel to make sure that the coating is even and intact. Turn on the gas to your torch head. Adjust the flame until you have a sharp edged blue cone. Select the color of glass you want to start with. When the tip begins to glow, leave the glass in the flame a little longer, then start rotating the rod as a ball starts to form at the tip.  , When ready to start forming your bead, take the mandrel with your other hand. Carefully alter the position of the rod in your hand so that you are holding it like a pencil.  , Gently press the ball of molten glass through the flame and onto the mandrel. Stay in the flame. When you have added enough glass, pull away the glass rod (remember to keep the mandrel rotating in the flame). To round up your bead, keep the mandrel rotating in the flame until a smooth form is achieved. When finished, slowly remove the bead from the flame (remember to keep rotating) when the glow fades. When cool, soak the bead and mandrel in water to remove the bead release. Leave the bead to soak in water.

When an orchid refuses to bloom, the reason is usually because it isn't getting enough light. If you are unable to provide the right amount of natural light for your orchid, look into setting up full-spectrum lights indoors. You can purchase these lighting systems at nurseries or order them online.There are sizes and shapes available to fit any space in your home. You can adjust the lighting to meet the needs of your particular orchid species.  Feeding an orchid the right fertilizers can stimulate it to grow faster and bloom sooner.Look for orchid food that contains nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). It should also include trace elements like iron. Always read and follow the instructions of your orchid food carefully. Orchids should be watered thoroughly before fertilizing them.Some types of orchid food are granulated or dry. You must dissolve this kind of fertilizer in water before using. Dry orchid food is highly concentrated. Never use it directly on the plant. Once the granulated orchid food has been dissolved in water, pour it directly on the plant.  The active growing season for orchids is approximately March through November. Don’t fertilize from mid-December until mid-February. If you fertilize it less than that, its growth may become stunted and blooms won’t appear. If you fertilize it more frequently than that, you risk burning the roots and leaves of the plant. Burning an orchid’s roots with fertilizer will also prevent blooms from appearing.Read the instructions for your particular orchid food carefully, since they may vary slightly from product to product. Make sure you fertilize just after the flowers fade to stimulate additional blooms. Fertilize again when new leaves or shoots appear and begin growing.  Moth orchids (Phalaenopsis) are temperature sensitive. In nature, their blooms are triggered when fall arrives and the temperatures drop at night.If an orchid doesn’t experience a period of cooler nights, even an indoor orchid, it may refuse to make buds or bloom. If your orchid is sitting in a window, it’s probably experiencing natural temperature drops coming from outside to some extent. However, this may not be enough to trigger blooms. Before you go to bed each night, turn your thermostat down by 10 degrees.One to two weeks of nightly temperature drops will usually trigger an orchid to bloom, as long as it’s the right time of their growth cycle. For Phalaenopsis orchids, provide night temperatures of 60°F (15.5°C) and day temperatures of 80°F (25°C).  Stale, dry air will prevent an orchid from blooming. Orchids thrive in an environment where fresh, moist air circulates freely. While humidity is a necessity, it can also become destructively heavy if not ventilated well. Make sure the air around the orchid is fresh by opening windows or keeping a fan in the area on a low setting.	Consider using full-spectrum lights. Use a fertilizer formulated for orchids. Fertilize your orchid once per month during the active growing season. Drop the temperature by 10 degrees at night. Ventilate the area where your orchid is kept.
Amps have a designated power and impedance rating. This rating needs to match the load you put on your amp. A low quality or low power amp matched to high speakers would not take full advantage of the speakers quality. A too powerful amp will blow your speakers in a couple months., This can be done by disconnecting the battery ground cable. This will prevent injury or damage to your vehicle while working with wiring within the car.  This is important to get right. You want the amp to be somewhere where it can safely disperse heat. Otherwise, it will burn up and potentially start a fire. If you have an open trunk space that is usually ideal. Sometimes, another alternative is to put the amp under or behind seats, but be sure there is enough room for the amp to vent.  Using RCA cables is recommended for connecting the amp to the head unit, as they insulate the wire and dampen any distortion of the signal. It is also recommended that the cables be run on the side of the car opposite of the amp’s power wire to avoid signal interruptions that negatively  impact sound quality., The amp should be connected to a switched power supply. This way, power is only provided when the car is turned on. The power wire (also known as the remote turn on wire) will sometimes plug directly into your head unit. If not you will need to connect it to a switched power supply such as the head unit power supply or the ignition switch., You will need to connect the amp’s ground wire to another grounded wire or to any grounding point on the car. Grounding points are bare (clean, unpainted) metal surfaces. Be sure to do this somewhere that no one will incidentally touch it., There purpose of the amplifier is, after all, to amplify the signal coming from the head unit to fully utilize the speakers. You may have to cut the speaker wires from a spool of wire and strip enough insulation off of the end to fit into the amp’s terminals. Each wire should then be run to its corresponding speaker and connected to the speaker’s positive terminal., For all speakers wired in series, connect only the last speaker’s negative wire to the amp’s negative terminal. For all speakers wired in parallel, connect the negative wire of each speaker to the amp’s negative terminal.	Match your amplifier (amp) to the speaker load of your system. Kill power to your car’s electrical system. Find a home for your amp. Wire the amp to the head unit. Power your amp. Ground the amp. Connect the positive terminal your amp to your speakers. Connect the negative terminal of your amp to your speakers.
Wheat paste is an excellent glue to use in paper-based crafts.  Wheat paste is strong enough to support three dimensional sculptures as well, although you should mix in glue or sugar if your batch comes out too weak.  Many bookbinders prefer homemade paste to store bought glue, or use a mix of paste and specialized "PVA glue".          Some bookbinders recommend using starch powder rather than flour to create a more transparent paste.	Decorate an Object using Decoupage. Create Sculptures from Waste Paper. Repair a Book's Binding.
Rooting compound, also referred to as rooting hormones, is comprised of synthetic auxins that encourage embryonic root development. Most compounds also include small amounts of fungicide to help prevent disease while the cutting is rooting. The compound is available in a powdered form at most garden centers.   Shake a small amount (about 2 to 3 tablespoons or 30 to 45 ml) of rotting compound onto a paper plate. Dip the lower part of the stem into the compound and then lightly shake off the excess. Apply root compound conservatively; too high of levels may inhibit growth development as the plant matures.  Cuttings can be rooted in any container with drainage holes. You can root the cuttings in individual pots, or in a flat that contains several 2- or 3-inch (5- or 7.6-cm) cells.  The rooting medium should provide a mix of moisture and air so that the cutting is supported, but root growth is not restricted. The most popular rooting medium is a mix of garden soil, peat moss, perlite, turface, vermiculite, and hardwood or pine bark. Commercial blends are available at most garden centers.  Fill the container about three-quarters full of rooting medium. Place the container in a pan of water and let it sit until the top of the rooting medium appears moist. Then allow the container to drain for 10 minutes.  Poke a hole in the rooting medium a little larger than the stem using a pencil or straw. The pre-formed holes allow the rooting compound to stay on the cutting, rather than being brushed off onto the top of the soil. Then insert, or "stick" the cuttings into the rooting medium. The lower parts should be firmly supported by the rooting medium, and should not be touching the bottom of the container.  If you are planting different kinds of herbs, label each pot or flat with the name of the herb and the planting date.	Apply rooting compound. Select rooting containers. Prepare the rooting medium. Prepare the container. Stick the cuttings. Label the pots and/or flats.

Clean the bowls, the jets and passages, the rubber diaphragms under the top lid have no holes, and your carb needles, as well as the floats are hung in the right positions, as indicated by the workshop manual for your machine. Check the rubber manifolds for leaks, and make sure your idle mixture screws are adjusted to the indicated number of turns. Your bike should now idle somewhat peacefully.  Twist the idle mixture screw on each carb - you will notice that the engine idles faster or slower. The spot where it idles fastest is the right one, find that on all the carbs, all the while re-adjusting your main idle to the revs indicated in your manual, usually a bit less than 1000 rpm on a 4-cylinder. Congratulations, you have adjusted and synchronized the idle speed!; , Attach the hoses from the vacuum gauges, and start the engine. Preferably, it is already warmed up., You will have noticed the indicating needles on the gauges going up when you open the throttle, and fluttering like mad when idling. First, let's take care of the fluttering.  Every clock has a little screw, where the tube gets in or nearby. Twist that until the fluttering calms, but does not stop completely. Gun the engine in between adjusting, until all the needles on the clocks are fluttering somewhat calmly at idle. Open her up, and see those needles rise... to quite different places on the clock. Your next step will be to make them rise in unison.  Depending on your bike, you might have one carb that cannot be adjusted: that is the one to which the others have to be adjusted to.  Loosen or tighten those screws, bit by bit, opening up the throttle in between, until all the needles on the gauges rise and fall simultaneously, in perfect harmony. This does take its time, and can be a bit frustrating, not to mention noisy. Patience and perseverance does it!  , You have successfully synchronized your carbs! However, if your machine, and her carbs, is old and worn, you might never get those needles to behave like a well trained dance troupe. For all those that just want to keep the old beater running, preferably at a tolerable pace, there is a second way of adjusting it.	Make sure your carbs are clean and in perfect working order. Pull off the little rubber covers, or screws, that hold the vacuum passage shut on each carb. Open and close the throttle a few times, then let her idle. Loosen the countering nuts on the butterfly valve adjusting screw of each carb. Once you have acquired that, and have also tightened the countering nuts, and the needles are still in perfect synchronicity, voila!
If your case just covers the back, the alcohol can damage the screen. If your case covers the entire iPod, you can leave it on.  You want a hand sanitizer without the cleansing beads, as they can embed themselves in inopportune places such as speaker holes., Squeeze a liberal amount of hand sanitizer onto the iPod case., Using your hands or a non-paper cloth, rub the hand sanitizer into the case. Your hand/cloth will spread the hand sanitizer across the case, sanitizing it., For a deeper clean, use a cotton swab to clean the crevasses of the case., Some hand sanitizer may have remained on the case. As hand sanitizer is corrosive and may damage the sensitive electronics, be sure to dry the case before putting it back on. Leaving it out will let the alcohol evaporate, removing all wetness., Your iPod case is now clean! Cleaning often is recommended as iPods, being used everyday, are exposed to the same microorganisms that live on your hand. You wash your hands dozens of times a day, why now wash your case?	Remove the case. Choose hand sanitizer. Apply hand sanitizer. Clean the case. Deep cleaning. Dry the case. Re-install the case.
If you live in a rainy environment or frequently ride on wet, muddy trails, go for a wet chain lube. It's thicker, so heavy downpours and mud won't wash it away. If you live in a drier climate, choose a thinner chain lube marked for dry conditions.You can find wet and dry bicycle lubricants online or at a bike shop. Make sure to use only lubricants marked for bicycles. If you frequently use your bike in both wet and dry conditions, buy one of each lube.; , It’s best to thoroughly clean your bike’s chain before you lubricate it.Spray a clean rag with a bicycle degreaser or WD-40. With the bike in a work stand or propped up, grasp the chain with the soaked rag and use your hand to pedal the chain through the rag.Pedal the chain through the rag until each of the chain’s links have passed through the cleaning rag two or three times. Repeat the technique with another clean rag to wipe away excess residue and dry the chain. Note that while some manufacturers advise using WD-40 as a cleaning solution, it’s not a proper lubricant on its own.  Touch the lubricant container’s straw nozzle to one side (either the inside of the chain closest to the frame or the outside) of the top of the bike chain. Spin the pedals forward to move each of the chain’s links past the lubricating nozzle. Once you’ve spun the chain in two complete rotations, repeat the process on the other side of the chain’s top.Try not to apply too much lube as you pedal the chain. A little goes a long way, so just apply a thin stream. Wiping away excess will help make sure you cover the nooks and crannies.  Use a similar procedure to lube both sides of the chain’s bottom. Touch the nozzle to the inner and outer sides of the chain, and rotate the chain twice for each side. Pedal backward when you lube the bottom of the chain, instead of pedaling forward as you did with the top side., You’ll need to get rid of excess lubricant after you’ve lubed the inner and outer edges of the chain’s top and bottom. Grasp the chain with a clean, dry rag and pedal forward to move the chain through the rag. Continue for two or three rotations, or until you’ve wiped away all the excess surface lube.Wiping away the excess surface lube will help reduce dirt and debris from caking up your chain.	Choose a wet lube if you ride in the rain. Clean and dry the chain before lubricating it. Lube the top of the chain. Lube the bottom of the chain. Wipe away excess lubricant.
It is good to have at least some knowledge about gold coins when buying and selling. The standard weight for a gold coin is one Troy ounce (31.1 grams, a little heavier than the standard ounce). There are coins that weigh less than one Troy ounce (1ozt), but they trade less frequently, and you will pay a bigger percentage premium to buy them from dealers. That will cut into your potential profits. , The Troy ounce is used because a standard measurement system is needed since gold is an important, universal material. The difference between the two measurements matters more as you buy more gold. For example, a 100 Troy ounce bar of gold is not the same as 100 ounces of sugar. You would be losing 8.85 Troy ounces of gold. Calculate carefully., Gold coins can be segregated into various types. The two main types are bullion and numismatic. Bullion coins are more commonly acquired by gold investors because the prices are transparent. The price of gold depends on the market price of physical investment grade gold.The most common bullion coins are American Gold Eagles and Canadian Maple Leafs. Bullion gold coins of today usually have 90% or higher level of gold content and are 22k to 24k.  Numismatic coins are most often purchased by gold collectors. The price of this gold coin is more dependent on outside factors, like rarity of coin, than market price. Rare collectible numismatic coins can sell at a very high premium--more than the gold value alone. Most of the buyers and sellers of numismatic gold coins have decades of experience. It is not recommended for beginners.A few examples of numismatic coins are British Sovereigns, 20 Swiss Francs, and $10 Eagle coins.Bullion coins are made year-to-year. Numismatic coins are not produced in modern times.  Gold is sometimes traded in hard times for things like cigarettes and shoes, but it won’t get you by in a time of crisis. This is because gold loses its value in times of crisis. Gold is not stable, and it is actually a commodity because it is a metal. Gold is, however, a good investment if you follow the market, carefully choose the type of coins you buy, and don’t solely rely on it for financial insurance.As the value of money falls, the value of nominal gold rises and vice-versa. You should also consider investing in silver if you are looking for something to fall back on during hard times., You should check the price of gold the day you plan to buy. Don’t pay more than a 5% to 8% markup on the price, based on what the price is that day. A small markup is normal because the extra cost typically covers the price of minting and shipping, the dealer, and the authorized purchaser.You can check the current price of gold on websites like www.goldprice.org  , Look into extraneous fees and the validity of the company you are buying from before making a purchase. You should look into fees like shipping costs, hidden commission, insurance fees, or extra charges due to payment type. Use your judgment and compare with other vendors to make sure you’re not being overcharged., It is important to buy from a legitimate vendor when purchasing gold. Research the business you plan to buy from on websites like Better Business Bureau and RipOffReport.com The vendor should have many positive peer reviews, and a generally good rating.Before buying, you should also check to see if the vendor will buy back the gold coins, and if they will give you a fair price in years to come.  There are many ways you can buy gold coins. You can buy from the government, online, or from a local retailer. Your best bet is to compare prices on whichever coin you're thinking of buying.  Their coins usually come with a reliable guarantee of gold content, weight, and purity. The variety of coins may be limited, but you can feel safe buying from the government. Buying from the government, however, may not be the best option if you are looking for old and/or rare coins.The US government sells gold coins online at usmint.gov  , There are numerous websites to buy coins from online, like ebay.com and goldsilver.com. Because there are so many sites out there, be sure to check every website out before considering a purchase. Most retail sites offer multiple methods of purchase, like PayPal, credit card, money orders, and checks.Don’t jump on the lowest price. The vendor with the lowest price may not be the one that provides the best quality of purchase.  You can buy locally from a jewelry shop or pawn shop. This is the riskiest route, however. Some dealers make shady guarantees in order to trick buyers into purchasing their coins. Try to obtain a price guarantee (a specific value guarantee that the dealer places on your coin). If buying within your state, check the United States Mint website for a list of reputable dealers by state.Go to www.usmint.gov to check by state. The US Mint checks the dealers, but does not vouch for them.  If you want to buy coins below market value, like the dealers do, learn how to buy coins from the public. You can do this by looking through yard sales and buying online from websites like eBay. Make sure you do so legally though. Avoid soliciting others for their gold., Make sure the coins are real soon after you make your purchase. One of the most important things you can do to minimize your losses is make sure the coins are made from real gold without damaging them. You can do this by testing things like the weight, sound, and acidity.Gold is a dense metal. Even if the coin weighs what it should, check the diameter and thickness. Sometimes fake coins will make up for weight by a thicker diameter and thickness. Or, they will be underweight to make up for the size. Check the weight and thickness by using a jeweler’s scale and calipers. Strike the gold coin with another coin. It should chime. Base metals will sound duller, and the sound will not last as long. Buy an acid test to see if the gold coin is genuine. Do not overdo this because the test can cause permanent damage to the coin. You check the quality by rubbing the gold on a black stone, which will leave a mark. You then apply nitric acid to the coin. Any mark that is not gold should dissolve. Have a third party certified coin dealer verify they are real.  Any secure method of storage is going to cost you money. Consider a bank safe deposit box, a home safe, or a safekeeping program offered by some gold dealers. This mainly concerns investors, though. You will keep the coins on hand, in a lock box, or safe temporarily if you plan to resell them for a quick profit., It is just as important to know the price of gold when you’re selling as it is when you’re buying. Most newspapers report the price of gold daily, and you can get almost instantaneous updates online at several sites. Don’t sell the gold immediately unless the type of coin you have is doing very well. Check the site often and sell when the coin is doing well, or when you really need it.Keep track of the price www.goldprice.org Even if the coin is doing particularly well, it is wise to wait years before selling certain coins.  This is also widely reported. As mentioned, there tends to be an inverse relationship between that and the value of gold. It is best not to sell when the currency for your country is doing very well. Instead, wait for the currency to decline in value., This is where both research and intuition steps in. You want to sell your coins right before the value of gold starts going down, so that you walk away from the transaction with more money than you spent on the coins. Since timing the market does not always work, you should consider selling when the price of gold is at all time high, the demand is very high, the sentiment is generally bullish, and you are sitting at a sizeable profit.No matter what the reports say and how the market is doing, the choice to sell is ultimately up to you.  It is an option to sell directly to a jeweler or pawn shop, but you should make a trip to either or both places no matter where you sell. Look for a reputable jeweler or pawn shop, take your gold coins to them, and ask to have an estimate to assess their value. Use that value as the base of what you charge, whether it is online, like on eBay, to an individual, or to a retailer.Go to three or four shops for estimations.  Rogue buyers are those who come to town, set up in places like a hotel ballroom, and disappear without paying. These buyers will make false promises to buy for high prices, but will actually pay for less than what the gold is worth. For example, a piece of gold appraised for $250 may only get an offer of $130 from a rogue buyer.Stick to selling to retailers approved by the Better Business Bureau to assure that you are not being cheated.	Learn about coin weight. Pay attention to the difference between ounce and Troy ounce. Look into bullion coins. Learn about numismatic coins. Do not rely on gold as insurance during a crisis. Avoid overpaying. Notice the fees. Look up the business. Shop around. Buy from the government. Buy from an online site. Buy from an individual dealer. Buy coins from people. Inspect the coins. Plan where you will store the coins. Keep track of gold value. Keep track of the value of your country's currency. Aim to sell your coins at the peak of demand. Take your gold coin to a jeweler or pawn shop. Do not sell to “rogue” buyers.
Check the fabric content to see what kind of maintenance it will require in order to stay looking good. For everyday use, you will probably want something that is washable and requires little ironing.          Rather than purchase fabric, look around in your scraps. This is a great project for using up leftovers or recycling old fabrics. Especially if you are making hankies for everyday use, try old bandannas or pillowcases for the fabric. The advantage is, you will already know how the fabric behaves and holds up.; ,,          Typically, a man's handkerchief is 12x12 inches (about 30cm) square. A woman's is 8x8 (22cm) square, but since you are making your own, you may make it any size you prefer. Using a sharp pair of scissors, cut the square(s). ,,,,	Purchase the fabric. Wash and/or dry the fabric according to the manufacturer's instructions (before you make the handkerchief), and press.         , Using a ruler, measure and mark on your fabric the size handkerchief you want to make, plus two inches (5cm). Fold the edge over 1/2 inch (about 12mm) and press.         , Fold over another 1/2 inch (about 12mm) and press.         , Using your sewing machine, stitch the edge all the way around.         , Iron and fold.         , Finished.
Depending on where you're submitting, you will need to be able to send in your music on a physical CD or electronically through a digital format such as MP3.   For CD distribution, you usually don't need fancy packaging or elaborate press kits. In fact, many radio stations will request that you not send in materials like this. Some musicians insist that a plain silver CD-R with your name and the song title, accompanied by a track listing in a clear plastic case, is all you need. Whatever packaging you choose, make sure all your information is clear, complete, concise, and correct. You don't want a music director to fall in love with your song only to be unable to figure out who it belongs to!; , Some radio stations may accept email attachments, but more often if they accept electronic submissions they will want a link to an online source for your music. You have many options for digital distribution.   If you want your music more publicly available, you can use services such as iTunes, Amazon Music, or Bandcamp. iTunes allows you to sign up to sell your music for free;Amazon Music requires you to use a distributor to sell your music through their Digital Music store.Bandcamp is also free to sign up and is becoming increasingly popular with artists.Examine several options and choose the best for your situation. You can also get your music online by using websites such as YouTube or Vimeo. Read the Terms and Conditions for any website carefully; you want to make sure you keep your copyright and permission to sell your music! Sites such as Soundcloud, Mediafire, and Sendspace operate legal file sharing services that allow music directors to download your music without having to worry about viruses and other safety issues., You may or may not be requested to submit a press kit with your music. However, it doesn't hurt to have one ready to go. Most press kits include several basic elements that will help people get to know you quickly.   Write a cover letter. This should be addressed to the person to whom you're submitting your music. Include your contact information, any webpages (YouTube, Facebook, website, etc.) that you have, and basic information about your music (genre, themes, etc.). Write a short biography. This should be a short description of you (or your band, if you have one) and your accomplishments so far. You can talk about your influences and interests here, but keep this part story-oriented. Consider it like your introduction to a new friend.Create a "fact sheet." This should include the essential information about you: name, style of music, other artists/bands you are similar to, instrumentation, etc.  The genre of music you play will help to determine the radio stations that are likely to play your song. For example, public radio stations (such as local National Public Radio affiliates) tend to focus on indie, jazz, and singer-songwriter types.Your local college radio station may be a good choice for music that draws a younger audience, such as rap, hip-hop, and rock.Make sure you send your song to a station that's shown they play that type of music.  You're probably going to need to start small, especially if you haven't signed with a record label yet. College radio stations are excellent places to get your start, because they tend to be open to playing new and less mainstream music. They also tend to be less driven by advertising and business concerns than commercial radio, so they might be more willing to take a chance on your song.However, commercial radio stations may also be interested in your music, especially if you're a local act, so check out the websites for the stations in your area.   You can find radio station locators on the internet. These will allow you to search by state, city, or country.Look for titles like "music director," "station manager," "production manager," or "DJ." These are usually the people in charge of receiving, selecting, and playing new music. If you're not sure whom to contact, try calling the station's general information line and asking to be connected to the person in charge of music programming. You can also call in to the station during a specific program: often, DJs answer the phone during their programs and you can ask them about getting your song on air. This works particularly well if you call a show focusing on the genre of music you make., Internet radio is still broadcast radio's younger cousin, but it's another venue for emerging artists. Many internet radio stations allow -- even welcome! -- submissions from musicians who are new on the scene.   Pandora allows direct submissions.AmazingRadio.com is another online station that accepts independent and emerging artists.Live365.com will host your music in their Music Library, which will allow their online stations access to it.  Many DJs and radio stations have social media accounts now. Follow them on Twitter and Facebook and check out their blogs and playlists. You'll have a better chance of personalizing your submission if you know who you're sending your song to.   You can also reach out to radio stations and DJs through social media. A tweet to them about your music will get your name out there without seeming overly aggressive.  Submission guidelines vary widely, depending on where you're submitting your music. In general, though, music on CD seems to be the preferred submission method. Few places will accept a digital file sent as an email attachment.   If the radio station's website provides specific guidelines, follow them! Nothing will turn off staff faster than you not following their directions. Many stations will discard music without listening to it if it isn't submitted properly. If you can't find information about submitting your music online, contact the station with your inquiry directly. Send a short, friendly email explaining who you are, your musical experiences, and what your song is about. If you have a YouTube, Facebook, or other media page, include a link. Don't send any attachments; many places won't open email attachments because of security and virus concerns.  A personalized submission is far more likely to catch a music director or DJ's eye than a form email that's clearly been sent to 500 other stations.   This also goes for physical CD submissions. Whenever possible, customize your submission using people's names (if you can find them) and a brief statement of why you fit in with their station's "feel."  , Once you've established the guidelines for submitting your music, send it in! Give complete information -- your contact info and the CD's track listing are essential -- but don't send anything that isn't asked for.  It can take days, weeks, or even months for your song to make it into the hands of a music director, especially if you've sent it to a larger station. Don't harass people with calls or emails. Remember, they get many submissions from hopeful artists just like you, and it takes awhile to listen to everything.   The radio station may give a time-frame for responding to you. If it's past that time-frame, a friendly email inquiry is appropriate, but try not to sound accusative or angry. A simple email asking if the music director has had time to listen to your submission yet will suffice.  It's always awesome when an artist gets a big break, but there are many artists and bands out there and only so much radio space. You may be rejected from the first several stations you contact, and that's okay. Be persistent and patient. Being rejected doesn't mean your music is bad!	Prepare your music for distribution. Make your music easily shareable online. Compose a press kit. Determine your radio options. Research your local stations. Consider alternative radio. Make connections. Read guidelines carefully. Customize your submissions. Send in your music. Wait. Prepare for rejection.
Define your fitness or weight loss goals and go from there. Defining your goals will help you to find out what types of equipment do you need. If your main goal is to build or pump your muscles, then you will need some strength training equipment. If you want to lose some weight, then you will need to look for cardio training equipment. If you want to build a fully functional home gym, then you will need both types of equipment. Whatever you decide, please do not forget to check the size of the equipment, as it has to fit in your home gym room.      ; , Vinyl or rubber tiles are best in a home gym. These tiles cushion the impact on the joints during high intensity workouts. If vinyl or rubber tiles are not an option, carpet or laminate flooring works also. However, home gym equipment is heavy, so if you decide to put carpet or laminate, be aware that it can be damaged. Also, some equipment can slide on laminate floors during high intensity workouts, and you have to prevent that. Be sure to either protect the floor, or find something to put underneath the equipment. Home gym mats are a good option for this.  Colors in a home gym should be energizing, bright and colorful. And think about the size of your home gym. If your home gym is in a small space, dark colors are not recommended. Putting dark colors here makes that space seem like more of a dungeon than a fun home gym. Also, take into consideration what type of exercises are being done in that certain space. For example, if this room is going to mainly be used for weightlifting, consider a blue hue. Tranquil blues send a chemical from the brain to the rest of the body calming or soothing it. Weight Lifters lift more in a blue room. Blue is also known to increase productivity and suppress an appetite.  Putting up pictures of your family may be something to keep you going. Family can be one of the most inspiring things to a person. Anything that is considered inspiring should be in your home gym. This is to be a place of inspiration and hard work. Find something that inspires you to work harder.  Write inspirational sayings and put them up on a wall or mirror; somewhere where they will be seen and inspire. Make it personal as well, adding goals on a whiteboard or a piece of paper taped up on a wall. Perhaps add a stereo or television to your home gym. If there is something distracting enough to take one’s mind off a workout, that workout might become easier or might pass by faster causing them to continue. Hydration is another important part of working out, so perhaps adding a small refrigerator stocked with bottled water or sports drinks would be a good idea. Also, adding clock to your home gym can help keep track of workout times.       Do not create a home gym alone. Bringing in family is a great way to get everyone involved and may encourage the rest of the family to get fit, stay active and spend more time together. If small children are part of the equation, then add a set, specifically made space just for them, so then they can work out alongside their family. Friends are another great group to get involved. Working out with friends is a great motivation tool for workouts. Friends encourage each other to push one’s limits. Perhaps even get everyone to join as a team for a competition, such as, an obstacle course, triathlon, or group running. The most important thing to remember is to have fun creating this home gym. It should not be a grueling process; it should be fun and exciting.	Choose the right equipment   Before decorating, take into consideration what type of workouts will be pursued there. Choose the right flooring   A home gym would not be complete without proper flooring. Choose the right colors   A bright, happy room full of colors is more encouraging, than a gloomy, colorless room full of gym equipment. Personalize your home gym room   Bring in plants, candles, motivational posters or pictures of your family. Other Décor Ideas for Your Home Gym  It may be an option to put a mirror on the wall to watch themselves improve as they work out. Finished.
Straighten out a wire coat hanger and use it to fish out hair and dirt from the drain that is clogged.          Try not to push the debris further down into the pipe. The goal is to drag out whatever is causing the clog.; , Place the vacuum on the wet setting so it is safe to vacuum liquids.          Cover the vacuum vent. If you do not, there could be spray or mess created by whatever comes out of the drain. Seal the drain. Use a piece of rubber or something like a plunger head that will force the liquid that leaves the drain to go directly into the vacuum. Turn the vacuum on its highest setting and hold it over the clogged drain. The force of the vacuum will bring the clog up from the drain and into the vacuum.  Hold a toilet plunger over the clogged drain and press down, allowing the plunger to suction back up.          Remove the plunger from over the drain after you press down on it 4 or 5 times. See if you brought anything up. If you did, clean it away from the drain and if you did not, try plunging again.	Snake the drain with a hanger. Try a wet/dry vacuum on the drain. Plunge the drain.
For example, you may have to take the highway when you are used to driving on residential streets. You can relax when driving in new situations if you remain confident in your driving ability.   Remember that you know the basic rules of driving and that they are generally the same, regardless of the situation. You might say to yourself, “This is a new situation, but I’m a safe driver and can handle this.” For example, if you are driving in a construction zone for the first time, you might remind yourself, “I can do this. I’m confident in my driving ability.”  , At some time or another you will likely have to drive when it is raining, snowing, or very windy. You can relax when you are driving in bad weather, however, if you stay alert and drive with caution.If the weather is very bad, for example, there are high winds and hail, try to avoid driving at all. Make sure your headlights, brake lights, and windshield wipers are working before you leave. Reduce your speed so that you can have time to react to anything that comes up when you are driving. Pay attention and look for road hazards like fallen tree branches or flooding roadways.  You can relax when you are driving at night if make sure that you are focused and paying attention to what is going on around you.Look out for motorists and pedestrians that may be hard to see at night. Use your mirrors often and look around ahead of you. Make sure your headlights are on and that your brake lights work before you start driving. Don’t drive when you are tired or sleepy.  There will be times when, no matter how hard you try, you end up running late. Instead of getting nervous and trying to rush to get there, notify the appropriate person you will be late and accept it. This will help you relax when driving much more than trying to beat red lights to save a few seconds on your driving time.   For instance, if an accident on the interstate is making you late for work, instead of getting frustrated, call your supervisor and let her know. You might say, “I wanted to let you know that I am on the way, I’m just running a few minutes late because of an accident.”  , When the kids are making a ruckus in the back seat or your mom is being a backseat driver, it can be very distracting and upsetting. You can relax when you are driving if you ask them not to distract you before you begin driving. If you are already driving, calmly, but firmly tell them to stop.   For instance, you might say, “Kids, when I start driving you have to sit back and talk quietly. This will keep me calm and all of us safe.” For example, you can say, “Mom, I appreciate your concern, but you telling me how to drive is making me nervous. Please stop.” If you need to, pull over until the distraction stops. This will keep you calm and safe.  Although other drivers may do things that upset, frustrate, or even scare you like cutting you off, following too close, swerving, or even showing road rage, stay calm.Allowing rude drivers to upset you will prevent you from relaxing while driving.   Avoid making rude gestures or even eye contact with other motorists. This could escalate the situation unnecessarily. When possible, change your rate of speed slightly so you can get away from the immediate area of the other driver. If you feel threatened, roll up your windows and lock your doors. Call 911 if you think the situation may get violent.	Be confident when driving in new situations.You may find yourself in a situation where you have to drive in conditions you aren’t used to. Use caution in inclement weather. Be alert when driving at night. Accept it when you are running late. Stop other people in the car from distracting you. Stay calm around rude drivers.
You will need this extra length for the hem. If your skirt has a lining, and you need to hem it as well, plan on having it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the finished skirt., Consider using a hem gauge to measure upward from the hem while you draw the line. This will ensure that you will be cutting an equal amount off all around the skirt. If you don't have a hem gauge, you can use a ruler or measuring tape instead.  If your skirt has a lining, cut the lining 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter.  Be sure that you are folding towards the wrong size of the fabric (inside the skirt). If you have a serger, or if your serving machine has an overlock stitch, you can skip the folding and use that instead. When you are done, remove the sewing pins.  If you are sewing a skirt lining, fold it down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) instead.Keep the pins in place.  Try to get as close to the folded edge as you can. About 1         Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric. This is ideal for those who are working with skirt linings and thinner materials.  Thread a needle, and tie a knot at the end of the thread. Use the needle to pull the thread through the hem. Catch 1 to 2 threads from the skirt material, then bring the needle back into the hem. Pull the needle ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) through the hem, then use it to catch 1 to 2 threads from the skirt material again. Keep blind stitching until the hem is all sewn up. Knot the end of the thread, and snip the rest off.Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric. This is great for those working with a heavier or thicker material.  After this, your skirt is now ready to wear.	Decide how long you want the skirt to be, and add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to it. Draw a line across the skirt where you need to cut it using dressmaker's chalk. Cut the excess fabric off using fabric scissors, using the line you drew as a guide. Fold the hem down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), secure it with sewing pins, then press it with an iron. Fold the hem down by another 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters), secure it with sewing pins, then press it flat with an iron again. Consider sewing the hem down using a sewing machine. Consider blind stitching the hem. Press the hem down with an iron one final time.
Examine what takes up your spare time, when you have it. Do you enjoy reading books? Maybe you want to try your hand at writing them. Do you like a cold beer at the end of the day? Maybe your hobby could be trying to brew beer at home. Turn what you already love into a hobby.; , What traits do you prize? Do you value wisdom or courage? Do you feel drawn to people who give back? Do you admire artistic expression? Let those traits guide you when choosing a hobby.   For instance, maybe you could volunteer at a library as a hobby because you value education, or maybe you could take up painting because you admire people who can express themselves with art.  Certain hobbies require certain skill sets.   If you don't have a great deal of patience, then maybe hand sewing isn't something you'd enjoy. However, if you love tinkering and building things, maybe you should consider a hobby like working on older cars or building furniture. Play to your strengths., The way you talk about issues can also reveal your passions and those passions can be developed into a hobby.   Think about the topics you go on endlessly about. Ask your friends and family what you seem to talk about the most. Now, think about what it is about that subject that you enjoy so much and determine how it can be transformed into a hobby. For instance, maybe you are passionate about local politics, and getting involved at a grassroots level could become your hobby.	Look at what interests you. Think about what you value most. Examine your skills and personality. Pay attention to what excites your passion.
You'll find the magnet sensors of most alarms on the windows and doors of your home. You'll want to choose a door or window that's easy to access and escape through. For windows, you'll also want to consider your path after you exit.   Second story windows can be difficult to safely get down from without extra tools, like a ladder. Because of this, these windows should be avoided.If you plan to leave through a window, your best choice may be one that's ground level and roughly chest height.; , Generally, magnet sensors will look like a small metal box. In some cases, this may have exposed pieces of magnet, which are usually dark in color. The sensor will have two parts. One will be stationary, and the other will be attached to the movable part of your door or window.   When the magnetic bond between the fixed and movable parts of the sensor is broken, the alarm will be activated. Magnet sensors are almost always placed on the frame of the door or window at the top, bottom, or one of the sides., You should be careful when attempting this, as some sensors are higher quality than others and this technique may not always work. However, in some cases, you may be able to place a fridge magnet on the sensor to trick it into thinking the door or window is closed even when open.For more sophisticated magnet sensors, you may need to use tools, like a screwdriver, to remove the movable part of the sensor on the door or window. Then, place it onto the stationary sensor to make it think the window is still closed. Before you remove any parts of the sensor, you might first want to take a picture of it with your cell phone. This way, you'll have a reference photo if you have to put it back together later. You may be able to check whether or not your fridge magnet works by applying it to the sensor and running a check on your security system, if that feature is available. If the sensor reads as closed when the fridge magnet is in place and the window open, this technique should work.  After you come back, you'll want to re-engage your alarm to prevent burglars from using your temporary escape route. To do this, simply return your door or window to the fully closed position and remove the magnet you used to trick the sensor.   If you removed the movable part of the sensor because your system was more sophisticated, all you have to do is refasten that part into place. If you have difficulty remembering how to reinstall the mechanism, consult the picture you took earlier.	Identify your ideal escape route. Inspect the alarm mechanism to verify it's magnetic. Use a magnet to bypass the sensor. Return the door or window to normal.
To open the bag, Cut with scissors along the top of the paper.   Keep the thickness in mind as you pour in the concrete mix––the stool cannot be too thick or it may be top heavy and topple over (especially if you're making a tall stool). Filling to about a third or quarter of the bucket should be ample for a good stool. Unused powdered concrete mixture should be tightly sealed and kept in a dry, cool place where moisture cannot get to it.; , It’s better to slowly add and mix water into concrete, so if hosing in the water, use a carefully controlled nozzle to ensure a slow addition of water rather than a fierce blast.  As you pour the water into the concrete, use a sturdy stick or paint stirrer to combine the mixture into a smooth paste.   Also follow any instructions provided on the concrete packaging.	Scoop some concrete mix from the bag into the bucket mold. Fill a large pitcher with water to mix with the concrete. Slowly pour the water into the dry concrete.
The different types of paints used on automobiles are Acrylic Lacquer, Acrylic Enamel, and Urethane based paints.; , A thorough wash and dry is very important to allow the wax to be applied smoothly.  Use the wax if your black paint has hairline scratches or other minor blemishes or if it needs its shine restored. Colored wax can restore the shine of fading paint only if the paint is oxidized.  Use a damp terry cloth or cheesecloth, and squeeze or scoop out a small amount of wax onto your cloth. Apply the wax with moderate pressure, and use circular motions that overlap. Moderate pressure ensures that the wax can get fully worked into scratches and other blemishes.  This ensures that all the excess wax is removed and the new shine is revealed.  Apply in circular motions with moderate pressure.	Find out which type of black paint your car has, and buy a cleaner that is designed specifically for your car's type of paint. Wash and dry your black car before you begin waxing. Purchase black car wax. Apply black car wax by hand. Buff out the recently applied wax after it has dried to a glaze. Use a lamb's wool buffing pad to buff an extra dose of "wet look" shine if the previous step didn't create a shine that satisfies you.
Once you have selected and created a pattern, trace the pattern onto the felt that you will be using to make the ornament. In order to trace the pattern onto the felt, you will need to use an iron-on transfer pen. To use this pen, print out the pattern and then trace over the design directly on the paper. Once complete, flip over the paper and place the ink directly on the felt. Iron the paper on the felt. This will transfer the ink onto the felt., In order to cut out the pattern, make sure that you are cutting two pieces of felt that are the exact same size. Try folding the felt in half with the pattern side facing up. This way you can cut both pieces at the same time. This will ensure they are the exact same shape and size. Carefully and slowly cut along the pattern.   To navigate sharp corners, stop cutting, take the scissors off the material, and change directions. Then begin cutting again, facing in a new direction.  Depending on the ornament you are making, you may want to stitch on some added details. For example, if you are making a snowman you may want to stitch on eyes or a mouth. Stitch these details only onto one of the pieces that you have cut out.   This will vary depending on the ornament and is not always necessary. If you are not comfortable with more complex stitching, you can glue on details afterwards.  In order to sew the ornament together, you need to layer the two pieces of felt, with the good sides facing inwards. The good sides are the sides of the felt that you want to be visible once the ornament is complete. Measure and sew a ⅛ inch seam around the ornament, leaving a 1 ½ inch opening. Typically you should leave the opening at the bottom of the ornament, but depending on the shape you may need to leave an opening along the side. Once you are finished sewing, turn it inside out, so that the good sides are facing outwards.Alternatively, you can sew the ornament together with the sides you want to be visible facing out using a blanket stitch. You will still need to leave an opening at the bottom in order to fill the ornament with stuffing.  When you sew the ornament closed, you should add a looped ribbon for hanging. Loop a small ribbon and position it between the two pieces of fabric at the top of the ornament. When you sew the ornament closed sew through both pieces of felt, as well as the ribbon. This will secure the ribbon and allow the ornament to hang.  Stuff the ornament with polyester fiberfill. Insert the filling through the opening that you left at the bottom of the ornament. This will give the ornament depth. Once filled, stitch the opening closed.	Trace the pattern onto the felt. Cut out the pattern. Stitch on any details. Sew the ornament. Add a ribbon for hanging the ornament. Stuff and seal the ornament.
Medium-weight soil holds water better than light soil. Lightweight soil may become too dry to support the plant when exposed to the sun for long periods of time.Soil weight will be listed on the bag you purchase.  If the soil is too heavy, it may become soggy and harm the plant.Re-pot a plant rooted in extremely light, airy soil when you get it home from the store, even if it is a hanging plant or a shade plant. Extremely light soil, composed of peat and sphagnum moss, dries out quickly and may kill your plant., It may be too compacted for your potted plant and won't allow air to get to the roots. Heavy soil also may have too much sand, which retains few nutrients, and may drain poorly, which can cause plant roots to rot.Use a sandier soil when planting desert plants. It should provide better drainage and contain fewer nutrients than the potting mix you use for most other plants. This will allow the plants to flourish.	Select medium-weight potting soil for plants that are exposed to full sunlight. Use lighter soil for hanging plants or for plants that grow in the shade. Avoid using heavy soil.
Pedal starting is useful for starting a struggling engine and moving from a stop. Get the key in place. Turn it to the right until it clicks to show that the ignition has been engaged. Do this before you start pedaling so you don’t have to fumble with the key.  Work the pedals like you would a bicycle. Release the kickstand and push forward to get a little momentum. Pedaling will be a little difficult because of the weight of the moped, but keep going until the starting process is complete., Find the start button on your moped. It may be a red button near the right handlebar or a lever on the left handlebar. Some vehicles may also have a kickstart lever on one of the wheels that you can hit with your foot instead. Use this to start the motor.   Since you’re already moving, don’t hit the brakes.  Locate the throttle. It is likely on the right handlebar. Lay your palm flat on the throttle, then gently turn it towards you. This opens the throttle as you move, allowing more air to enter the engine. Continue to twist the throttle to accelerate., With the motor started, the moped should be moving without you having to pedal. Adjust your body as the force of movement pulls you back. Stay straight with your eyes on the road as you let go of the starting lever or button if you haven’t yet.	Place the key in the ignition. Pedal forward. Press the start button. Open the throttle. Release the start lever.
This will be the color you will then highlight, accent, or complement with other hues.Your “anchor” color is going to be the most prominent color in the room and will determine the overall feel or tone, so decide if you want to set a more calming environment with a neutral anchor color like off white or light gray, or if you want to create a vibrant atmosphere with a bold, bright anchor color like turquoise or orange.Of course, you can always just go with your favorite color!   Remember that even with a more neutral anchor color, you can add pops of bright, bold color to the room with accessories like throw pillows, bedding, and smaller decorative items. You may want to also choose your anchor color based on a theme, like nautical, French provincial, or California chic.To get some ideas for possible color schemes, look online at sites that showcase different designs for bedrooms., Though you may decide to add more complementary hues, its best to start with two so the room does not become overwhelmed with color.   Use your anchor color as a reference for the two hues. If you used a more neutral anchor color, you may decide to use cool hues like blue and green or warm hues like red and yellow. If you used a more bold anchor color, you may decide to use neutral hues like gray or white, or you may decide to go very bright and use hues like apricot or turquoise. Consult a color wheel to get direction on possible hues for your anchor color. When in doubt, look for examples online to give you some ideas.There are several ways to mix and match hues with tints, shades, and tones. For a good guide on this, click here: http://www.decorlove.com/how-to-choose-a-color-scheme-the-basics-of-color-coordination/.  Now that you have chosen your color scheme, figure out if you are going to be painting the walls with the anchor color or making a statement by painting only one wall.   Refer to How to Paint A Room for tips on painting a room properly.	Pick an “anchor” color. Pick two complementary hues. Decide if you are going to paint the walls of the room.
Check your kitchen cabinets to see if they go all the way to the ceiling or if there is space above them. Empty space above cabinets causes energy to get stuck there and stagnate. You need to counteract this waste of energy by filling the space with lively positive energy.Bring life with leafy, green potted plants. Don’t crowd the space, but place enough to ensure the space is well balanced. Install lighting to drive away dark energy. Place beloved objects on the cabinets that create positive energy.  It’s a common problem to have a kitchen faucet that leaks, but you may not realize how this negatively affects your house’s feng shui. Water is the symbol for wealth, so a drippy faucet literally means that your wealth is slowly draining away. If you notice that your faucet is leaking, takes steps immediately to get it fixed.Check out this article for DIY faucet fixes. At the very least, if you can’t get the leak fixed, make sure the water drips into a pitcher or basin so it can still be used rather than going down the drain. You could use this to water the plants on top of the cabinets.  Because feng shui values open space and minimalism, it is important to sort through your cabinets (and pantries) on occasion to get rid of things that you are not using. Utensils, appliances, and food that are not being used are only collecting energy and wasting it. If you know you don’t use something very often, consider whether it is really necessary or not.Getting rid of old food frequently is important because your kitchen is the source of health in your home and old food does not promote good health.  If the kitchen represents health in your home, then the stove is the center of that health because it prepares your food. Keeping your stove clean keeps the energy of the food positive, but a dirty and grimy stove reduces the energy of the food which ultimately reduces your own energy.   Use all of the stove's burners regularly to maintain the overall strength of the stove’s energy. Move your trash can away from the stove to keep the negative energy of the garbage away from the positive energy of the fresh food you prepare on the stove. When you face the stove, you may be facing away from the entrance to your kitchen. Because of this, it is possible for someone to come up behind you without you knowing it. This is bad energy because it makes you restless and you can’t focus your attention on the food. To counteract this, hang a mirror over the stove to give yourself a view behind you.	Fill negative space above cabinets. Fix the leaky faucet. Clean out cabinets regularly. Show love to your stove.
Both the time and the location of meteor showers are predictable. Look online for a meteor calendar to find out what meteor showers will be happening in your area in the near future.A meteor shower always appears from the same point in the sky, which is known as the "radiant". The meteor shower usually gets its name from the constellation that contains that radiant. Meteor showers happen year-round, with the month of November being the most active time. You can see a meteor in the night sky at any time, but if you want the best chance of seeing one (or many) plan your outing around a meteor calendar. The table above outlines the major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere region. Peak dates change slightly from year to year.; , Before you set off to view the next meteor shower that will be happening near you, check a lunar calendar to figure out what phase the moon will be in on that night. If the moon is too bright, you may not be able to see any meteors.Avoid attempting to view meteors during the moon's full or gibbous phases. The best time for viewing is when the moon is between new and first quarter, as this is when it casts the least amount of light and sets before midnight.  In addition to checking the lunar calendar, you will need to check the weather forecast for the evening that you plan to view a meteor shower. Poor weather can easily put a damper on your meteor-viewing experience.The best conditions for watching meteor showers are dry and clear. If it is very cloudy, you may not be able to see any meteors. If it is raining or snowing, you will not only have a low chance of seeing any meteors, but you will also be extremely uncomfortable sitting outside.  If the moon phase and weather conditions are both favorable for viewing a meteor shower, you will need to know exactly when to plan your meteor-viewing outing. Meteor shower typically peak between midnight and dawn, so you will have to plan on being up during the wee hours of the night.Take a long nap during the day if you plan to stay outside watching for more than an hour or so. Set an alarm if you plan to sleep. You don't want to miss out on the opportunity to view a meteor shower because you overslept.  You need an unobstructed view of the sky to properly view a meteor shower. Do your best to find a spot with no buildings or trees.Parks make excellent viewing locations as long as there aren't too many trees. Try scouting out locations a few days prior to the meteor shower. This will help ensure that you have a prime viewing location.  Light from buildings, cars, and streetlights can make it much more difficult to see meteors. Get as far away from all sources of artificial light as you can for the best viewing experience.If you live in the city, you may have to travel farther to find a suitable viewing location. The more regular stars you can see in the night sky in a given location, the better that spot will be for viewing meteors.  If you want to see a meteor shower, you will be sitting outside for a good amount of time, so it's important to keep your basic comfort in mind. Watching the meteor shower will be much more enjoyable if you are well-prepared and have everything you need.   It can get quite cold outside depending on the time of year and where you're located, so don't neglect to dress warmly. It's also a good idea to take blankets and warm drinks with you for cold-weather viewing.No matter what time of year you plan on watching the meteor shower during, consider bringing a reclining chair. This will be much more comfortable than sitting with your neck craned towards the sky.You may also want to bring some snacks and have a late-night picnic while you're star gazing.  Most meteor showers can be seen easily with the naked eye, so you really don't need to worry about having fancy equipment. You can bring binoculars and telescopes if you like, but be aware that these will limit the scope of your view. This means you may be less likely to see meteors if you use them, although you'll definitely get a closer look if you're lucky enough to spot one.It is a good idea to bring a red-tinted flashlight, as this will help you see where you are going without disrupting your natural night vision., When looking for the showers, always look toward the radiant. A constellation chart can help you identify where the radiant should be for each meteor shower. Remember that the shower is typically named after the radiant constellation.Relax your eyes instead of staring intently at the constellation. This will help you see a larger area, so you will be more likely to notice meteors in your peripheral vision.  Many astronomers enjoy recording what they see while watching a meteor shower. You can do this in one of several ways, depending on your own personal preferences.You may want to simply tally the number of meteors you see using a pen and paper. You can count shower meteors (those that originate from the radiant, or the constellation after which the meteor shower was named) and non-shower meteors (those that originate in other locations) separately. If you plan on writing this down, you will definitely need to use a red-tinted flashlight to help you see. If you don't want to have to worry about writing anything down while you're star gazing, take a recording device with you and simply dictate what you see. You can write it all down later if you wish. If you have a digital camera with a good lens, you can use it to photograph meteors, although it's a good idea to read up on astro-photography first.	Research when and where meteor showers will be occurring. Check the moon phase. Confirm that the weather will be clear. Plan to stay up late or get up early. Find a wide-open spot. Make sure your viewing location is as dark as possible. Consider your comfort. Bring the right viewing equipment. Know where to look. Consider recording what you see.
If you haven't changed your oil in over 5,000 miles (8,000 km), this is almost a necessity. If you have changed your oil in the past 5,000 miles (8,000 km), it may still be a good idea to get it changed again before having your car tested. Schedule an oil change, or do it yourself. Dirty oils can cause the emission levels to be higher than normal.  Fuel and air filters need to be changed periodically to keep your engine as efficient as possible, and your emissions as low-impact as possible. Consult your owner's manual for specific guidelines regarding mileage, and keep a steady schedule of replacements. Check your air filter and, if it is dirty, change it before your emission test, since a dirty air filter can cause high hydrocarbons.  Check your owner's manual to determine whether or not using Premium fuel is appropriate for your model. Other additives, like Clean Sky Clean Air can be added during refueling to purge carbon deposits from the engine during normal operations. Be aware that some additives could alter your emissions test and could be a cause of a failure. Be sure to tell your mechanic what additives you are using if you have failed. The additive could have been the cause.  Running too rich can have a long-term affect on your engine's ability to process hydrocarbons and CO emissions. It's a good idea to periodically check how lean or rich your engine is running to make sure you're within the proper specifications and keep your engine functioning properly.	Change your engine oil regularly. Replace your filters regularly. Use fuel additives if they're appropriate for your vehicle. Adjust your carburetor for the proper air-fuel mixture.
To create a leather cuff, you will need strips of tooled leather, leather glue, a leather needle, waxed linen thread, and a button snap or clasp for the ends of the bracelet.  Use a ruler to measure a strip of leather 2 inches (5.08 cm) wide, by the length of your wrist plus one inch. Cut the leather to size with a pair of sharp scissors or utility knife.  Attach your cut and sized leather to a larger, tooled piece of leather with leather glue. Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles, and allow it to dry overnight. Adding a second layer of leather to your bracelet will give a more finished look.  Trim the edge off the tooled leather to make it the same size as your original strip. You should now be left with a nearly completed double-sided leather strip.  Use a leather needle and waxed linen thread to stitch the cuff together. Any stitch is appropriate; the stitching is simply securing the edges of the leather and giving a more sophisticated look.  Use your needle and thread or the leather glue to secure your clasps to either end. With the completion of this step, you're finished!	Get your supplies prepared. Measure and cut your leather. Layer your leather. Cut the bracelet to size. Stitch the edges. Add your clasps.
One hand should always be firmly holding the violin and the other hand should be tuning. This position will help you to create the force needed to turn the pegs correctly and it will keep your instrument safe.  Pegs, which are often made of ebony, are knobs located on the neck of your violin near the top. Observe that each of your violin's four strings is attached to one of the four pegs. Turning one of these pegs tightens or loosens one of the strings, therefore changing its pitch. If you are tuning "E," for example, then you will be turning the bottom right peg. If you are tuning "A," you will be turning the top right peg. If you are tuning "D," you will be turning the top left peg. And, finally, if you are tuning "G," you will be turning the bottom left peg.  Keep in mind the proper tuning position.  You will be turning the peg “towards” you or “away” from you based on how you would like to change the current pitch of the string.          For strings that are very “sharp”, or high-pitched, you will need to turn the peg “towards” yourself. For strings that are very “flat” or low-pitched, you will need to turn the peg “away“ from yourself.  It is important to pluck the string so that you can hear how the pitch is changing.  This will help keep the peg in place so that the tension won’t move it and make the string slip further out of tune. This can be difficult, so have patience! You can also gently push the pegs in as you're tuning.  Is the string too high? Too low? Can it be tuned with a fine tuner, or is it so out of tune that you need to turn the peg some more?         , When it sounds just right, then you are finished. Congratulations! Time to move on to the other strings. Just as in the fine tuner method, the next string you should tune after "A" is "D", which is to the left of "A." Then, after you tune "D," you should try tuning "G." "G" is to the left of "D." Lastly, once all of the other strings are tuned, you can tune "E."	While tuning with the pegs, hold the violin in front of you so that you can see the strings and so that the bottom part of the instrument rests on your legs. Locate the correct peg that you will be using to tune. Once you have located the peg that you will be turning, you are ready to tune!, With one hand, grip the desired peg. As you turn the peg, pluck the string you are tuning but still keep a firm hold on your violin. When you would like to stop turning the peg, you should gently push the peg into the instrument to reinforce its position. When the peg finally sticks in place, pluck the string again and listen carefully. When you pluck the string and the pitch is just a little out of tune, then you may use a fine tuner to perfect the pitch.
All music has a beat or basic rhythm to it that can be counted. Music has a certain number of beats per measure, which is usually 3,4 or 6 beats. In salsa music there are 4 beats per measure. The basic salsa dance step uses 2 measures of music, or 8 beats.Try clapping the rhythm of the music while counting 1-8. Beginners should use salsa music that has a slower beat and an accented percussion. This will help you hear the beat in the music. Some good starter songs are "Slow Salsa" by Jimmy Bosch, "Cuera Maraca y Bongo" by Los Nemus, "Cosas Nativas" by Frankie Ruiz, or "Yamulemau" by Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz.; , The basic salsa step uses 8 beats to complete, however you don’t step on all 8 beats. Your feet move on beats 1,2,3 with a pause on beat 4; you step again on beats 5,6,7 and pause on beat 8.   Clap when you will be stepping, and don’t clap when you don’t step to understand the rhythm of the dance step. The rhythm will be clap-clap-clap-pause-clap-clap-clap-pause. Repeat this rhythm throughout an entire song.  Try standing and marching your feet in place using the salsa rhythm you just clapped. Step your feet down on beats 1, 2, and 3, pausing on beat 4, and repeat the sequence for beats 5 through 8.  Place numbered cards or sheet of paper on the floor to indicate where to place your feet while you dance.   Number 1 is your starting position, place it in the middle of the room. Number 2 should be placed about 1 foot in front of number 1. Number 3 should be placed about 1 foot behind number 1. Number 4 should be placed about 1 foot behind number 3.  When you are ready to begin the salsa dance you will step to the next number.  You will alternate which foot you step with for each beat., Shift your weight from front to back to shift your body position. Swing your hips slightly to accentuate the movement.  Keep your weight on the ball of your foot when you step backwards. You will stay in this position during beat 4.  Do not move your feet during beat 4.  Keep your left foot in place during step 5.  Swing your hips as you shift your body weight to help add style to your salsa dance.  Keep your weight on the ball of your foot as you step your right foot forward.  Do not pick up your feet during step 8. This is the last count of the basic salsa step.   Repeat counts 1-8 again to continue the dance.  Count the numbers of the beat and move your feet slowly to master the movement.   Add music once you are confident in the footwork.	Listen to music to hear the beat. Clap the rhythm of the steps. March the rhythm of the steps. Mark the positions of the steps on the floor. Start the dance with both feet in position 1. Step forward to number 2 with your left foot on beat 1. Rock back on your right foot on beat 2. Move your left foot back to number 3 on beat 3. Roll your weight from the ball of your foot to the heel on beat 4. Step backwards with your right foot to number 4 on beat 5. Rock your body weight forward on your left foot on beat 6. Step your right foot forward back to number 1 on beat 7. Balance your weight on beat 8. Practice the steps without music.
The color and style of the buttons is entirely up to you but you might like to consider some of the following ideas:   Choose matching but varying hues. Choose the exact same color; this could be good where you want it stand out against a plain top. Choose a rainbow of colors. Choose different patterns, or even sizes of buttons. Whatever buttons you choose, ensure that they are in excellent condition and will be able to withstand being turned into an often-worn item of jewelry. Older, more fragile buttons may not be ideal for this project.  For alternating colors, choose an even number of buttons. Arrange the buttons in a circle, alternating the colors and check that the look is suitable. You can have an odd number of buttons if the colors are matching.  For this, the button needs to be much larger than the petal buttons, as they will sit around it. You can either match this button to the petals or choose a button in a completely different color, texture or style, as long as you like how it looks.   Place the large central button over the already-made circle of petal buttons. Make sure you can see the petals poking out from around the edges.  Place this one on top of the big button. Do the same for each additional layer you want (obviously, you're limited by how large your central button is). , Using hot glue, glue the petals to the center. Then flip it back over. Use hot glue again, but this time to add the center layers. Now you have a fixed button flower.  Glue it to the back of the flower.  On the side that doesn't open, lather this with hot glue. Place it on the middle of the craft foam circle. Then place a lot of glue on either side of the pin, and on top of the side that doesn't close. Press it in for a few seconds. Then let it dry. If needed, add more glue until the pin sticks.  Enjoy your new button pin.	Choose the buttons. Decide whether you would like to alternate the petal colors or have the same color. Select the center of the button flower. Find a button somewhat smaller than the big button that is being used for the middle. Glue all the buttons together.  , Flip over the big center button. Using craft foam, cut out a circle about the size of the big center button. Open the safety pin. Finished.
The Shmoney is a really simple dance and it is great for slower songs. You can do it standing in one place, by yourself, or with a partner. You will need to start by standing with your feet shoulder width apart and bending your knees slightly.          You don’t need to get super low to the ground for this dance, but you can if you like. It is up to you.  To generate movement for the shmoney dance, you will need to start rotating and twisting your hips back and forth. Allow your knees to move along with your hips. Move to the music and just relax.         Try moving one side twice and then move the other side once to add a little variation. Or, come up with your own pattern to follow.  You can raise your arms over your head or just raise them slightly above your chest. Move your arms however you like as you do the Shmoney.         Try swaying your arms back and forth over your head or twist them back and forth in front of you.	Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Start twisting your hips. Move your arms in time with your hips.
Many formal gardens have fountains, koi ponds, small streams, and other water features to add interest to the layout. Consider installing a water feature in your garden, either as the focal point or a simple decoration.  Concrete is often used in formal garden designs in the form of urns, other plant holders, and statues. Marble is another classic stone you could use, or faux-marble if you're looking for a more affordable option.   One beautiful statue used as the centerpiece of your garden can make a huge difference. Check out garden stores and nurseries for outdoor statue options. If you decide to use urns, buy an even number and distribute them around the garden in a pattern. For example, if your garden is divided into four sections, each one should have an urn, and the urns should all contain the same kind of plant or flower.  If your formal garden is in your backyard, chances are you'll want to spend a lot of time out there. You'll need outdoor furniture that matches the theme of your garden.   Wrought iron is often a good choice for this purpose. You could also choose a different material and spray paint it either dark green or black to match the garden. Avoid plastic furniture, since a formal garden should look timeless.  Formal gardens need more maintenance than other types of gardens, especially if you have hedges that need to be trimmed to keep a certain shape. Take care of your garden throughout the summer and give it touch-ups over the winter as you prepare for spring.   Use an edger to trim the grass away from your paths. Weed your garden frequently to keep plants healthy and your garden looking neat. After watering and working in the garden, put away the hose and gardening tools. Sweep leaves and dirt off of the paths frequently.	Utilize water features. Add stone urns and statues. Add furniture. Keep your garden neat.
Erect a trellis, or other structure suitable for climbing, near the rose. The trellis must be large enough and sturdy enough to hold the climbing rose when it reaches its mature height. A smaller climbing rose will do fine with a 2- to 5-foot tall trellis.   A larger climber like the Banksian rose will require a large arbor, pergola or other sturdy structure. Once a climbing rose is established you won't be able to replace the trellis without severely damaging the plant, so try to purchase or build a trellis that will last for several decades.; , Set up the climbing structure 1 ½ feet away from the rose, if the rose is already planted. If the support structure is a fence with the first rail raised a few feet off the ground, push 2- to 3-foot tall stakes into the ground just in front of the fence.   If the rose is not yet planted, put the trellis wherever you would like your roses to grow.  For an all-around perfect rose, choose the Meiviolin, or Eden rose. These roses climb quickly, and their large traditional blooms will add elegance to any garden.   If you live in a tricky climate or you are new to growing roses, consider growing the New Dawn variety. It may be hard to find in your local area but it is resistant to nearly everything. If you have a few roses under your belt and want something different, the Madame Alfred Carrière is an excellent climber that produces large stunning blooms that remain until very late in the season. These are ideal for a large-scale project like a large arbor.  To begin, secure your trellis or fence and prepare a large hole twice the size of the rose plant.   The hole should be slightly more than a foot away from the support or trellis to allow for air circulation.  Plant the rose, paying close attention to where the roots meet the topsoil. If you live in warm climate leave about two inches of topsoil over the top of the root. If you live in colder climates, or can experience harsh winters, plant the root four to six inches below the topsoil.   These depths are important to allow the roots to grow without exposure. The topsoil also helps drain water away, reducing the chances that your rose roots will rot.  Water your rose thoroughly without wetting the leaves of the plant. Introduce fertilizer to the plant as well as bone meal to encourage healthy growth. Roses like well-drained, rich soil so apply organic material such as compost or peat to the area.   Remember to keep the stem clear from too much material to deter disease.	Build a trellis with the rose’s size in mind. Set up the climbing structure. Choose the climbing rose you would like to grow. Prepare a hole for your rose. Plant your rose. Water your rose.

You can buy comic-printed fabric from the fabric store.You can also buy a comic-printed shirt or skirt, and use that instead; make sure that the fabric is cotton and non-stretch.; , Fabric shoes would work best for this, because the glue will stick better. If your shoes are made out of patent leather, or a similar material, lightly buff them with fine-grit sandpaper or an emery board; this will give the glue something to grab on to.   If there are any embellishments on your shoes, be sure to cut them off; you can always glue them back on later.  The easiest way to do this would be to lay the fabric on top of the shoe, and then to cut around it.This method is just for one shoe. You'll need to repeat it for your other shoe. It is easiest to work on one shoe at a time.  Keep the fabric on top of the shoe and position your scissors just above the heel seam. Cut straight down the fabric until you are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the top of the opening (closest to the toe)., You can also use a decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge, but make sure that it is waterproof.  Make sure that the fabric is stretched over the surface of the shoe, and that there aren't any puckers or wrinkles.  Try your best to follow the curves of the heels. Don't worry about the top opening just yet. When you get close to the heel of the shoe, stop.   You can leave the heels covered or uncovered. If you plan on covering them, skip over them for now; you will need to use a separate piece of fabric for that.  Pat some glue onto the heel of your shoe first, then press the fabric down onto the glue, making sure to pull it nice and taut., You are including this extra fabric so that you can fold it under itself and create a finished seam. Don't glue it down just yet, however., For a more secure finish, coat the underside of the fabric with glue first, then fold the raw edge under itself by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Brush on some glue under the fabric, then press it down onto the shoe., Go back to where you cut the slit, and cut the opening out until it is ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the edge of the shoe. Next, cut slits into the fabric. Make the slits further apart along the straight edges of the shoe, and closer together in the curved areas (such as the toe). This will help the fabric lay smoother inside your shoe, and prevent wrinkling and buckling, which might make your shoes uncomfortable to wear.If your heels are peep-toes, use a similar technique: trim the fabric down to ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then cut slits into it.  Many crafters find that the inside of shoes doesn't take glue well for some reason. To ensure that the fabric stays down, brush glue onto the shoe and the fabric, then press the fabric down. If the fabric still won't stay down, secure it with metal clips until the glue dries.   If your shoes are peep-toes, use a similar technique: glue the fabric down, then secure it with clips until it dries.  The easiest way to do this would be to run a craft blade down the seam between your shoe and the sole.This may even tuck the fabric into the seam.   If you have a lot of excess fabric, you can trim it away with a pair of scissors first.  Run some fabric glue along the seam where the body of your shoe joins the sole. Next, run something blunt along the seam to tuck the raw edges in. You can use your fingernail, a butter knife, a skewer, or even a knitting needle to do this., Start by measuring the height and circumference of your heel. Next, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the height, and 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters) to the length. Cut the fabric out, then do the following:   Fold the bottom and one of the side edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Cover the heel with glue. Wrap the fabric around it, starting with the raw edge and finishing with the folded edge. Keep the seam on the inside of the heel. Run a craft blade along the top seam of your heel to cut away any excess fabric. This should also tuck the raw top edges into the seam.  If your fabric has any glue "stains" on it, then coating it with Mod Podge or sealer would help hide them. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that it is waterproof.   It might be an even better idea to add 2 to 3 coats of Mod Podge or sealer. Make sure that you let each coat dry before applying the next.  Even though the glues and sealers you used are waterproof, it would be best to avoid getting these shoes wet. If you get them wet, the fabric may start to bubble and warp.	Get some comic-printed fabric. Choose a pair of plain high heels. Cut a piece of fabric big enough to cover one shoe. Cut a slit down the middle of the fabric for the opening. Use a foam brush to coat the toe area with a thick layer of fabric glue. Smooth the fabric down onto the glue. Cover the sides of the shoe with more glue, and smooth the fabric down into the glue. Trim one side of the fabric down until it goes ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the back seam, and glue it down. Trim the other side of the fabric until it goes 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) past the seam. Fold the raw edge under itself, then glue the fabric down. Shape the top opening. Glue the fabric inside your shoe. Trim the excess fabric away along the sole. Seal the fabric along the sole for extra security. Consider covering the heel area as well. Seal the fabric with Mod Podge, or another type of sealer, if desired.This may not be necessary if you used fabric glue, but it would be a good idea if you used Mod Podge. Let your shoes dry completely before you wear them.
, Then add about two inches (5cm) to that, to allow space for tying. Mark the measurement you've made and cut a piece of string (it can also be wire, stretchy sting, yarn, or just regular thin string) the length of the measurement.  Although you can thread beads randomly, it is more effective if you plan the bead layout before threading. This can be done by drawing a design on paper or by laying out the actual beads to be used on a jewelry board or on white paper or a clean surface. Using the beads is a good approach because it lets you visualize the end result easily and you can make instant changes to perfect the layout as you go. There are endless design possibilities, so don't be afraid to try out many ways. If you have a few designs you like, you can always make more rings and give them away to friends.   Be careful not to drop the string while you're adding beads, or else all the beads will fall off. It's a good idea to work over a tray in case this happens, so that the beads are easy to retrieve.You may want to tape one end of the string down on a flat surface to easily thread the beads. Don't put beads along the entirety string or you'll have to remove them to be able to tie the ring together.  Make sure that the ring fits before double knotting it.   Be sure to double or even triple knot your ties. If you don't, the ring risks falling apart.  This method can also be applied to other jewelry such as necklaces and bracelets. Just adjust the measurements as needed.	Gather the materials listed here:   Scissors       A flexible ruler or a tape measure       String       Small beads      ; , Using the ruler, measure around your finger. Thread the beads onto the string. When you're done threading, tie the string at the position indicated by the measurement you took earlier. Finish up and the ring is ready to wear. Finished.
Using scissors, cut the ribbon to your desired length.   Use caution when cutting with scissors.; , Fold the left tail over the right tail. Make sure your ribbon isn't twisted or bunched., Fold the left tail completely behind and underneath the right tail.  Bring the left tail up through the hole and pull the tails. You should have a smooth even knot., At this point, your ribbon simply looks like tails and a knot in the center. Trim the tails close to the knot.Cut a chevron at each end or tail. The top of the chevron should be pointing towards the knot.	Cut your ribbon. Cross the tails. Knot the tails. Pull the knot. Trim the tails.
While cleaning vinyls can make them sound better, over-cleaning them can actually be bad. The constant rubbing and wiping you do to clean them can eventually cause scratching and warped grooves, which can even make a vinyl unplayable.  The best way to tell if your vinyl should be cleaned is by taking one finger and swiping it gently around the record one time. If you see any dust or debris on your finger tip then that means you probably have to clean it.; , You will need glass cleaner, a couple microfiber rags, wood glue, and, of course, a dirty vinyl. One important thing to make note of when buying wood glue is to find a bottle with a good pouring tip and that it is free of urea-formaldehyde. This type of glue works best because it dries faster at room temperature than other types of glue, and it is much easier to remove.  One or two sprays should be enough, putting too much on can flood the grooves on the record will cause it to dry much slower.  Be sure to only go in one direction when wiping; it while cover the whole surface of the record, front and back.  Do this on each side for about fifteen seconds. Then let the record sit on a soft surface to dry completely for ten minutes before the next step of the cleaning process. , Use a spoon or popsicle stick and mix the glue vigorously for about two minutes; this will help thin it out before applying it. However, if it still feels too thick you can apply a tablespoon of water and mix it to thin it out a little more. Once it has the viscosity of honey, it should be perfect to start using.  Take the record and place it on a sheet of wax paper; this will prevent scratching during cleaning. Take your bottle of wood glue and shake it before finally squeezing it out. Then put the tip of the bottle and place it on the outermost groove of the vinyl. Slowly squeeze the bottle to apply a consistent stream of glue as you go along the groove from the outside all the way to the very middle.  Let the record sit for four hours to ensure that the glue has dried completely.  Test to see if it completely dry by tapping on it with a couple fingers. If it feels soft at all it is best to let it sit for at least another hour.    Attempting to remove it before it dries can permanently damage the record. When it is finally dry you can move on to the final part of the cleaning process.  Then go around over and over, carefully lifting the dry glue from the vinyl.  You want to make sure that you remove it all in one piece, if  you see it ripping just  slow down and be more careful. Once you have completely removed the glue, wipe it down one more time and repeat the last two steps on the other side of the vinyl.	Avoid over-cleaning. Get the right supplies. Take one of you microfiber rags and spray some glass cleaner on it. Rub the rag all around the record in a circular motion. Take the second, unused, rag and dry the record by wiping it gently in the same direction as before. Take a dry rag and quickly wipe it down one more time to ensure there is nothing left between the grooves.  , Open your bottle of wood glue and screw the cap off. Start applying the glue to the record. Once you have gone all the way around, use a rag to even out the glue all over the surface. Check the state of the glue after four hours. Gently move your thumb along the outer rim of the record to lift the glue.
Ask friends and family for recommendations, then take your car to the shop for something simple such as an oil change.; , If you have a feeling or intuition that the mechanic is less than trustworthy, take your vehicle elsewhere. Take your car to a second mechanic for another opinion if the estimate sounds high, or if something just doesn't seems right. If your car isn't running, call a tow truck. You aren't obligated to stay with a mechanic just because he looked at your car and gave you an estimate.  Ask if there have been any complaints about the mechanic, and if so, how the problems were resolved.  The symbol should be not only on the sign, but on a certificate on the wall and usually on the mechanic's uniform. Shops approved by AAA (American Automobile Association) are also a good bet. AAA approval means that the work must be guaranteed for 6,000 miles (9,700 km) or six months.  Read your vehicle's manual and stay current with recommendations for oil changes and other maintenance schedules. Being familiar with your vehicle will help you prevent auto repair rip-offs.  For example, if you have a foreign car, be sure the mechanic has the experience and equipment to deal with your vehicle.  If you aren't sure, outline the problems very clearly and find out exactly how the mechanic plans to deal with each problem. Be specific and never give a mechanic free reign to do whatever your car needs without discussing it with you first.  Read estimate carefully and ask questions if something seems odd or isn't clear. Ask if the parts and work are guaranteed.  Check the bill carefully and ask for clarification on any discrepancies. Pay by credit card or check so that you have a record of payment and so you can stop payment if you think you've been ripped off.	Find a trustworthy mechanic before you actually need one so that you won't be pressed into locating one in a hurry if your car suddenly breaks down. Trust your instinct. Prevent rip-offs by contacting the Better Business Bureau, AAA (American Automobile Association) and the Consumer Affairs Office in your city or state. Look for shops with an ASE symbol on the sign, which indicates the shop met the criteria for Automotive Service Excellence. Be familiar with your vehicle. Ask if the shop has experience dealing with your type of car. Make a checklist of what work your vehicle needs. Get an itemized written estimate in advance and be sure the mechanic contacts you before doing any work that exceeds the original estimate. Request a detailed invoice that includes costs of labor and parts.
The box can be plain, or it can be decorated. Craft stores sell many beautiful cardboard boxes that would be perfect for storing bracelets.  You can make the box all one color, or use different colors for the inside and the outside. If you want to add designs to your box, paint the background color first, let it dry, then add the designs.   If your bracelets are delicate, consider covering the inside of your box with velvet.  You will need these measurements to make your dividers.  This will give you several long compartments for you to store your bracelets in. If you want a half-sided compartment, then cut several shorter pieces of cardboard to use as a divider between two compartments.  You can match the color to the inside of the box, or use a contrasting color. Paint one side and let it dry first. Flip the pieces over, then paint the other side.   If you covered the inside of your box with velvet, then you might want to use velvet for this as well.  Coat the bottom and side edges of a divider with liquid glue, and slide it into the box. It should fit snuggly. If it flops over, consider bracing it with a heavy object, such as a jar. If you need to reinforce the dividers, wait until the glue dries, then draw a line of glue between the seams.   If you are using shorter dividers: glue in all of the long/horizontal dividers first, then add in the short/vertical dividers.  To add a tube, follow the directions below.   Cut the paper towel tube down until it is at least an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wider than your box. Paint the tube, or cover it with velvet fabric. Cut deep grooves into each side of the box, wide and deep enough for the paper towel to sit in. Slip your bracelets onto the tube. Set the tube down into the grooves.	Find a cardboard box large enough to hold your bracelet collection. Paint the box using spray paint or acrylic paint. Measure the height and width of box. Cut a few pieces of cardboard according to those measurements. Paint the cardboard pieces using spray paint or acrylic paint. Glue the dividers into the box. Consider adding a paper towel tube for the bracelets that need to be draped.You can take the tube out to remove the bracelets whenever you want. Finished.
Count out 12 links, and measure them from the first pin to last pin. The distance between those pins should be 12 inches (30.48 centimeters). If the distance is more than 12 1/8 inches (30.80 centimeters), then you need to replace the chain. This is because pins are wearing out, lengthening the chain.If the distance between the 12 links is correct, and you have an older bike, consider loosening the back wheel and pulling it back. This may take up enough of the chain's slack to fix the problem.; , This tool pushes the pins out of your chain to allow link removal. If you know the make and model of your bike chain, you may prefer to track down a specialized tool for that specific chain.   Some chains, notably most Shimano and Campagnolo models, also require a special reassembly pin.You cannot put the chain back together without this pin, so make sure you have the right part before you get started.  If you do not have a bike stand, lean it against something sturdy, preferably upside down. This will make it easier to remove the chain.  Use a high-quality, biodegradable chain cleaner to dissolve any dirt or grease. This will make it easier to handle the chain and find the master link., Your chain may or may not have a master link. The master link is easy to spot, because it is usually slightly lighter/darker than the other links on the chain. It may also have protruding pins inserted into a special outer plate. This plate typically has an oversize, oval hole around one or both pins.  This will make it easier to access. The master link is easy to spot, because it is usually slightly lighter/darker than the other links on the chain. It may also have protruding pins inserted into a special outer plate. This plate typically has an oversize, oval hole around one or both #*If your chain does not have a master link, you'll use a chain tool to break the chain. The steps to do so are described in Part 2: Shortening the Chain.  There are many designs of master links. Some swivel to allow the pin to slide out, while others open up when flexed. Some master links are also disposable, and can only be removed by bending them apart with needle-nose pliers or a specialized tool.  It's better to take off too few links at first than to take off too many. It'll be easier to take off an extra link or two than to add several links back on., Start at the end of the chain not attached to the master link. Hold that link in place with a vise, or use the clamping mechanism on your chain tool if present.   If your chain does not use a master link, start with any link on the chain.  Line up the punch on the tool over the link's pin. Slowly turn the handle on the chain tool clockwise, and stop when the pin is clear of the outer plate, but still attached to the link. Do not push the pin completely out of the link, or it will be very difficult to reassemble the chain. If you did accidentally push the pin all the way out:Slide the pin through the center of the link. Use the chain tool to remove the upper part of the joining link. Use the chain tool to slide the pin back through the link, until the top of the pin is flush with the center part of the link. Replace the top part of the link, then use the chain tool push the pin back up. Adjust the adjacent pin, as necessary.  Move on to the other pin in the same link. Push this out far enough that you can lift away one of the outer plates, followed by the central piece attaching it to the next link.  Only remove the minimum number of links to make your chain work, generally less than five. The more you shorten the chain, the more stress you'll put on the links.   As before, leave the pins partially attached and set aside all components. Consider saving the chain links you are removing for future repairs., You may need to use some pliers or a screwdriver in order to do this. Push the two links together until you feel the pins click into place in the inner link.   If your chain has a disposable master link or special pin, you'll need a replacement part to reattach the chain. Most of these special pins come in two parts that enter from opposite sides, but it's best to look for model-specific instructions.  Place the two links back into the chain tool's outer slot. Make sure that the pins are facing towards the chain tool's pin. Turn the handle counterclockwise. As you turn, the chain tool's pin will start pushing the pins back through the link. Keep going until you can see a small portion of the link from the other side. The chain pin should be sticking out the same amount on both sides of the link.If you have quick-release link, you may need a pair of pliers in order to replace it., Sometimes, the chain links end up too stiff after you re-connect them. Start by placing the link into the inner slot of the chain tool. Tighten the chain tool's pin until it touches the chain's pin. Give the tool's handle a quarter of a turn, remove the chain, and test it. If it is too tight, repeat the process., It will also improve shifting performance, and reduce wear on derailleur assemblies and drivetrain cogs.	Determine whether the chain needs replacing. Purchase a universal chain tool if you don't have one. Mount the bike on a bike stand. Clean the chain if it is dirty. Locate the master link. Rotate the pedals until the master link is between the front and back gears. Open the master link, slide it off, and put it someplace where it won't get lost. Decide how many links you need to remove. Clamp the next link of the chain. Push the pin most of the way out. Repeat for the second pin and disassemble the link. Remove additional links to shorten the chain. Place the master link onto both ends of the chain. Reconnect the chains using the chain tool. Loosen the chain, if necessary. Apply a high-quality lubricant to the chain.This will increase the chain's lifespan and flexibility.
Air intakes are devices on all vehicles that allow the engine to mix air with fuel, thus making combustion possible. While the air intake will always be attached to the engine housed beneath the hood, different manufacturers produce their vehicles to different specifications, and so air intakes are located in different locations on different vehicles. Consult your vehicle’s user guide to identify the location of your air intake.Air intakes often look like metal tubes. They might be powder-coated or painted in the same color as the vehicle.  Keep the can of starting fluid upright. Aim the can’s nozzle at the air intake from about 12 inches (20 centimeters) away. Spray the starting fluid for about two seconds, then try to turn the engine over. If the engine still doesn’t turn over, spray another two-second blast.You many need to remove the filter covering your air intake to do this., If the engine won’t start even with an appropriate application of starting fluid, the engine itself might not be the problem. For instance, your car’s ignition switch might be faulty, or some other system could be to blame. Talk to a reputable mechanic in your area and get their opinion on how to handle the problem.	Locate your air intake. Spray a small amount of starting fluid into the air intake. Take your vehicle to a mechanic if it doesn’t start.
Don't stuff things under the bed. Put things in old shoe boxes then carefully put them under in an organized manner.

This is a plastic tube you slide onto a needle that counts rows for you. You can purchase a little knitting counter from any good knitting or craft supplies store. Use this counter to help you keep track of the stripes rather than trying to keep the numbers in your head and forgetting them instantly when distracted! This saves a lot of time when you count down or mark the rows.; , If you do this, it will cut down on the number of ends that need to be sewn (darned) in later.  This way they will stay neat and the look remains seamless.  They do the work for you and create the stripes as you knit! Make sure you know the effect before starting your project; ask your knitting supplier salesperson to help you with this.	Use a counter. Carry the unused yarns up the side of the fabric as you knit stripes and work them in. Always change colours at the end of the row. Try self-striping yarns.
Before visiting a local state office where you can register your vehicle, check your state’s DMV website to make sure you bring all of the necessary paperwork. While the specific process varies, the basic order of operation is similar in most states.The federal DMV website also has information about registration requirements in each U.S. state. Current registration is required in every U.S. state. While some states require you to update your registration annually, registration lasts longer in some states.  If you want to make sure you have everything ready before visiting the DMV, download all of the forms you’ll need directly from the DMV website. Print them and fill them out at home to make sure you have all of the necessary information.You can also find information about applicable fees and taxes. Be ready to pay these when you register your car.  The names of these offices may differ. For instance, your state may have brick-and-mortar DMV offices, while other states provide these administrative services at Secretary of State offices. Department of Revenue and Motor Vehicle Division offices also exist in some states.Bring along your title, proof of insurance, and emission test results or smog check paperwork if these are required in your state. Note that many states use your vehicles VIN as the vehicle registration number.	Check a DMV website for registration requirements. Download and fill out forms ahead of time. Visit a local state office to complete registration.
If using more than one color, choose your pattern carefully.  Make sure the strips come out even.  Start with your first color if you are using more than one color.  Keep on painting for a larger doorframe, and stop earlier for a shorter doorframe.  If the size seems too short or too long, either remove a strip or paint another one and attach it. If removing a strip, be very careful and gentle as you do so. Not doing this may result in some of the paper being pulled off with the tape.  Repeat this process until the doorframe is covered entirely, or leave a small open space if desired.	Choose the paint colors you are going to use. Cut the blank pieces of paper into inch-thick strips, or whatever size is appropriate. Begin painting the strips. Stop painting once you have gotten four strips, if that is the desired length. Tape the painted strips together. Tape the large strip to the top of the doorframe. You are now finished and your curtain is ready to be used!
Some rental car companies will provide you with a discount if you pay for the entire rental up-front, rather than when you pick-up or return the car. This can be especially helpful when the car you’re renting has unlimited mileage, so you know the price you’re paying up-front will not change later., Most car rental agencies have loyalty programs that give points to frequent renters. Signing up for such programs is usually free, and may even provide other advantages (e.g. easier checkin, etc.).Most of these loyalty programs work for any rental you book worldwide, as long as it’s with the same agency. If you rent cars frequently, but don’t always use the same agency, sign-up for more than one loyalty program so you always receive points. Be careful as points can expire, or memberships can become inactive, if you don’t meet certain criteria.  Car rental agencies will charge a lower price per day the longer you rent a car. For example, booking a car for 1 week will be cheaper than if you book it for 6 days. If you’re able to book a car for a longer period of time, you’ll pay less per day.	Agree to pay for your rental early. Join a rental car company’s frequent renter program. Increase your rental time.
From zombies to princesses, Halloween costumes fit right in for the Time Warp. The flashier and zanier the better, whether that's piles of pink ruffles and glitter, or skeleton face paint.  One of the dancing characters from the Rocky Horror film version, Columbia, has the flashiest costume of all. Cover yourself in gold or rainbow sequins and glittery makeup to imitate her. Bonus points if you wear a glittery top hat and fishnet stockings, or cover your eyebrows with makeup., The characters Janet and Brad are the quiet, "normal" people caught in a group of strange people, which means their costumes are usually easier to imitate. Dress as Janet by wearing a light pink dress and a white sweater, plus a sun hat. Dress as Brad with "hipster" clothing, for instance a tucked-in button-up shirt, khaki pants, and combed-back hair., At many performances of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, where the Time Warp dance comes from, people might make fun of you for wearing stripes. This supposedly references a scene in the movie when someone wearing a striped shirt was caught on camera accidentally, but it's a tradition of it's own at this point.	Wear a Halloween costume. Dress in glitter and sequins. Dress with one of the simpler costumes from the show. Avoid stripes if you're going to a Rocky Horror show.
The block should be smaller then the paper you are using by an inch on all sides. Save scarp piece to practice carving on.; , If there are any small imperfections use the sandpaper to smooth them out. , Rub the back of the paper with the design on it with chalk. Then lay the paper chalk side down on the block. Then trace the design. Your design will be reversed on the final print so if you do any writing you need to trace and carve the letter backwards so the appear correctly in the print.	Cut wood to desired size using the saw. Look at both sides of the wood and pick the side that is smoother or has the nicer grain to be carved. Paint the India ink on the side you are going to carve and then let the block dry.  , Transfer your design.
Be sure to wash off all debris no matter how small, especially oil grease.; ,,   Fiberglass can release glass dust into the air when sanded, which is dangerous to inhale and can irritate skin. To prevent this, wet the areas of the chair you're about to sand with water as you go. The water will trap the dust and keep it out of the air . , Let it dry.   If you're using the recommended paint sprayer, fill the sprayer's tank with your primer mixture and spray on the chair from there. If you're stuck using a paint brush, just dip and prime. , Now you're ready to paint!  , Let the paint dry, then repeat the process.   Apply 2 to 3 coats. If you're using the paint sprayer wash the primer out of it first.  Use the sprayer if you have it or the brush if your don't.   Penetrol is an effective and widely available top coat option in the US . Be especially careful if using a brush for this step. Brush marks made here will be painfully visible. !	Clean the surface of the chair with water and detergent. Fill up the dents and the holes in the fiberglass with body filler using the paint spreader.  , Sand down the surface, preferably with an orbital sander . Dilute the acrylic primer with a small amount of acrylic thinner.  , Apply the primer all over the chair. Sand down the primer until smooth.  , Repeat steps 5 & 6 to add a second layer of primer. Apply your chosen paint to the chair using the sprayer or the brush. The final step is to seal the paint with a clear top coat. Enjoy your beautifully restored vintage chair!
Make sure that they are clean. If they are dirty, wash them using soap and warm water. Pat them dry with a paper towel.; , The best surface to work on would be a slab of wood or an old cutting board you won't mind poking holes in. The underside of the bottle cap should be facing up. You will be punching the hole from the inside.  Place a small, thin nail against the top of the bottle cap. Hit the top of the nail with a hammer. Try to get the hole as close to the side edge as possible.   Make sure that you are punching the hole near the top of the bottle cap design.  Take hold the jump ring with a pair of jewelry pliers, making sure that the seam is facing upwards. Pinch the other side of the jump ring with your fingers or another pair of pliers. Twist the jump ring towards you. Do not pull the jump ring apart, or it won't close evenly again.  Don't close the ring just yet.  Use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Even though you are working on one earring at a time, it might be a good idea to cut the chain for your other earring at this time as well. This way, you can be sure that they are perfectly even.   To make basic earrings without a chain, omit this step. Click here to continue.  Grab the jump ring again with your jewelry pliers. Make sure that the seam is facing upwards again. Pinch the other part of the jump ring with your fingers or another pair of pliers. The bottle cap and chain should be hanging from the jump ring. Carefully pull the two ends towards each other to flatten and close them.  Pull open a new jump ring as before, and slip it onto the top of the chain. Don't close the jump ring just yet.  Use the same twisting motion as you did on the first jump ring.  When you are done, you can wear the earrings, sell them, or give them away as a gift.	Find two matching bottle caps. Place the bottle cap down on a sturdy surface. Punch a hole into the bottle cap. Twist open a jump ring. Slip the jump ring through the hole you made earlier. Cut a 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) long piece of delicate chain. Slip one end of the chain onto the jump ring, and twist the ring close. Attach another jump ring to the top of each chain. Slip an earring hook onto the jump ring and twist it close. Repeat the whole process of the other earring.
The epic series began in 1977, with the release of A New Hope. The film's soul purpose is to enlighten the audience on the context and convoluted politics surrounding the Star Wars world. The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi soon followed respectively. The combination of these films assembled is now known as the first trilogy.   A comfortable 17 years later, Lucas released The Phantom Menace (Episode I). Episode I was soon followed by Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith respectively. The combination of these films assembled is now known as the second trilogy.; , This is the order that the films were originally released in. Be aware: the second trilogy was set before the first trilogy. This can be confusing, so if selecting this method, proceed with caution. Original Release:   A New Hope (Episode IV) The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V) Return of the Jedi (Episode VI) The Phantom Menace (Episode I) Attack of the Clones (Episode II) Revenge of the Sith (Episode III)	Understand the order of release. Watch the films in that order.
If you receive tropical flowers as a gift or buy them from a florist, you should immediately unpack them and put them in water. Don’t delay doing this or you will significantly reduce their lifespan.; , Before you place the tropical flowers in water, cut the bottom third of an inch off the stems using a clean sharp knife. The freshly cut stems will absorb water more easily.Cut the stems at a 45 degree angle, as this maximizes the amount of plant cell in contact with water. Remove any foliage that will sit below the waterline, as this will rot underwater and reduce the life of the flowers.  It’s advisable to add cut flower food to the vase water if you have some. Sometimes the flower food will be supplied with the flowers.  50–55 °F (10–13 °C) is the ideal temperature for tropical flowers, but unfortunately this temperature can be difficult to achieve, as it will be cooler than the room temperature of your house but warmer than the refrigerator.   The best compromise is probably to move the flowers to a cool, north-facing window ledge during the day, then putting them into the coldest room in the house overnight – a cold garage or cellar might work.  Some florists will spray tropical flowers with a special anti-transpirant to prevent water loss, however that’s probably a step too far for the normal householder.	Put tropical flowers in water immediately upon taking them home. Cut the stems and remove foliage. Fill a vase two-thirds full of cold water. Keep the flowers at a temperature as close to 50–55 °F (10–13 °C) as possible. Change the water in the vase every 2 or 3 days.
Your character can be from an American, Japanese, Chinese, or any other media. You could even cosplay as a member of the opposite gender or animal. It's really all up to you.;	This can be from a show, movie, game, comic, anime, manga, or even band.
There are various options available here:   Choose a different layer for each part of the box: An outside paper layer, an inside paper layer and a lid layer. Choose the same layer for the whole box. Or dual layers of all the same inside the lid and box, and a different all the same outside of the lid and box. Choose a layer of paper for inside the box and decoupage pieces for outside the box. Paint or fabric line the inside of the box and only decoupage the outside of the box.	Decide how the box will look.
If you want to turn right, push the handlebars on the right side. If you want to turn left, push the handlebars on the left side. While this may seem incorrect, turning the bars in the opposite direction from the turn forces the bike to tilt slightly, while maintaining the proper speed allows it to stay upright. Memorize this countersteering mantra: Turn right, push right. Turn left, push left.  As you approach your turn, signal at least 100 feet (37 meters) before the turn, and check your mirrors for signs of traffic. Move to the outside third of your lane–the corner opposite the direction of your turn. Don’t go so far that you’re putting yourself in danger of oncoming traffic. Just chose the outer third so that you can enter the turn with enough room to swing back to the inside.  Turning on a motorcycle is dependent on the speed you are traveling, so it's important to brake on your approach to the turn, then hold steady on the throttle during the turn. Downshift before the turn if necessary, but never in it. You can shift into a higher gear during the turn if you want to, but don't do this until you get more comfortable.   The balance of the motorcycle is gyroscopic, which means that speed keeps it up. Depending on the grade of the turn you're making and the speed at which you're traveling, you'll probably need to slow down some. Never, under any circumstances, should you slow in the middle of a turn, or brake in the middle of a turn, unless there's some emergency. Even then, it's safer to evade than to attempt to stop. If you absolutely must stop then level your handlebars out before you start to brake. Square your handlebars and then apply progressive pressure to both brakes at the same time. 70 % of your stopping power comes from your front brake, but don’t grab it – especially in a turn. Apply progressive pressure.	Push the handlebars on the direction you want to turn. Use the delayed apex strategy. Slow your bike before turns.
Before you go buying all of this elaborate dance gear you might want to check if your dance school has a dress code. If the dress code is a black leotard and pink tights feel free to expand on that. Get a really prettied designed black leotard and match it with seamless or convertible tights. Make sure that you are comfortable and can dance. There are also many types of shoes such as ballet flats, pointe shoes, tap shoes, jazz shoes, foot undies and much more. Make sure to get the correct kind of shoes and check with your dance teacher before you start sewing on ribbons and elastics.   If you have to wear a black leotard and pink tights, get a fancy leotard and some convertible tights. Try using some warm-up gear. Don't worry, you don't have to have a team jacket and all that. Just wearing some casual leggings/trash bag pants and a neutral dance warm-up jacket is fine.; , Put it in a bun, ponytail, braid, or whatever will get your hair out of your face and so that you don't need to keep fixing it. Most studios prefer if students have their hair in a bun.  The most important thing is that your hair doesn't fall out. If you are doing turns, leaps and frantic dance steps, you don't want to have to go to the side and redo your hair.   Start by pulling your hair back into a simple ponytail. If you have bangs, secure them back with a headband or with clips. If you don't have a lot of hair, it might be a good idea to get a bun doughnut or a bun wig. If you have enough hair wrap your hair in a circular formation and secure with bobby pins. After this wrap, a hair net around the bun and you're good to go. Start adding colorful flowers, hair bands, and clips.  Select a dance bag that has ample room, with lots of pockets. Put in all of your different types of dance shoes in the bag with a smaller bag for all of the things that you need for your pointe shoes. Add a water spray bottle, deodorant, hairspray, stretch gear (sweatpants and dance gear), makeup, rubber bands, bobby pins, extra tights and anything extra your teacher might want you to bring.   Try not to wear any makeup to dance class, as it can easily run down due to sweat and it will be messy.  Eating too much before dance can cause you to feel nauseous or tired., You want to arrive at dance class at least 15 minutes early. This gives you time to stretch, talk to your friends and be ready for class in time.  This makes sure that you are ready and secures that you won't get hurt. It may be a good idea to even take an extra stretch class. You can also buy things like stretch bands. This makes your ankles stronger and feels like you're pushing against a force.   Try stretching forward on the ground with legs straight in front of you and toes pointed, and then repeat with toes flexed. Stretch in the butterfly, and then open up to a straddle. Lean to the left and then right. Repeat the straddle stretches. Then, still in a straddle, stretch forward with the feet flexed all the way. Now roll through the middle splits onto your belly and push up, stretching out your back. Do this with no hands. Then do it with your legs behind you bent. Some people call this a cereal pose. Then roll back through the middle splits and do all of your splits, including the center.	Put on your leotard and tights. Consider wearing it off your face and shoulders. Arrange the hair to sit in the fixed style securely. Pack your bag with everything you need. Eat a small, healthy light snack before dance class. Go to class early. Stretch before class.
Jicama doesn’t do well during a frost, so wait to plant until the weather has warmed up to plant it in your garden. Research the average date of the last frost in your area, and plant your jicama one to two weeks after this date.The jicama plant may not grow properly if you live in an environment that stays mostly cold.; , Unless you already have seeds, you will need to obtain them. Jicama seeds can be purchased at a nursery, some home improvement stores, or even online. Check the packet to make sure you have the right seeds before planting., Put the jicama seeds in lukewarm water to speed up germination. Place seeds in a shallow pan of warm water. Allow them to sit for 24 hours. Then, remove the seeds from the water., Look for a place in your garden that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. The spot you choose to grow the jicama will have an effect on the outcome of the harvest. The location you choose should be exposed to full sun for the duration of the six to eight hours., Choose a location with moist but well-drained soil. Make sure the soil is alkaline with a pH over 7. You can test this easily with a commercial pH tester.If you want to grow the seeds before the last frost, then you can plant them in a pot indoors. You should use planting soil, perlite, or vermiculite, and a little peat moss in a medium-sized pot. The pot should be placed under a grow light or by a sunny windowsill. If you start with the seeds in a pot, wait for them to grow to 3 in (7.6 cm) tall before you plant them in the garden.  If you decide to plant the seeds in a pot before the frost, you will need to take care of the seeds. Once you have planted them in a medium-sized pot with planting soil, water the seeds regularly until the last frost. Water the seeds until the soil is moist any time the soil feels dry.  Make the holes about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) in depth. The amount of holes you dig depends on the amount of seeds you have to plant. The holes should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. If you plant more than one row, then the rows should be 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) apart., You can dig the holes first, or dig them as you plant the seeds. The soil should feel moist and warm without you watering it first. Cover the seeds and tamp them down lightly. , Sprinkle water over the soil after you plant and then when it becomes dry. Do not saturate the seeds with water, even if the soil is dry. The soil should only feel moist once you sprinkle the water.Using a watering can will help regulate how much water you pour onto the soil.  You can use an all-purpose fertilizer. The exact instructions for fertilizing depends on the directions on the package of your fertilizer. Typically, you just need to apply the fertilizer around the base of the plant. You can purchase fertilizer at a nursery or at many home improvement stores.Ask an employee at your nursery for fertilizer recommendations if you aren’t sure about which brand to buy.  Jicama vines grow quite tall, so they will need support as they grow. Stake the vines when they are about 24 inches (61 cm) in length. Place wooden tomato stakes about 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep into the soil next to the jicama vine. Loosely tie each plant with twine., Don’t forget to keep the soil moist as the jicama grows. Test the soil out by feeling it with your hand or gently digging into it with your fingers. Only water when the soil is dry since jicama does not do well with over-watering., Remove the tiny flowers that bloom on the jicama. Removing the flowers encourages stronger root growth. You can remove them with your hand, scissors, or pruners., Jicama is not likely to have pest problems during growth. This is because the flowers, seeds, and leaves are poisonous. If you do find that you have a pest problem, remove the pests yourself, or use an organic pest spray.Make sure you know what type of pests you are targeting when you go to buy pest spray.  Unearth the tubers from the ground using a trowel. Wait until late fall, but before the first frost to dig your tubers. This will be approximately 150 days from the time of planting. Unearth the tubers earlier than that if the vine shows signs of dying. Be careful to avoid injuring the tubers during removal. Take your time.The tubers should be 3-6 inches (7.6-15.2 cm) in diameter.  The tubers should be firm and round. Tubers that are soft and shriveled with visible cracks and/or bruising should probably be thrown out. Brush the soil off of the tubers.Gently soak or wash them into water to remove clumps of mud or soil. Allow them to dry.<  , Jicama plants will deteriorate if they are stored in a location below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Ideally, store them in a location that is 53 to 60 degrees (11 to 15 degrees Celsius). This may be in a garage or heated basement. The location you choose should be dry. It should not be wet or humid. The jicama should be fresh and ready to eat for up to two months if stored properly.You can store the jicama in bowls, racks, or pans.	Plant jicama after the danger of frost has passed. Obtain jicama seeds. Soak the seeds. Choose a good location. Make sure the location has good soil. Water the seeds. Dig small holes. Place the jicama seeds in the soil. Lightly water the planted jicama seeds. Fertilize jicama once a month. Stake the vines of the jicama plant. Check the jicama plants daily for dry soil. Deadhead the blooms. Don’t worry too much about pests. Dig the tubers from underground. Collect the tubers. Store the tubers.
One of the first and easiest steps to warm up your body and your throat before you sing is to open your throat and diaphragm by yawning.  Gently force yourself to yawn by opening your mouth as though you were about to yawn. As you do this, think about yawning, or watch a video of someone yawning to initiate your own yawn.  Repeat this two or three times to fully open your throat and diaphragm.; , Using your abdominal muscles and singing from the right place in your body are very important when you sing. To engage the muscles you should be using, very gently force yourself to let out a small cough. Pay attention to which muscles are involved in that action, as these are the muscles you should be using when you sing.The muscles of the core include the psoas, the pelvic floor, and the diaphragm, among others. Engaging these muscles during singing will help you achieve your fullest voice.  You want your entire body to be relaxed when you sing, because you don’t want to strain your body or your muscles when you sing high notes. To relax your upper body, simply shrug your shoulders, hold them in a hunched position for five seconds, then relax them. Repeat four or five times.Your voice should always come from your diaphragm, but sometimes people will try to push from a higher place on their body instead of the belly when reaching for high notes. To prevent this, continue relaxing your neck and shoulders throughout your warm up, especially when going for high notes.  Because the breath is the mechanism that creates your voice, it’s also important to do a few breathing exercises before singing as well. Two exercises you can do are:As you keep your shoulders and chest relaxed, inhale deeply into your diaphragm, so that your stomach rises slightly. Then exhale slowly from this same place, so that your belly flattens out again. Continue breathing this way for two minutes. Inhale like before, but when you exhale, practice allowing the breath to escape slowly as you make a hissing sound with your mouth. Repeat for one minute.  Tension in your jaw and mouth can also affect your singing, so relax this area before singing. To release this tension:   Place your palms on your cheeks and allow your jaw to open to a natural position. Slowly and gently move your hands around to massage the jaw and facial muscles for one to two minutes., Start by making a basic “hmmm” noise in your throat in your lower range as you exhale a breath. Repeat this five to 10 times, then repeat the same sound with your mouth open for five to 10 breaths. With your mouth open, you should make an “ahhhh” noise.Humming is a great way to warm up and relax the muscles of your throat, face, neck, and shoulders, and it can also help you control your breathing., Once your voice is warmed up with basic humming, begin to warm up for pitch changes by humming do-re-mi up the scale and then back down. Start at the lower end of your pitch range, and when you complete one sweep up and down the scale, go to a higher key and repeat.   Repeat this for four or five ascending keys, then work your way back down those same keys., Lip trills, also called lip buzzing or bubbling, are an exercise that vibrates and warms up your lips as well as your voice. To create the lip trill, you close your lips loosely, pout them slightly, and blow air through them (think of making the sound of a motor or raspberry). Do this for two exhales, then start slowly shaking your head from side to side as you do three or four more lip trills.Repeat the lip trilling and head shaking, and as you do this make a “b” sound with your mouth as you do vocal sweeps starting with a high note and going low, and then coming back up.  Make an “ng” sound in your nose as though you were just saying the final part of the word “sung.” Continue to make this noise as you do three to five pitch sweeps. Every time you go back up and down again, push your voice into a slightly higher and lower pitch range.This exercise helps you warm up the voice gradually, prevents over-exertion of the voice, and helps singers transition between their head and chest voices,which refers to the different places air resonates in the body when creating different sounds and pitches.  Tongue twisters are great for articulation practice, and if you say them in different pitches and at different volumes, they can be a great way to warm up before singing. Some good tongue twisters to try out are:Sally sells sea shells by the sea shore Teaching ghosts to sing Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers Unique New York The tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth Really rural The big, black-backed bumblebee Red letter, yellow letter  , Sometimes songs require a singer to hold a note for an extended period, and if you aren't prepared for this or don’t have the right technique, you may not be able to hold the note for the full length. To practice holding a note:  Expand your ribs, tuck in your lower belly, and relax your shoulders and neck. Inhale slowly as you open your throat, arms, and chest, as though you were just surprised by something. Hold this openness while staying relaxed. This is the same technique you will use to hold a note. Now, choose a note in the middle of your range, repeat the above steps, but this time sing that note and hold it for as long as you can, keeping your throat open and relaxed as you sustain the note.  If you’re going to be singing a song that requires you to hit some high notes, there are ways you can practice for this. The problem with high notes is that you can damage your vocal chords if you strain too hard to hit the notes. To reach high notes without causing damage, you need to:Practice keeping a steady flow of air as you sing. Keep all your muscles relaxed. Keep all your resonance chambers (the throat, mouth, nose, chest, etc.) open as you sing. Pick a song with high notes and practice it in sections until you become comfortable with each section. Practice the song once through without singing the words: instead, vocalize a single sound to go through all the pitches. When you're comfortable with that, sing the song, words and all, through entirely.  A song with low notes can also be difficult to master because with low notes, you can easily lose control of the sound, because your vocal chords relax as the pitch descends.To maintain control of your lower notes, it’s important to keep your throat relaxed and maintain resonance in your face. If you stop feeling the resonance in your face as you reach for lower notes, shake your head from side to side to open your throat and try again. Don’t worry if your volume drops with the lower notes, because lower notes cannot be sung at a loud volume. Instead, focus on maintaining the tone and clarity of the note, rather than the volume of your voice.	Open up your throat. Engage your core. Relax your neck and shoulders. Do a breathing exercise. Release tension in your jaw. Hum. Hum do-re-mi. Do some lip trills. Practice the siren song. Practice tongue twisters in different pitches. Hold a sustained note. Work on hitting high notes. Reach for low notes.
At the very bottom of the refrigerator, you may see a covering over the legs. Many times, this grille can be removed by pulling with your hands. Some grilles will be attached by clips or screws you’ll have to undo first.Consult your owner’s manual for advice when you’re unsure of how to remove the grille.; , Check the legs first for screws or bolts that you’ll need to adjust. While some legs can be rotated freely, some require a wrench or a screwdriver. Refrigerators made by GE, for example, require a flat blade screwdriver.  Look along the top and bottoms of the legs. You’ll either see a slot near the top or a screw or bolt near the bottom. Use a flat-head screwdriver on the slots and an adjustable wrench or pliers on the bolt. Turn clockwise to raise the refrigerator. Turn counterclockwise to lower the refrigerator. Try to get the refrigerator level from left to right.Legs without fasteners, such as those on Whirlpool refrigerators, can be turned to the right to lower the refrigerator and to the left to raise it.If you cannot reach the legs to adjust them, you’ll need someone to lean the refrigerator to the back. Be very careful and don’t tilt it back too far.  Place the level on the top of the refrigerator behind the door. The level will be flat if the refrigerator is even from left to right. Adjust the legs to get the refrigerator even from left to right., Place the level against the bottom of the refrigerator. It should slope slightly to the back. Make sure the front is .25 inches (6.35 mm) higher than the back. Make adjustments to the front legs as necessary., Push the grille back onto the bottom of the refrigerator. Replace any clips or screws.	Remove the grille over the legs. Examine the legs. Rotate the legs. Measure the refrigerator’s tilt with a level. Measure the refrigerator’s slope. Replace the grille.
Some less flammable plant alternatives for close landscaping include Columbine, lavender, Coreopsis and Geranium. You can also plant alternative trees and shrubs further from the house. Some good options include buckthorn, lilac, maple and birch.       Keep the amount of vegetation to a bare minimum in this zone. Your 1st zone should be at least 30 feet (9.14 m) around your house.      ; ,,,   It is very important that your roof is resistant, because it is the most likely to catch fire. Use materials such as fiberglass, metal, clay and concrete.	Replace highly flammable vegetation, such as pine and fir trees, with less flammable species. Trim branches so there is a 15-foot (4.5 meter) gap between any treetops.  , Cut your grass often so the maximum length is 2 inches (5.08 cm).  , Ensure your house and deck are constructed out of fire-resistant materials. Clear debris such as leaves and dead wood from this area.
There are three extremely important nutrients for gardening: nitrogen (N) for leaf and stem growth, phosphorus (P) for roots, fruit, and seed, and potassium (K) for disease resistance and overall health. Young plants may need more phosphorus to focus on leaf growth, and plants typically need much less of these nutrients outside of the growing season. For best results, look up the specific plants you are growing to find out their needs. This is usually given as three "NPK" numbers, telling you the ratio or total amounts of these nutrients in that order.   If you want a detailed report on the nutrients already in your soil, send soil samples to your local extension office or soil-testing laboratory. This is not necessary for most home gardens, unless your plants are suffering from slow growth or color changes.; , Plant and animal matter such as fish emulsion or fish hydrolysate provides the best type of fertilizer for long-term microbial growth, which keeps soil nutrient-rich and porous. Fertilizers synthesized in laboratories typically feed the plant without improving the soil, and in some cases may even have negative effects.   Always protect the hands and face when working with soil additives, as these can contain some bacteria and other health threats.  Instead of a manufactured fertilizer, you may be able to find cheaper, unrefined options from a garden supply store or farm. Manure can add nutrients as well as organic matter that will break down and improve the condition of the soil. Here are a few common options:   Manure should be left to decompose for at least a month before use, to avoid damaging plants. Ask if the farmer is using herbicides on their pasture land. You want to avoid manure from that source, as the herbicide will be present in the manure. Chicken or turkey manure is cheap, but can cause runoff issues in large fields. Cow, sheep, goat, and rabbit manure are higher quality and have a less pungent smell. Add bone meal for phosphorus, or blood meal for nitrogen.  New compost typically takes four to eight months to mature, unless you speed up the process with special bacterial additions. This long term project will greatly benefit both soil texture and nutrients, if you're willing to keep up the process. Set aside a large outdoor container, tightly closed to protect it from animals, but with holes for air flow. Care for it with these techniques:   Begin with about 20% soil, manure, or mature compost; 10 to 30% raw, plant-derived food scraps; and 50 to 70% dry leaves, grass, and yard clippings. Mix these together thoroughly. Keep the compost warm and wet, and throw in raw, non-meat food products from kitchen scraps. Turn the compost with a pitchfork or shovel at least once every week or two, to introduce oxygen that encourages beneficial bacteria. Search for worms in moist areas underneath rocks, and add them to the compost bin. The compost is mature (ready to use) when it clumps together when squeezed, but can easily be broken apart. Plant fibers should still be visible, but the compost should be mostly homogeneous. Try sifting your compost. Compost that falls through the sieve is ready to use. Return larger chunks back to the compost bin.  Whether they use solid fertilizer, rotted manure, or compost, most gardeners mix the addition thoroughly into the soil. Many crops do well with a 30% compost, 70% soil mix, but vegetables and fruits often do better with lower amounts of compost. Fertilizer amounts vary greatly depending on the concentration; follow the instructions for your particular plant.   The "no-till" or "no-dig" gardening movement advocates adding the material to the surface, letting it decompose gradually into the soil. Practitioners consider this a more natural and less invasive way to improve soil, although full results may take years and plentiful organic matter. Add in autumn for best results. Many plants benefit from a "top up" every month or two during the growing season, but this varies between species and varieties. If you think the manure or compost may not be rotted enough, keep a circle of regular soil around plants to avoid burning them.  There are many trace elements that have a less important or less direct effect, but can cause plant health issues or poor soil if they fall below required levels. If you want to be sure to include these, mix green sand, kelp meal, or Azomite © into the soil before planting. For small home gardens, you may not find this necessary unless your plants develop health issues.   The most important trace elements are iron, boron, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. The additives described here are natural and suitable for organic farming.  If you plant the same type of plant in the same location year after year, it will deplete the soil nutrients more quickly. Some plants will use fewer nutrients or even add nitrogen to the soil, so a rotating schedule of plants each year will keep the nutrient levels more stable.   For home gardening, get started with this simple guide to crop rotation. For farming, consult an experienced local farmer or agricultural extension office, as the rotation plan varies depending on the available crops. Farmers can also consider using overwinter "cover crops" grown to provide nutrients for the real crop. Plant a cold-hardy crop at least 30 days before the first expected frost, or 60 days if the crop is only marginally cold-hardy. Mow or cut the crop at least three or four weeks before the regular crop is planted, and leave the cover crop on the ground to decay. You can also plant a quick growing summer cover crop, such as buckwheat. This will allow you to improve and prepare the soil without having to grow a large crop over the entirety of the summer. Till the crop 30 days after planting., If your soil is kept well-aerated and supplied with nutrients, microbe populations will grow on their own, breaking down dead plant matter into nutrients your plants can reuse. For additional soil health, you may be able to purchase bacterial or fungal additions from a garden supply store, if they are suitable for your plant species. Soil that already decomposes rapidly does not need these additions, although there is no hard and fast rule for how much to use or when to stop.One of the most common additions is a type of fungus called mycorrhizae. This attaches to plant roots and help them absorb more nutrients and water. All plants except members of the genus Brassica (including mustard and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and bok choy) benefit from this, unless the soil is already in excellent shape. Bacteria called rhizobium are often already present in the soil, but you can purchase a rhizobium inoculant to be sure. These form a symbiotic relationship with legumes such as potatoes and beans, adding nitrogen to the soil.  Soil scientists divide the particles that make up soil into three categories. Sand particles are the largest, silt is somewhat smaller, and clay particles are the smallest. The ratio of these three types determines the type of soil you have, described in a chart called the "soil triangle." For most plants, you'll want to aim for a "loam," or approximately a 40-40-20 mix of sand, silt, and clay respectively.   Succulents and cacti often prefer a "sandy loam" with 60 or 70% sand instead.  Pick up a small clump of soil, from beneath the top surface layer. Moisten it, then try to roll it into a ball and flatten it into a ribbon. This quick and dirty method can detect major problems, based on the following diagnosis:If your soil ribbon breaks before it reaches 2.5 cm (1 inch), you have loam or silt. (If it can't form a ball or ribbon at all, you have sandy soil.) If your ribbon measures 2.5 to 5 cm (1–2 inches) before breaking, you have clay loam. Your soil could probably benefit from more sand and silt. If your ribbon reaches more than 5 cm (2 inches), you have clay. Your soil will need major additives, as described at the end of this section.  If you're still not sure about your soil, you can find out more accurate information with twenty minutes of work and a few days of waiting. To get started, discard the surface soil, then dig up a sample of your soil about 15 centimeters (6 in) deep. Spread it out on a newspaper to dry, and remove all trash, rocks, and other large debris. Break up clumps of soil, separating it as much as possible.  Once the soil is dry, add it to a tall, large jar until the jar is ¼ full. Add water until the jar is ¾ full, then add 5 milliliters (1  tsp) of non-foaming dishwasher detergent.Seal the jar and shake it for at least five minutes to further break it into fragments.  Let the jar stand for at least a couple days, marking the outside with a marker or tape at these intervals:After one minute, mark the jar at the top of the settled particles. These are sand, which settle first due to their larger size. After two hours, mark the jar again. By now, most of the silt will have settled above the sand. Once the water is clear, mark the jar a third time. Soil with heavy clay can take a week or two to settle, while more loamy soils may reach a clear jar after a couple days. Measure the distance between marks to get the amount of each particle. Divide each measurement by the total height of the particles to get the percentage of that particle type. For example, if you have 5 cm (2 in) of sand and a total 10 cm (4 in) layer of particles, your soil is 5 ÷ 10 = 0.5 = 50% sand.  If you discover you already have loam, there's no need to alter your soil. Clay soils greatly benefit from mature compost, as described in the soil nutrients section. Other natural additions such as dry leaves or grass clippings serve similar purposes.   Old, weathered wood chips, twigs, or bark will increase water and nutrient retention, both by creating soil pores and soaking up materials for slow release. Ramial wood chips or chips from small branches are the most nutrient dense when it comes to improving soil. Avoid new wood, which can reduce soil nitrogen levels.  If you have clay-heavy soil (more than 20% clay) or extremely sandy or silty soil (more than 60% sand or 60% silt), you can mix in the other types of soil to achieve a roughly even mix of sand and silt, and no more than 20% clay. This can be labor-intensive, but is faster than creating your own compost. The goal is to create a porous soil that can hold plenty of water, air, and nutrients.   If you have a commercial composting operation nearby, you can purchase compost in bulk, typically by the truckload. You can use this compost instead of making your own. Note that you should only use sand that is salt-free and very sharp.Perlite, available from garden supply stores, is useful for all soil types but especially for clay soils, essentially acting as extra-large particles.  Keep foot traffic and vehicle traffic to a minimum to keep the soil aerated. If the soil looks dense or crusted on top, use a pitchfork to turn over the soil and break up large clumps. For seriously compacted soil, use a machine tiller, or plug holes with a lawn aerator. Even if water retention is not an issue, densely compacted soil can kill off beneficial bacteria and fungi, and encourage harmful anaerobic bacteria.   Mixing in organic material also helps, as described in the section on soil nutrients. Daikon or tillage radishes, dandelions, and other plants with long tap roots can help prevent clumping and compaction.Alternatively, you can follow "no-till" or "no-dig" gardening techniques to leave soil undisturbed, allowing it to form as natural soil does over a few years. Minimizing traffic is still recommended for this method.  For accurate results, discard the topsoil until you reach soil with a consistent color and texture, typically about 5 cm (2 in) down. Dig a hole 15 cm (6 in) deep. Repeat several times across your yard or field to get a representative set of samples.  You can send these soil samples to a local extension office or soil-testing laboratory, and pay them to test the soil's pH, or acidity. However, pH testing kits are cheaply available at garden supply stores or nurseries, and easy to conduct at home.   Sending the samples to a professional is recommended for farmers, so you can receive an exact recommendation for how much additive to use. Home gardeners may wish to go with the cheaper, faster kit, and use trial and error with the additives.  Many plants prefer a slightly acidic soil, so aim for a pH of 6.5 if you don't have any other information. Ideally, find your plant's preferences online or by talking to an experienced gardener.   If you can't find specific pH levels, assume that "acidic soils" mean a pH of 6.0 to 6.5, while "alkaline soil" means a pH of 7.5 to 8.  If your soil pH is too low for your plant, raise the soil pH with these alkaline additions. Check a garden supply store for garden lime, crushed oyster shells, or other calcium supplements, or crush egg shells to a powder at home. Mix the additive into a large amount of soil one handful at a time, testing the soil pH each time. Keep in mind that these additives can take weeks or months to change the pH of the soil. Wait until you start noticing results before making any more additions.  If you need to lower your soil pH level, you'll need an acidic addition instead. Mix in aluminum sulfate or sulfur from a gardening supply store, testing the pH again after each handful added.   There are no consistent home methods for raising soil pH. Scientific tests show that pine needles and coffee grounds do not have a reliable, significant effect on soil acidity, despite widespread advice to the contrary., Over time, your soil pH will gradually return to its usual levels, which is determined mostly by the type of minerals in your area. Unless you are having trouble adjusting the pH or your plants develop growth problems, testing your soil every three years should be fine.	Check which nutrients your plants need. Choose fertilizers from organic sources. Consider using manure or other organic matter. Make your own compost. Add the fertilizing material. Add trace elements. Consider crop rotation. Consider adding beneficial fungi or bacteria. Understand the soil triangle. Try a quick texture test. Prepare a soil sample for thorough testing. Mix ingredients for a jar test. Mark the jar as the soil settles. Improve your soil with compost or natural debris. Consider manual soil adjustment. Deal with soil compaction. Take a soil sample. Test the soil pH. Check your plant's needs. Make the soil more alkaline. Make soil more acidic. Test your soil every three years.
Yeah, just... Relax. Singing doesn't work under stress.Nerves? Those are okay, if channeled into positive energy. However, panic attacks? Not so much.  However, this isn't meant in the way you've probably learned. There's two sets of chords or flaps in your throat- The vocal chords and these other pesky ones that like to get in the way. If you open your mouth and close your throat, your air will be cut off. Now open it- You'll probably feel a light clicking sensation and can breathe almost silently. Congrats, you've retracted! That's a new way to breathe that could just turn around the way you sing.  Actually, as you start out, you should sound TERRIBLE. However, by making those clear sounds and practicing them, you're training your voice to make unpleasant noises with the right technique. All that's left now is what you could do with just about any teacher- Make those noises more pleasant.  Don't overexert, but just keep practicing and singing things until you start to sound more desirable. People over-complicate singing, yet simultaneously under-complicate it. You just need to keep exploring.  This is what causes the demise of many singers. If you feel a sharp fuzzy feeling in your throat or are feeling uncomfortable in any way, STOP! Drink some water and take a break. Also, if you're feeling balls of phlegm coming out of your system or getting lodged in your throat, cough them up rather than swallow them.	Relax. Open your throat. Try to make sharp, clear, resonant sounds rather than rounded, fuzzy ones that sound nice. Make those unbearable noises pleasant. Know your limits.
Amps with a simple layout will have a single volume knob. More commonly, you will see 2 knobs, labeled "Pre" and "Post,” or “Drive” and “Master.” The first knob in each of these pairs adjusts the signal before it enters the power amplification stage, while the second knob adjusts the signal after power amplification. Start around 2 on the dial of your master volume.  The pre or drive knob will have a much more dramatic effect on the overall tone of your guitar. The pre knob allows you to produce a distorted tone. This is because the power amplification stage cannot cleanly handle input signals past a certain level. Turn the "Pre" knob higher to achieve a distorted signal.The post or master knob has a less dramatic effect on tone, but handles the overall volume of the amp. The master knob will not affect the distortion of the signal. If the pre knob is set high, set the post knob low to achieve a distorted sound at a reasonable listening volume. If the pre knob is set low, turn the post knob higher to produce a clean tone.  All guitar amps contain some form of equalization (EQ), often in the form of bass, mid, and high frequencies. Experiment with the EQ on your amp to find a tone you enjoy. The best way to get an idea of the amp’s natural tone is by setting each EQ to “twelve o’clock.”Twelve o’clock means that the knob is set directly in the middle. The term comes from the face of a clock. Some amps simplify the equalization to a single knob, labeled “tone.” Adjust the knob high to produce a higher frequency to give your guitar a brighter tone. Move the knob to a lower position to emphasize low frequencies that will produce a warmer, darker tone.  Some guitar amps will have a button labeled "Channel." This button is used to switch between clean and distorted channels, which will provide you with a quick way to increase the level of distortion. Pressing this button has the same effect as turning up the pre-gain knob and turning down the post-gain knob.   Some guitar amps come with a pedal to switch between channels on the fly., The gain knob on your amp is designed to increase the distortion of your guitar's sound. In effect, the gain knob also increases the volume. Not all guitar amps come with gain settings. Some guitarists value this effect so much that they purchase several pedals that produce this sound like, overdrive and distortion effects pedals.Gain is particularly useful if you play rock or blues music. Some players like to increase the gain on the amp right before a guitar solo.  Before settling on an amp, you should visit a music store and try out multiple amps. Each model and brand has an unique sound that is worth being experimented with. You'll see difference in the "American sound" with brands like Fender, and the "U.K. sound" with brands like Marshall and Vox.   Some guitarists even prefer to play out of a bass amp. Determine if you like the tube sound over solid state amps or vice versa - tubes tend to give a more classic, warm tone to your playing but require additional maintenance and care.	Adjust the volume of your guitar amp. Use the volume to effect the tone. Adjust the EQ of your guitar's tone. Switch between channels if available. Use gain on your amp. Play with multiple amps.
Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine. Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly.   If you have a gas dryer, you will also want to shut off the gas.; , You've probably noticed that lint gets everywhere. There seems to be a cloud of it anytime you open your dryer or fiddle with the trap. Of course, this means that lint works its way into all the cracks and crevices of your machine and you'll want to be sure to clean it at least once a year to prevent problems.   A dryer blocked up with lint can dry inefficiently and even cause fires. The lint trap should, of course, be cleaned out after every use. This is very important because if you don't, new lint won't have anywhere to go, creating a mess and increasing the amount of time needed to dry a load of clothes.  Use a vacuum cleaner to clean out behind the lint trap every few weeks to every few months, depending on how much lint your items create and how well your trap catches the lint.Pull out the lint trap and vacuum the tube that is on the other side. You might also want to vacuum out the exhaust tubes, although these are often difficult to reach or inaccessible.  The moisture sensor, which is on most modern machines, tells your dryer when the clothes are dry. If it's covered in lint it won't work correctly, which can lead to your dryer turning off before everything is dry. Wipe the bar down with rubbing alcohol to clean it and keep your dryer running correctly.   These are usually found near the lint trap or at the back of the machine. They will look like two long, silver strips of metal and are usually surrounded by or mounted on plastic. If you don't clean these often, you might need to scrub with something a little more substantial, like a Magic Eraser.  Much like you can lift the top of your stove to clean below the heating elements, you can open up your dryer if you're brave and clean the lint that builds up around the drum. Different dryers open in different ways, so check the user manual for your model or look it up online.   Generally, either the top or front panel will come off (or both). Look for screws around the lint filter, since this is usually the spot to start. With the screws undone, the panel can be removed, though there is sometimes a catch you will have to get around by pulling forward (for a top panel) or using a screwdriver at the gap (for a front panel).With the panel removed and the drum exposed, remove lint and lost items by hand or with a vacuum.  Once you're done, snap the panels back into place and then replace the screws.	Unplug the dryer. Clean your lint trap with every use and your dryer as a whole once a year. Clean the lint trap with a vacuum. Wipe down the moisture sensor. Open the panel surrounding the drum. Put it back together.
This only works for chords starting on the sixth string, but this makes it easy to play a seventh chord anywhere. Imagine that the open strings were actually a barred fret -- they are all the same "fret" being sounded out in your chord. This means your other two fingers will make any chord "barred" a 7th. Since the next E begins on the 12th fret, your E7 barre chord would look like:          --12-- --12-- --13-- --12-- --14-- --12--  , When barring chords on the 5th string, you can use the same strategy to move your chord anywhere as the one used in the last step. However, you must use the form of an A7 chord, because an open A7 resembles a barre chord on the A string the same way an open E7 resembles a barre chord on the E string. For an E7, you'd start on the 5th string, 7th fret, an E, and play the following form:          --7-- --9-- --7-- --9-- --7-- --X--   Note: If you moved this form all the way to the open strings, so you only fret the second string on the 2nd and 4th strings, this is an open A7 chord.	Use your index finger to barre over the open-E7 form to make any chord a seventh. Learn an E7 barre chord on the fifth fret.
Encourage your to stick with their and have fun with what they are doing. Some teens may have unique or odd hobbies that you don’t understand. Don’t discourage them or tell them how weird you find it. This could hurt a core part of your teen’s personality. Instead, support their interests.It would be terrible to convince your teen to do something and then be too busy to help them enjoy it. Always be proud of what your teen accomplishes. If you know a lot about the hobby, offer a small amount of constructive criticism if asked. Avoid taking over a project. Remember, this is their hobby and project, not yours.  One of the most important things you can do is help structure family life so that there is time to enjoy hobbies.This means making sure there is some free time for the teen, along with making sure this free time is not devoured by things like video games, social media, and TV.Provide resources and support. You are probably the one in charge of funding the hobbies to some extent. You may also have knowledge, expertise, and social connections that might help out. Place limits on media use. For example, no video games after dinnertime. Instead, your teen can spend time on their hobby. Avoid over-scheduling. Sometimes there is a fine line between a happily occupied, busy kid and one that has no time to just hang around with friends at the comic book store.  You are most likely to get a positive response to your teen choosing a hobby if you engage in hobbies. By participating in a hobby, you are modeling how rewarding and fun hobbies can be and how important they are for a balanced life.For example, if you want your child to read for fun, model this behavior by reading in your spare time and talking about books.  Teenagers are constantly changing, growing, and discovering new things. If your child does not want to do a hobby, respect it. A teen may have been really excited about knitting last year, but not this year.Insisting your teen finish a class, camp, or semester is sometimes a tough call. Some teens have a tendency to give up too easily and need a parent to help prevent them from quitting too quickly. Generally, insisting on finishing a certain amount of time will help prevent that, like a week-long tennis camp. However, if it really looks like a teen is not having fun, discontinuing the hobby may well be wise.  Sure, doing things together is one of the great pleasures of being a parent. But parents and children may not share the same hobbies. The idea behind hobbies is to enjoy it for its own sake, whether or not your child shares the same hobbies. Don’t force your teen to like only what you like or discourage hobbies that you do not understand.For example, it may be easy to make fun of a teen's achievements in Minecraft. But doing so would certainly put them off to opening up to you. Sometimes you may not think you have the exact same interest, but discover they are not so different. For instance, maybe your teen shows no interest in playing poker, but they love getting together and playing role-playing games.	Be supportive of your teen’s hobbies. Structure life to support hobbies. Participate in a hobby of your own. Respect your teen’s changing interests. Remember that your teen may not share your hobbies.
Violets need to be grown in a semi-shaded position but are fairly tolerant provided they do not dry out. They need to be protected from the hot afternoon sun in hot climates but if you live in a cool climate, you can grow them in full sun.; , Soil pH should be around 6.0 - 7.5; add lime to lessen acidic soils. The soil should be well-drained. Enrich it with well-decayed compost and/or manure. If you have clay soils, add plenty of grit, decayed vegetable refuse and manure; light and gravelly soils should be improved through the addition of a liberal amount of cow manure and loam or clay mixed in. If grown in the open, the violets prefer a moderately heavy rich soil.  If you already have some violet plants growing, or know someone who has established violets, use these for propagation. Simply break off a small section that has roots, pot it up for a few weeks until established and then plant out. Spring or autumn is perhaps the best time to do this, but you will probably find that it works well just about any time. This should be done every 2 years once you have an established violet garden, to achieve best growing results. If you have seeds, note that seed is best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. The seed requires a period of cold stratification and the germination of stored seed can be erratic. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer.  Plant either in rows or in a more creative pattern that suits your garden space.  Violets need a moist soil and should not be allowed to dry out. , The flowers are usually produced in abundance in late winter and early spring.	Choose a suitable position. Choose good soil. Propagate by dividing old violet plants. Space violet plants 25—30 centimeter (11.8 in) apart. Water well. Keep free of weeds.  , Harvest leaves and/or flowers as wished.
Order parts from retailers that are well known and have a good reputation such as Newegg and Amazon.; , You do not have to stick to my "$600" budget play around with it if you want as long as it suits your needs and you can afford it by all means go ahead.  Makes sure all your parts have good reviews and ratings read all of the reviews some people post thoughtless and meaningless reviews whether they are good or bad. You do not want to end up with a part that fails or does not work properly.  There are 2 choices for operating systems in all custom PCs. Microsoft windows or the open source so Linux. Installing Mac OS X on a custom PC aka "Hackintosh" is illegal. ,	Choose your parts. Figure out your budget. Check the reviews on products and watch product reviews. Choose an operating system. Make sure all parts are compatible with each other and your operating system.  , Buy a case and monitor and assemble your computer.
This will help you choose gardening tools that will not break or fall apart after taking them home.   Verify that the welded parts of equipment such as shovels or garden rakes are attached firmly to handles and other counterparts. Look for signs of heavy flaking or multiple pits on tools or equipment that contain metal, which can indicate that the tools are excessively worn and may not work effectively.  This will help you verify that the wood will not split or break apart after use.   Look for signs of cracks, rot, or breaks in the wood. If any of these deficiencies exist, the tool may break shortly after use. Closely examine wood that has been painted over. In some cases, paint can be covering damages or other defects in the tools or equipment.  Gardening equipment such as tillers or lawn mowers with motors should be tested.   Turn on or start the equipment before finalizing the sale to verify that the motor or engine works efficiently.	Examine the gardening tools for efficiency before purchasing. Examine the wooden parts of gardening equipment before buying. Verify that equipment with motors work properly.
For roses and similarly sized plants, they should be planted about 1ft (30cm) apart.Plant them in a nursery bed and care for them according to the needs of the species and variety. They can be raised from seeds or cuttings, but they will need to be planted enough in advance that they have sizable, woody stems by the time the scion plant is budding.   Unlike other forms of grafting, which attach a portion of the main plant, budding only requires the scion plant to form buds. This means the scion plant can be a different age or size than the rootstock. See Understanding Grafting Basics to learn about rootstock and scion plants.  If the weather is hot and dry, water the rootstock plants heavily for two weeks before grafting. This helps make the bark soft and easy to cut and manipulate., The cut should be about 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) above the ground. The vertical portion of the T shape should be 1–1.5 inches (2.5–4 cm) long, and the horizontal portion should cover about 1/3 the distance around the stem.There should be two flaps of bark, each on one side of the vertical cut, that can be lifted away from the trunk slightly.   Roses and small flowering bushes may be cut 2–4 inches (5–10cm) above the ground instead.As always when cutting into the trunks or stems of plants, it's a good idea to use a sterilized, sharp knife and to wear latex gloves. This reduces the chance your plant will get infected.  Select a shoot from the scion plant that is growing strongly and healthily, and remove one of its buds. Cut into the wood at an angle to remove a strip of wood beginning 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) below the bud, and ending about 3/4–1 inch (1.9–2.5cm) above it.Carefully pull away this piece of wood, cutting it off from the branch if necessary.  Gently ease the flaps of bark on either side of the T apart to reveal green wood underneath, called the cambium layer. Insert the strip of wood containing the bud, with the bud pointed upward. Push it carefully into the vertical T cut until the bud is just below the horizontal cut of the T.Each piece should have a layer of green wood lying against each other. You may need to practice several times to cut the plants to the correct level. One rootstock plant can receive several scion buds., You can purchase a special gardening material for this purpose called budding rubber. Otherwise, use wide rubber bands or green tie tape.Do not cover the bud with the wrapping.  The cuts will take anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks to heal, depending on season.Once the plant looks healthy and the cuts have healed over, remove the binding.  You don't want the rootstock to grow more shoots, but don't remove it all immediately. Cut the rootstock stem off approximately 12–14 inches (20–30 cm) above where the bud was attached, or a few inches above it if you are working with a small plant. This "nurse branch" will help protect the vulnerable place where the two plants were joined.  Once the wood inserted from the scion has become established and grown a few new leaves, remove the remainder of the rootstock branch above the joint. Cut it down almost the entire way, to about 1/8 in (3 mm) above where the bud was joined. This will put all of the plant's energy into growing the new scion.	Plant the rootstock plants in advance. Prepare to graft the plants in cool weather when the scion plant is budding. Make a T-shaped cut on the rootstock plant. Cut a healthy bud and attached wood from the scion plant. Insert the bud wood into the T cut. Tie the plants together. Wait for it to heal before removing the binding. Cut the rootstock branch some distance above the new bud. Once the bud wood has grown a few new leaves, remove the rest of the rootstock branch.
If your video recorder is not available, then borrow one or buy one. This is a critical need. Visit every room and open every cabinet so that a count may be taken later if necessary. Closely scrutinize and document higher value items to assess the relative wear and tear. Don’t forget to closely document your furniture and its condition as mars and scraps can occur afterwards from moving and may necessitate repair. Pretend that everything was destroyed or not returned and videotape enough information to be able to document the asset. Don’t forget the basement, closets or storage areas. Use as much videotape time as needed. Have multiple copies made of the videotape to share with insurance and furniture restorers, and a base copy.; , Pay attention to molding and trim, woodwork details, built-in stereo systems and in-ceiling speakers, closet systems, bathroom and kitchen details such as mirrors, fixtures, lighting, cabinetry, flooring & outlets. Take photographs also of every room and the furniture so that the details may be easily shared. If your camera is indisposed, then buy several instant ones or borrow one. Have multiple copies made of the videotape to share with construction personnel, insurance, subcontractors, and a base copy.  Do not give that to the insurance contractor or insurance adjuster. Instead, make them document to you everything in the house that requires replacement before the demolition destroys the evidence so that you can concur with the listing. Make it a precondition to not demolish items that have not been documented to you yet. Sample listings are included in the appendix. If you are unsure of the model or type, remember that most manufacturers can tell the information from a serial number so notate all serial numbers in your listing of contents.  Retain any items of value that you may want in your possession and not risk to a third party loss. Pay particular attention to jewelry, sentimental items of value, artwork, items necessary to your work/lifestyle, and items required for your financial and medical needs in your retention of materials. Take small sample remnants of the carpeting by room. Your value for carpet will be subject to whatever samples they choose to submit so retain a remnant of each room.  Use their information to document the colors present in the various rooms of the house and exterior. Make a chart of all previous selections and use that to notate the new selections. Example is in the appendix.	Video tape your contents slowly and carefully. Go back and videotape the actual house and architecture. Make a notebook of all housing contents and literature that you hold in your files. Retain any papers throughout the house that may surmise the value of any item. Do not dispose of leftover cans of paint initially.
, Take the top right corner and fold in half. Make sure to create a nice crease in the paper.  Now place your paper with the long side facing you. You should have a nice creased line down the center of your page.  Take the right corner and fold it over making sure that the edge of the paper follows the crease you’ve just created. Now do the same with the left corner. Fold it over making sure that the edge of the paper follows the crease you’ve just created. Make sure to keep them even. , Now you should only see a big triangle.  Make sure that the single point is at the top before you fold it in half. Take the bottom right side and fold over to the left. Make a clean crease in the middle.  Now you should have a crease running vertically in the center of your newspaper. ,, Now you have your hat.   Decorate accordingly. Try coloring the different parts of the hat with paint, markers, or crayons. Paste fabrics on the side.

Take both bottom corners and fold to the center aligning it with the crease.  , Tape the two corners together.  , Open up the bottom.
Your state will require your insurer to file this certificate in a variety of situations. Although the precise situations might differ by state, the following are common:You were convicted of DUI/DWI. You were driving without insurance. You were involved in an accident that caused serious bodily injury. Your driving record has a large number of points.; , An FR-44 is like an SR-22. However, the SR-22 only states that you have bought your state’s minimum required insurance. An FR-44 certifies that you have bought a level of insurance higher than your state’s minimum.For example, in Florida, you’ll need to purchase at least $100,000 in liability insurance if you must file an FR-44.Look at your court order to see which one you are required to get. You can also check with your state’s DMV office. You will still get an FR-44 the same way you get an SR-22.  You need to have an insurer issue your SR-22. You can’t do this yourself. Instead, the insurer must send the certificate directly to your state. Accordingly, call up your current insurer and tell them you need an SR-22 filed.   Some insurers don’t file SR-22 certificates. In that situation, you must shop around for new insurance and buy a policy with an insurer that will issue the certificate.Avoid keeping your current insurance but shopping for an insurer that does provide SR-22 certificates. This type of dual insurance is illegal.Don’t think that you can avoid telling your insurer because you are moving out of state. Your current state will still record your license suspension in a national computer system. Before you can get a license in another state, they will check to make sure you have followed your former state’s rules. This means you must still file an SR-22 certificate with your former state., Insurers will charge different amounts to file the certificate. However, you generally will need to pay $15-25.Check with your insurer about whether you get a copy.   An SR-22 certificate isn’t like an insurance card that you keep with you. What’s important is that the certificate be noted on your driving record. Nevertheless, your insurer might send you a copy if you want one. Call and check. Confirm that it was sent to your state’s office. It can generally take up to 30 days to be sent and processed.  You can probably expect your insurance costs to increase because of the DUI or serious accident.Many people who need an SR-22 filed are considered high-risk drivers. Accordingly, talk with your insurer about whether your premiums will rise.   Whatever you do, don’t turn around and cancel your coverage because the premium is now too high. If you cancel your coverage, then your insurer must report this fact to your state’s DMV office.You could lose your license if you don’t pick up another insurance policy. If you want to switch policies, then make sure you have another policy in place before cancelling.  Your state can require that you file the SR-22 certificate even when you aren’t a car owner. You will need non-owner SR-22 insurance, which you may have to shop around for.Don’t get a non-owner policy if a vehicle is still registered to you or if someone lets you drive a car regularly. Only purchase non-owner’s insurance when you have no car and no regular access to one. If you choose to purchase a car, then contact your insurer immediately. They will change your policy to an owner’s policy.  You need to carry the SR-22 for several years. The exact amount of time differs by state, but many states require it for at least three years.Check with your state’s DMV office.   The amount of time might differ depending on your offense.You should also check if you can be relieved from filing. Call up your state’s office and ask if they can review your record. In some situations, they might relieve you of the requirement to file an SR-22., Each state has minimum insurance requirements. If you have to shop for a new policy because your insurer won’t issue an SR-22, then you need to know these minimum requirements. You can check with your state’s DMV office.   Generally, states will require that you have liability insurance to cover injuries to all people in an accident as well as property damage. Your state’s requirements might read 25/50/25. This means that you need at least $25,000 of coverage for injuries to one person, $50,000 of liability coverage for injuries to all people, and $25,000 of coverage to property damage.Remember that you’ll need to get more than your state’s minimum if you need an FR-44 certificate issued. You might also decide to purchase more than the minimum to protect you in case of an accident. For example, you could purchase insurance to cover your own injuries if the other driver doesn’t have insurance.  Insurers will request common information, so you should gather this information ahead of time to speed up the process. Gather the following:the type and amount of liability coverage you want your car’s make, model, year, and vehicle identification number (VIN) age and sex of the drivers number of drivers where you park your car for the night  , You can get quotes online or by calling insurers. National insurance companies have agents all over the country, which you can find in your phone book. Also look for smaller insurers, who may advertise in the phone book or online.   You can also use online aggregators. They will take your information and then request quotes from many different insurers at once. You’ll need to follow up with an agent, but these aggregators are a good way to check at a glance how much each insurer will charge you. Nerdwallet with allow you to compare insurance quotes from many different insurers., If you talk to an agent, make sure to mention that you need an SR-22. You need to know whether the insurer will issue one. You should also call if you got online quotes.   If an insurer doesn’t issue SR-22 certificates, then cross them off your list.  Once you have quotes, compare the prices and the amount of coverage offered. You might want to purchase the cheapest insurance, but make sure it is equivalent to the others. For example, the cheapest insurance could offer the least coverage.Analyze whether the policies have deductibles. This is the amount of money you will need to pay before your coverage kicks in. Generally, the higher your deductible the lower your premiums. Also compare coverage limits. The more coverage you get, the higher your premiums. Consider the insurance company’s reputation. Visit your state’s Department of Insurance and check the number of complaints consumers have lodged against the insurer.  Check that it includes all the coverage you requested.If anything seems wrong, then contact the agent to change the policy. Only sign the policy once you agree with everything in it.   Ask your insurance agent questions if you don’t understand anything in the policy.  An SR-22 is proof that you have insurance, now and in the future. Accordingly, you might not be able to continue to pay monthly premiums. Instead, you might need to pay the entire premium upfront.If you don’t have the money in your checking account, think about paying the premium with a credit card. Even if you don’t have to pay upfront, it might be a good idea to. If you miss a payment, then your coverage could be cancelled and you might lose your license. By paying upfront, you protect against any missed payments.	Identify if you need an SR-22. Check if you need an FR-44 instead. Ask your insurer to file the SR-22 certificate. Pay a fee. Discuss how much your premiums will be. Get the certificate even if you don’t own a car. Maintain your coverage. Determine how much you need. Gather required information. Obtain quotes. Tell an agent you need an SR-22. Compare policies. Review your policy. Purchase the policy upfront.
For an example lets say it's 12 feet 6 inches (15.2 cm).; , For example lets say its 15 feet (4.6 m).  Fro example lets say its 3 and 3/4 inches.  Do search online to find them.  Engineers scale is basically taking a foot (12 inches) and converting it into10ths. The engineers scale also eliminates the  fractions of an inch. (i.e. 3/4 of an inch is equal to 0.75 of an inch)  ,   6 inches (15.2 cm) / 12 = 0.50 feet (0.2 m).  Put the .50 after the 12. Now we have 12.5 feet (3.8 m). , Take the top number 3 and divide it by the bottom number 4.    3 / 4 = 0.75 of an inch. Put the .75 after the 3. We now have 3.75 inches (9.5 cm). Now take 3.75 and divide that by 12. 3.75 / 12 = 0.31 feet (0.1 m).   Now we have L = 12.5 feet (3.8 m), W = 15 feet (4.6 m) and H = 0.31 feet (0.1 m).  12.5 x 15 x 0.31 = 58.25 cubic feet.  58.25 / 27 = 2.15 Cubic Yards.	Measure the Length (L). Measure the Width (W). Measure the Height (H). Use a Construction Calculator. If you're calculating for Cubic Feet or Cubic Yards of Concrete needed, you will need to convert your inch measurements to Engineers Scale. For the L measurement of 12 feet 6 inches (15.2 cm), take the 6 inches (15.2 cm) and divide it by 12. At 15 feet (4.6 m) and 0 inches (0.0 cm) the W does not need to be converted.  , For the H measurement of 3 and 3/4 inches, we will first need to convert the fraction 3/4 of an inch to a decimal. Multiply them altogether. To calculate the Cubic Yards take the 58.25 cubic feet and divide it by 27.
There are 88 keys on a piano. White piano keys are called naturals because they make a natural note when pressed. Black piano keys are called accidentals because they make a sharp or flat note when pressed.There are seven naturals on the keyboard: C-D-E-F-G-A-B There are five accidentals per octave and they can either be sharp or flat. Learn the names of the left-hand and right-hand staff : bass clef and treble clef  , Since you don’t have a teacher, let instructional books be your guide. There are many books available in both specialty music stores and regular book stores that will take you through a step-by-step process of learning how to read music, play basic scales, chord progressions and then simple songs.Utilize multi-media tools such as DVDs. YouTube videos also are a valuable source. If you are a visual learner, these tools will suit you well because you can see the music being played correctly.  You will need to learn where the notes are located on the piano, what they sound like and how the note is written on the staff. To do that, you can make flash cards to identify the notes on the staff.You can purchase stickers to place on your piano to help you learn the placement of the notes. You also can purchase books that help beginners learn how to read notes.   Familiarize yourself with common chords. Start with the chords in majors. Then follow with the minors., Use the instructional books to help you learn how to play the notes. Playing the notes with the correct fingers is just as important as learning where the notes are located. If you don’t practice using the correct method, then you’ll have trouble playing up and down the scales., Playing scales helps you familiarize yourself with the notes and the sound of them. If you are learning how to sight read ,playing music while you sight read helps you learn where the notes are located and what they look like on the staff. Play the scales for each hand one at time. Then play together.  Using your instructional books, go through the lessons. They will teach you to play easy songs as well as mastering finger placement. Practicing with easy songs also helps you to memorize where the notes are located, which improves your sight reading abilities. Start with C major. Then, work your way through the minor keys, so that you can familiarize yourself with them.   When you’re practicing a piece of music, try to play the melody and bass lines for each hand separately at first. Once your playing of each improves, then practice playing them together.  Learning to play the piano requires a lot of practice. Play with sheet music to get better at sight reading, fingering and playing. Plan on practicing about three to four times a week for about a half hour. Don’t move on to the next lesson until you’ve mastered the previous lesson.	Learn some basic piano knowledge. Use Instructional books. Study the notes. Learn finger placement. Practice playing scales. Learn some easy songs. Practice, practice, practice.
Fescue grows when the soil temperature is above 60° F (15° C). The air temperature will be between 70-80° F (21-27° C). The ideal climate occurs in spring before the temperature starts to climb for summer. It also occurs again in autumn as temperatures fall.Planting fescue in fall is the best bet for a healthy lawn.; , Fescue does best in slightly acidic soil. Get a testing kit from a garden center before planting time. Perform the test before planting so you don’t waste time and money on a disappointing growth. The proper soil for fescue has a pH between six and seven.Treat acidic soil with garden lime. Treat alkaline soil with compost or other soil conditioners.  Unless you are reseeding a fescue lawn, get a weed killer that lists glyphosate on the label. Glyphosate will kill all plants, including grass. Spray the weed killer over the area once or twice to remove all vegetation.When reseeding, you may try a gentler herbicide safe for grasses. To protect the fescue, it is better to mow or pull out the weeds by hand.  Get a garden tiller or tractor tiller. Move back and forth from one side of the planting area to the other. The tiller should reach six inches (15 cm) deep, and you may wish to go back over the area a second time to make sure the soil is turned enough. Finish by leveling the soil with a rake.Rent a tiller from a home improvement store if you don’t have one.  Fertilizer can be added before or after you lay the seeds. Choose a starter fertilizer, which provides a balance of nutrients for a new lawn. Fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and include phosphorous and potassium are best for the fescue., You’ll need about five pounds (2 kg) of fescue seed for every 1,000 square feet (93 square meters). Use a seeding device or spread the seeds evenly over the area by hand. Don’t be afraid to spread plenty of seed over the area. This will ensure the lawn looks full once the fescue has grown., Go back over the area with a rake. Drag the rake over the entirety of the soil’s surface to mix in the seeds. A hand roller may also help you smooth out the area., Use an irrigation system or a hose to cover large areas of fescue seed. Apply about an inch of water (2 cm) so that the top inch or two of soil stays moist. This should be done once a week to keep the soil moist until the seeds sprout., Get mulch such as wheat straw or paper straw. You’ll need about 60 to 80 pounds (27-36 kg) per 1,000 square feet (93 square meters). Spread the mulch so it forms a light covering over the soil. Mulch helps the soil retain moisture, causing the fescue to grow faster., Cut the existing fescue down to size so that new seed reaches the soil. Set the lawnmower to cut the grass one to two inches (2-5 cm) high. Remove any lawn clippings with a rake., Rent a core aerator from a garden center. Move up and down the area, applying the aerator every step or two. Pass over the area from side to side, repeating the process. Pull up soil with the aerator until you have about ten holes for every square foot (1/10th a square meter)., You’ll need about three to five pounds (1.3-2.2 kg) of fescue seed per 1,000 square feet (93 meters). Spread the seed over the lawn, making sure to cover the areas that look thin. Overseeding the lawn is a plus and will lead to a thicker lawn., Raking the area will help get the seeds safely into the soil. A hand roller is also useful and will even out the soil without damaging the grass. In a pinch, an object such as a piece of carpeting or chain-link fence will also work. Drag it along the area to smooth the soil., As time passes, continue mowing the lawn as necessary to about three inches (8 cm) tall. Add nitrogen-rich fertilizer as needed to encourage growth. Also, keep the soil moist. Give the fescue up to an inch (2 cm) of water a week.	Wait for spring or fall. Test the soil’s pH. Kill weeds two weeks before planting. Till the area. Fertilize the area. Plant your seeds. Rake over the area to cover the seeds. Water the area. Spread mulch over the area. Mow the lawn. Aerate the soil. Sow new seed. Cover the seeds with soil. Treat the lawn as normal.
To make a layered hair bow, you will need three lengths of ribbon in complimentary colors or patterns - one piece of ribbon will be used to form your "main bow" so it should be wider than the other two. You will also need a glue gun, a threaded needle with a knot tied at the end, some scissors, a bottle of fray check and a barrette.  Take your widest piece of ribbon and make a loop in the center, similar to the loop you make when you're tying a shoelace.   This first loop will determine the size of the finished bow, so readjust it until you find a size you like. If you're using patterned ribbon, make sure the patterned side is facing out. Holding the first loop securely with your thumb and forefinger, make a second loop on the opposite side. You should see the shape of a bow coming together. Make a third and fourth loop, using the same technique. The fourth loop should come down across the center of the ribbon (from left to right) to form the second tail of the bow. At this point, take a second to readjust each of the loops, to make sure they are all the same size.  Holding the four loops securely at the center point with your thumb and forefinger, grab the threaded needle in your other hand and run in the the center of the bow, from back to front.   Make a number of stitches through the center of the bow to secure it. It doesn't matter if the stitches are messy, as you won't be able to see them when the bow is finished. Tie a knot in the thread at the back of the bow, then cut the thread with your scissors. If one of the tails on your bow is still attached to the spool of ribbon, cut it off. Keep the tails of the bow nice and long for now, you can cut them to your preferred length later.  Take the two smaller lengths of ribbon and use the same method to make two more bows.   Try to make these bows slightly smaller than the last one, as you will be layering them on top of one another.  Take your larger bow and sit the two smaller bows on top, making sure the centers are aligned.   Take your threaded needle and run it through the centers of all three bows, from back to front. Make several stitches to securely attach the bows. After several stitches, take the thread and wrap it around the center of the bow several times. Pull it tight in order to scrunch up the center of the bow. You may need to adjust the loops and the tails of the bow a little to make sure they are smoothed out and in the correct position. After you've wrapped the thread around the center of the bow several times, bring it around and tie a knot in the back to secure, then cut the thread.  Take a new piece of ribbon (it can be any of the three colors or patterns) and tie a simple knot. Readjust the ribbon to make sure the patterned side is facing out.   Align the knot over the center of the bow - this will cover up those messy stitches you made earlier! Flip the bow around and use your glue gun to place a dot of glue on the center of the back of the bow. Take your barrette, open it, and press the top half into the glue. Take one end of the knotted piece of ribbon and pass it through the open barrette. Press it down to stick it to the glue beneath. Cut off any excess. Place a dab of glue on the piece of ribbon you just passed through the barrette, then take the opposite end of the knotted piece of ribbon and stick it in place. Cut off any excess. Now the bow is securely attached to the barrette.  Flip the bow over so it is facing the right way around. Take your scissors and trim all six tails of the bow.   The easiest way to do this is to trim them at an angle, from the outside in. How long or short you cut the tails is a matter of personal preference. The final step is to take a bottle of fray check and run a small amount along the cut edge of each tail. This will prevent the ends from becoming frayed.	Gather your supplies. Make the loops. Secure with thread. Make a second and third bow. Put the bows together. Make the center knot and attach to the barrette. Trim the tails of the bow.

In the Disney version, Alice wears a short-sleeved light blue dress that falls mid-calf.   Thrift stores often carry inexpensive dresses that can be accessorized to look like Alice’s dress. Look through dress patterns at a fabric store to find an old-fashioned puffed sleeve dress. Some costume books may also include a pattern for a pinafore. Search online for a premade costume that includes a blue dress.; , In the Disney film, Alice wears a pinafore, which is a short apron that also covers the front of the bodice. A kitchen apron may be an affordable alternative to buying or making an authentic pinafore.Alice’s pinafore is white with a large bow at the back, which can help make your costume instantly recognizable  , Disney’s Alice wears white tights. Keep in mind the temperature for when you’re wearing your costume. If it will be outdoors in cool weather, choose the warmest tights you can to offset the flimsy dress.   Knee-high stockings might be more comfortable in warmer weather.  In the Disney film, Alice wears flat black shoes with a horizontal strap, a style of shoe commonly known as Mary Janes.  The headband is so often associated with this character that it is sometimes called an Alice band. The Disney film features a black headband with a bow.   If you do not have a headband, a black ribbon will work well.	Choose a dress. Pick a pinafore. Select stockings. Wear strappy flats. Choose a hairband.
Generally, a cajon is made of two different thicknesses of wood, thinner for the striking surface and slightly thicker for the rest of the instrument.         Use 1/8 inch plywood for the tapa. The tapa is the striking surface of the instrument, and you'll generally use a piece sized 13 inch by 19 inch for most cajons. For the other sides of the instrument, use 1/2 inch plywood.; , Prepare the body of the cajon by cutting the correct measurements to form the basic box. Make sure the cuts are very straight by clamping a metal ruler to the sheet of plywood and using a jigsaw or circular saw.          The top and bottom pieces should be 13 inch by 13 inch The single rear piece should be 13 inch by 18 inch The sides should be 12 1/2 inch by 18 inch  , Drill a hole towards the edge of the marked sound hole, and use that as a starting point to cut out the sound hole with a jigsaw.          Round and sand the edges to create an even and clean edge.  One of the distinctive things about the sound of the cajon is the snare-drum-like rattle made when hitting the tapa. This comes from attaching several strings of snares you can either make yourself, salvage from an old snare drum, or use new snares and attach to the inside of the drum.         A snare is basically a string or wire stretched to tension and outfitted with something that rattles. If you wanted to make your own, using old guitar strings, fishing line, or other wire would be perfectly appropriate for a homemade cajon. For rattles, try paperclips, sinkers, or other tiny metal salvaged materials that make a good rattling sound.  Start with the base and one of the side pieces, applying a liberal amount of wood glue. Next, glue the other side piece and the top to create the basic frame.          Have a helper steady the pieces as you add the glue and keep them as straight as possible, or cut guide pieces to keep inside the box and ensure straight angles.  Big carpentry clamps would be ideal, but luggage straps will do in a pinch. Strap ample pressure to the piece while the wood glue dries. Let it sit for several hours before adding the back, tapa, and snares.          Wipe off any excess glue with a wet cloth and read the instructions for the particular variety of wood glue you purchase for advice about pressure and drying time.  Depending on what you're using for snares, you can do this in a variety of different ways. Ideally, you might purchase some tuning pegs from the music store to be able to "tune" the snares periodically.          Stretch the snares diagonally from the top corners of the side that will be the tapa, roughly 3 inches from each corner on the top and on the side. Screw them in with wood screws, or attach them to tuning pegs for more control over the sound.  Apply the front and back piece as before and apply pressure for the same length of time. Orient the back piece so that the sound hole is at the base of the instrument, and the snares are at the top. You might also consider applying wood screws for added stability in your instrument. You're going to be sitting on it, so it's worth putting some extra strength into it.  Rubber or cork can also be used. It's ideal to have a somewhat cushioning surface to set the box on, since it's going to be holding up your weight as well. Putting plywood on the ground can scratch some surfaces.  Use sandpaper and take some time smoothing out the edges and the surfaces. Sand your cajon with progressively finer sanding paper, then finish to your liking.  Decorate the instrument with your own personal style. Finish it will wood stain for a professional and classy look, or hook it up with psychedelic Neptunes and polar bears for a wild hippy look. Have fun with it.	Get enough plywood to build your cajon. Cut out the required sheets of plywood. Trace a 12cm diameter hole on the rear piece. Fashion your snares. Glue the basic frame. Apply pressure. Attach the snares before gluing on the tapa. Glue on the tapa and the back piece. Cut out feet from leftover pieces of wood and screw them to the bottom. Round the top side corners to make it more comfortable to sit on. Give it some flair.
This works well with a wine bottle, olive oil bottles, large glass jugs, and any other glass container with a skinny neck.  Use a glass cutter to cut a small hole in the bottom of the bottle or jug.  Position your lips so that you're blowing horizontally right over the opening. Keep blowing until you get a clear note. This may take a while, so be patient and keep practicing.  Do this as you blow, and experiment with the different sounds it produces.	Get a glass jug or bottle. Bore a finger-sized hole in the bottom. Blow across the hole that is already in the top of the jug. Cover and uncover the hole on the bottom with your finger. Try tilting your head down and up to make the note sharp or flat.
In most situations, using your cruise control reduces fuel consumption by maintaining a constant speed.  The faster you move, the harder your engine has to work to push through the air. Speeding can reduce fuel efficiency by up to 33%. (Factors other than air resistance decrease fuel economy below about 60 mph (97 km/h), so fuel economy is not a reason to go slower, but fuel economy decreases rapidly above that speed).  Engines are most efficient with moderately high air flow (throttle) and at revolutions per minute (RPM)s up to their power peak (for small to mid sized engines this is generally somewhere between 4k to 5k RPM). In a manual transmission car, practice 'short shifting', or shifting to higher gears as soon as you reach your desired speed by skipping intermediate gears. For example, accelerate to 40 mph (64 km/h) using 1st gear and 2nd gear, then shift directly to 4th (skipping 3rd), or if your engine can maintain your speed, to 5th. (Be aware that if you have to floor the accelerator pedal in 5th to maintain your speed, you should be in 4th!)  , Braking wastes energy from fuel that you have already burned, and accelerating after braking consumes more fuel than driving at a constant speed. On city streets watch ahead and coast when you see a red light or traffic jam ahead.  Idling a vehicle wastes a significant amount of fuel. The best way to warm up a vehicle is to drive it slowly until it reaches proper operating temperature. However, in very cold weather it is still advisable to let the engine idle for about a minute or two before driving.  Some cars get better mileage at specific speeds, usually 50 mph (80 km/h). Your car's "sweet speed" is the minimum speed at which the car is running in its highest gear (watch for rpm drops as you accelerate to determine when your transmission is shifting into higher gears). For example, most Jeep Cherokees are best at 55 mph (89 km/h), and Toyota 4Runners are best at about 50 mph (80 km/h). Find your vehicle's "sweet speed" and pick your roads accordingly.  Overdrive is by default enabled on the "D" on most shifters. Several cars have buttons on the shifter which allow you to turn off the overdrive gear. Don't turn it off except in specific circumstances it may be needed such as for engine braking downhill or failure to proceed uphill smoothly in overdrive. Overdrive saves you gas mileage at higher speeds by using a higher gear in the transmission. For example, for every ¾ of a turn of the engine going into the transmission, the output of the trans is one.  Look for a spot in the empty half of the parking lot. Many people spend significant time idling and creeping, waiting for a "close spot" to open up.  Don't stick to the bumper of the car directly in front of you. You will brake more and accelerate more to keep that unnecessary and dangerously narrow gap. Relax. Hang back a bit. This also gives you a lot more room to play with when you are timing lights. When the driver ahead of you slams on his brakes, you can coast down and see if the light quick-changes green again (some do). You might even coast by his car as the light turns green and he has to accelerate from a dead stop.  If your route will allow it, try to make as few left turns as possible on the way to your destination (or right turns in countries with left-hand traffic). Stopping and waiting at an intersection to make a turn across the oncoming lane lets the engine run idle, which wastes gas, as does accelerating once again to make the turn.	Use cruise control. Slow down. Accelerate smoothly with moderate throttle. Avoid braking wherever possible. Avoid excessive idling. Find your car's "sweet speed". Make sure you enable overdrive if your car has an automatic transmission with overdrive, except when towing very heavy trailers. Don't circle in a parking lot, and keep well away from the store fronts. Maintain a safe following distance. Avoid turning across oncoming traffic.
Something will pop up.  There are four kinds of drinks to choose from. Then, something else will show., For example, if you aren't making a banana-flavored smoothie, avoid catching bananas. Don't catch that in your cup, or your juice will go down. Now, once you have caught a few strawberries or the other flavors, the color in your cup will go up (if you got strawberry it would be a red circle)., Once you have filled your cup up with the correct fruit, the machine will tell you that you've won. After the message flashes a bit, a drink will pop up by your animal. You can now drink it.	Click on the remote control above the juice hut. Pick which flavor you would like. Try to catch all of your fruit in the gray cup. Finished.
Once you’ve been pre-approved by the lender, you'll know what you can spend. But there's no reason to share that information with the dealer. If you walk in saying you've been pre-approved for $15,000, you'll probably end up spending $15,000. Instead, try and do all the negotiation you can beforehand.   If you think you’ll be tempted to show it to the salesmen, don’t come to the dealer with your pre-approval paperwork at all.  If you are buying a car from the dealer, they may offer you financing. This financing usually has higher interest rates, but the dealership can offer you other incentives, such as rebates or no-interest periods, that may bring down the cost overall. Talk to the dealer, and get a quote for financing to see if it is right for you.  Some dealerships will advertise that they finance people with no or bad credit. Typically these dealerships charge extremely high interest rates. It is better to see if a bank, credit union, or reputable dealer will give you a loan first., Before you buy a used car, ask the dealer if you can have a mechanic examine the car to make sure that there are no problems. Always get your own mechanic to perform this service. They should check out the car’s brakes, electrical system, compression, transmission, and other parts to prevent you from buying a defective car., Once you buy the car, make sure that you have the title transferred into your name. You should doublecheck that the VIN on the title is the same as it is on the car. The odometer on the car should also be the same or higher than it is listed on the title. Go through all of the proper paper work, and submit it to your state DMV.  Be sure to get a new license plate for the car registered in your state of residence.  You must have insurance on your new car. Contact a few insurance companies to find the best rate. If you had insurance on your old car, contact your insurance agency and tell them that you have bought a new car, so that they can adjust your insurance. This will ensure that your insurance will cover the new car.	Negotiate price with the seller. Consider dealer financing if available. Ask for a mechanic inspection before closing. Complete the purchase. Buy the required insurance.
English ivy prefers partial sun or filtered shade, but it will grow in full shade. If you plant ivy in an area that is not shaded during the heat of the day, provide the plant with a shade screen for the first 4 to 6 months. Ivy is an invasive plant, so pick an area where it has plenty of room to grow and will not interfere with other plants. Be absolutely certain you want to plant it, as it's invasive, considered a weed in many areas and not allowed in some. See Warnings below.; , English ivy grows best in a pH of around 7.  Add hydrated lime to raise the alkalinity, or sulfur to raise the acidity. Follow package directions when adjusting your soil pH, and then test the soil again to check the new pH level.  English ivy grow best in well-drained, fertile soil.  The hole should be slightly wider than the plant's root base.  This stimulates the growth of the plant and its roots.  Fill in the hole with soil. , Mulch helps plants retain moisture and prevents weeds from growing.	Choose the right spot to plant English ivy. Check the pH level of the soil before planting. Adjust the pH level of your soil if needed. Till the soil to a depth of 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) and amend it will organic compost if needed. Dig a hole 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) deep. Pinch off the bottom few leaves on the plant. Put the roots of the plant into the hole, with the base of the stem at ground level. Water the ivy well after planting to help it get established.  , Spread 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of mulch around the plant.
Hot water makes bleach more effective, though it can also cause chlorine bleach to release more chlorine fumes. So only use hot water with bleach in the washing machine, where the fumes will be contained., If your washer has a special bleach dispenser, you can put everything in at once. Pour detergent into the drum or its own dispenser, place laundry in the drum, and pour bleach into its dispenser. Follow the instructions on your machine regarding amounts, but typically you can use ½ cup (120 mL) of bleach for a full-sized load. Turn on the washer and let it run normally., Add however much detergent you need for the size of the load you’re doing and turn on the water. Let the water agitate the detergent for 5 minutes., Follow the directions on your machine for how and when to add bleach. But if you’re unsure, it’s best to wait 5 minutes to add the bleach. Detergents have special enzymes that can be deactivated by bleach if the two liquids are mixed together. Waiting 5 minutes allows the enzymes to dissolve in the water first.Use about ½ cup (120 mL) of bleach for a full-sized load. If there are any items with color in this load, use only non-chlorine bleach.  Once the water has detergent and bleach fully mixed in, add the items you want to wash. Waiting to add them until now helps you dilute the bleach first so that none of your garments get heavy doses of bleach., When the cycle is done, your clothes should be clean and stain-free. You may need to repeat this process for items with really tough stains.	Set your washer to the highest heat possible. Add detergent and bleach if your machine has a bleach dispenser. Add water first if your machine doesn’t have a bleach dispenser. Add bleach 5 minutes into the cycle. Add the clothing to the washer. Allow the washer to run normally.

Moisture and extreme temperatures can damage your coins. Keep them in a temperature controlled environment, which means not in the basement or attic.Also avoid bathrooms and other sources of humidity., Certain substances interact poorly with silver over extended periods of time. This includes paper, aluminum foil, and plastics with PVC. Plastics can be a great storage medium for silver, but you should verify that they aren’t PVC plastics, which are generally softer plastics., There are many products marketed for coin storage, but some like coin folders, are designed more to make coins easy to view than for storing extremely valuable mints. Good storage devices include hard plastic storage cases and glass or plastic coin tubes.Coin folders can be problematic because they expose your coins to air. However, if you have the original, airtight packaging, you can keep the coin in the packaging and place it in the folder. Make sure that the flaps are made of mylar, rather than soft plastic with PVC. Many varieties of coin containers may be purchased online. Silver is susceptible to tarnish from sulfur compounds and nitrates. These are chemical compounds that exist in the air as a result of pollution.	Find a location that is cool and dry. Keep coins away from abrasive substances. Purchase an airtight container designed for valuable coins.
For the most part, the stitches are probably already known to you. Some of the important ones are:    Backstitch: This is a reinforcing stitch made at the beginning and end of a seam to keep stitches in place.  Basting: These are the large running stitches that you use to tack together fabric pieces or layers temporarily. This gets removed once the permanent stitching is in place.  Seam: This refers to the line of stitches that forms when you sew together two pieces of fabric. Seam allowance: This refers to the distance or space between the seam and the cut edge of the fabric. Most quilts will have a standard seam allowance of a quarter inch.; , These are useful terms to learn early:   Backing: This is the base or bottom layer of each quilt. Batting: This forms the middle layer of the quilt. It's the part that provides the insulation (warmth) and the thickness of the quilt. Quilt top: This is the top layer of the quilt. This is where all the decorative elements of the quilt are shown. It sits over the batting and the backing.  Many patterns will refer to these terms.   Binding: This is the fabric strip that is used to enclose raw edges of a quilt. The edges can also be finished off using binding, depending on the style of the quilt being made. Border: The border is formed by strips of fabric in order to frame the quilt top. Fat quarter: This refers to a pre-cut square of quilt fabric that can be themed in colors, patterns, styles, etc. Quilt blocks: This refers to the sections that are sewn together to form the quilt top. Sashing: The sashing means the strips of fabric that separate the individual blocks in a quilt top. Selvages: This refers to the two tightly woven edges of fabric that go lengthwise along the quilt. Setting squares: These are the squares of pieced fabric that are placed between pieced blocks on the quilt top. Strip set: The strip set consists of two or more strips of fabric sewn together along the long edges, following which they are cut apart across the width of the sewn strips. This turns them into smaller pieces or "units". Units: Units are the fabric pieces that have been sewn together to form a sub-group. Units can form blocks on the quilt or might be used in other ways as directed by the pattern.  These are handy terms, so that your quilt can sit correctly and be pieced together!   Bias: This refers to the grain of fabric either crosswise or lengthwise. True bias is 45º. Chain piecing: This method is used on a sewing machine. It involves joining pairs or pieces one after another by feeding them through the sewing machine without cutting the thread between the pairs. Grain: This refers to the direction in which the threads sit in woven fabric. Crosswise grain means the threads run from selvage to selvage, while lengthwise grain means the threads running parallel to the selvage. Piecing: This is the act of sewing together the pieces of the quilt top in order to form a quilt block or the whole design of the quilt. Pin basting: This is the method for pinning together the quilt prior to machine stitching it. Always use pins that cannot rust, especially if you're not working on the quilt that frequently or you live somewhere with high humidity. Quilting lines: These are the designs drawn directly on the fabric. A suitable fabric marker is used (perhaps even an invisible marker that fades) and you can follow these as a guidance as you quilt. Set or setting: These terms refer to the arrangement of quilt blocks as they're sewn together to form the top of the quilt. Straight grain: This is the crosswise or lengthwise grain of fabric. Be aware that the least give occurs on the lengthwise grain. Triangle square: This refers to two right triangles joined on their long sides. Doing so forms a square with a diagonal seam.  At first it can take some time to remember the meanings of the principal terms as you work through a pattern. It can be helpful to keep a dedicated notebook to remind yourself what each term means until it becomes habit for you.  There are many specific terms for the range of quilt styles and techniques. The best way to learn all the relevant terms is to read widely in the area of quilting (while enjoying the photos of completed quilts) and you'll find that it won't take long to pick up all the relevant terms.	Learn the stitches used. Learn the terms for the layers of the quilt. Learn the terms used for the fabric pieces that are added to a quilt. Learn the terms related to joining the quilt together. Keep a notebook with the terms written down. Read quilting sites and magazines to learn more.
Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions when using any electrical appliances or equipment. Do not use the products in ways that are not recommended by the manufacturer.You should also never use defective appliances in your home or office. Get them inspected by the manufacturer or by a qualified electrician.  You should try to get into the habit of disconnecting small appliances like electric kettles, toasters, and hair dryers, once you are done using them. This way, you save electricity and you lower the risk of an electrical fire due to these appliances.You should also make sure you unplug all appliances before you clean them. You do not want water to come into contact with the appliances while they are plugged in.  You should only use light bulbs that match the wattage of the fixture. Do not use light bulbs that have a higher wattage than recommended on the light fixture. This is an electrical hazard.Check that the light bulbs are screwed in properly. Improperly secured light bulbs can lead to overheating, which can then lead to an electrical fire.  Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), can help to prevent electrical fires by shutting down automatically if a circuit is overloaded or at risk. Your home or office may already have GFCIs installed in the electrical outlets. There will be a small black "test" button and a small red "reset" button on the outlets. You can then use these buttons to reset your electrical current if there is a power overloadThe most common type of GFCI is the "receptacle-type" GFCI, which can be installed in your electrical wall outlets by a qualified electrician.You should have GFCIs installed throughout your home, such as in your kitchen, your bathrooms, your laundry room, your workshop, your basement, and your garage. There are also temporary, portable GFCIs available for construction sites and outdoor areas where you are using electric tools or yard equipment like lawn mowers or trimmers. GFCIs in your home or office should be tested on a monthly basis to ensure they are functioning properly. They should be tested by a qualified electrician.	Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Disconnect small appliances when not in use. Make sure you use the right light bulbs in fixtures. Make sure there are Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters in your outlets.
It is usually at the beginning of the pattern, along with the type of yarn and size of knitting needle to use.; , For example, a teddy bear will turn out fine even if a bit bigger or smaller than the pattern instructions, while gloves need to be sized exactly so they fit the wearer.  For a project with leeway, a 4-inch (10-cm) swatch can suffice, but otherwise, you want a sample of 6 to 8 inches (15-20 cm).  Use stockinette stitch (knit one row, purl next row) for measuring knit gauge, unless the pattern's listed gauge specifically says to work the sample in another pattern, such as a seed stitch.   When making a 4-inch (10-cm) swatch, use stockinette or the listed stitch for making the entire sample. (If no stitch is listed, the listed gauge refers to stockinette stitch.) The end result will be an approximation, because stitch tension functions differently on edges than in the midst of a fabric. When making a swatch of 6 to 8 inches(15-20 cm), work in the garter stitch for the first several rows until you have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) as border. After that, begin and end each row with an inch (2.5 cm) of garter stitch. In the middle, use stockinette stitch or the pattern being used by the gauge, until you're about 1 inch (2.5 cm) short of making a square. Finish that last inch (2.5 cm) in garter stitch. The garter stitch border will mimic how putting the stitches within the full project will affect the tension, while giving you easy points to start and end your measuring and counting.  Set a hard ruler across your swatch to count your stitches per 4 inches (10 cm).   To get the most accurate gauge measurement, wash and dry your sample before you measure your knit gauge. The horizontal measurement is your stitches per inch. The vertical measurement is your rows per inch. , If it's more than 1 stitch difference, then you probably need a thicker yarn.  If it's more than 1 stitch fewer, then you probably need a thinner yarn.	Find the gauge listed on the pattern. Consider your project, assessing whether the measurements need to be precise, or if the item size can vary and still be usable. Determine what size sample swatch you will use. Knit your sample swatch. Lay your sample flat and skip the edges of the sample swatch. Compare your sample gauge to the pattern's gauge measurement.  , If you have about 1 stitch more per inch (2.5 cm) than the pattern, try again with a larger needle. If you have about 1 stitch fewer per inch (2.5 cm) than the pattern, try again with a smaller needle. Begin your project with the yarn and needles that matched the pattern gauge.
Don't stay outdoors during a dust storm intentionally. If hear a dust storm warning don't ignore it. If you have any way to get inside a building, do it quickly.Well-sealed buildings are ideal but any structures that will withstand the storm and give you some protection are best.  If you cannot get inside a building or a car, find a location that is relatively protected from the storm. This could be against the side of a building or under a piece of vegetation, whatever you can find. Just be sure to stay off roads and out of areas that may be more dangerous than helpful.   Avoid laying in ditches or dry riverbeds for protection. Dust storms are often followed by thunderstorms, so you protected area may quickly become a spot for flash flooding., Most importantly, find something to protect your breathing. If you cannot get inside, find something to breathe through before the storm hits. Ideally this would be a particulate filter mask but any dust mask or thick piece of clothing will suffice.   Cloth will not keep all particulates out of your respiratory system but it is better than nothing. It will help to keep large particulates out and will help you get the oxygen you need to breathe and survive. Although you shouldn't, if you are determined to go outside in a severe dust storm, then you should wear a particulate filter mask and airtight goggles to protect your mouth, nose, and eyes. This will help to assure that you do not inhale the dust, which is dangerous for your health and can cause serious breathing problems and even death., Before the storm actually hits, or as soon as possible, you should cover up your face. This will allow you to keep breathing and to avoid damage to your eyes.In addition, if you have a hat or piece of clothing that you can cover your ears with, do that. Dust from a dust storm can easily get in your ears and clog them. However, don't protect your ears over protecting your eyes, nose, and mouth.	Get inside if you can. Take shelter. Find protective materials. Cover your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Look for a hollowed shell that is big enough to house a succulent plant and some dirt. Succulent plants don’t require as much water as other indoor houseplants and can thrive in a smaller habitat like the inside of a seashell.Look for larger clamshells or other seashells that are of a suitable size. Scour beaches and try to find a hallowed shell.  There are also online stores that sell hallowed seashells.You can also find man-made synthetic seashells online.  You can use soil that you’ve found in the yard or fertilizer. Succulents thrive in loose soil that has good drainage. When choosing a soil choose things like coarse sand or perlite with potting soil to create good drainage.Make sure to fill your shell outside or over a sink so that you don’t make a mess.  You can also purchase succulent specific soils at most home and gardening stores.  Use your finger, or a chopstick to create a hole in the soil. Place your succulent into the holes that you make. Place more holes for more succulents until you have a full arrangement within your planter. Once your plants are in the holes, you can put more soil to fill the remainder of the holes and hold your plants in place.When placing your holes, make sure to do so strategically so that your arrangement is aesthetically pleasing to you.  While this step is optional, decorating your planter with paint or small gems is a good way to enhance its look and make it more unique. One method of painting your shell is to use watercolor paint. Mix colors together to create a tie dye seashell planter.Another method of painting is to use a metallic spray paint and spray the shells to give them a shiny, metallic look.Lastly, you can hot glue small gems or stones onto the surface of the shell to give it a more glamorous feeling., Because these planters are more delicate and are likely to get destroyed if placed outside, it’s probably a good idea to keep them inside your house. Find a place, like a window that leads to outside, where the succulents can get enough sunlight.  Allow the soil to dry out before watering your seashell planters., Find the small holes that are usually found in many shells and thread a fishing line through them in order to hang them. If there are no holes in your shells, you can drill small pilot holes using an electric drill.Hang the planters in areas that won’t obstruct people’s walking paths.  Good locations to hang your miniature planters include the porch or a shed.	Find a suitable seashell. Fill your shell ¾ of the way with soil. Plant your succulent into the soil. Decorate your seashell planter. Place your miniature seashell planters on a shelf or windowsill. Hang your seashell planters with fishing line.
Many scrunchies, especially those popular in the '90's, were famously thick and had a lot of excess fabric bunched around the elastic band. It is no longer fashionable to have a scrunchie dominate your look. Therefore, look for thinner scrunchies without a lot of excess bulk due to fabric. This makes for a more mature, classy look.However, a thick scrunchie is sometimes necessary if you're doing something like a bun that requires extra support.; , Modern scrunchies now come in a variety of patterns and styles. Sites like Etsy sell scrunchies in a variety of prints and patterns.Select a scrunchie with a pattern that works for your particular outfit.   For example, you can try a scrunchie to match your outfit. Try pairing a checkerboard dress with a checkerboard scrunchie.  Scrunchies often come in bright, noticeable colors. You should opt for a scrunchie with a color that matches or compliments your outfit. When wearing purple, for example, go for a purple scrunchie or one in a complimentary color such as yellow.  A scrunchie can be used at the end of a long braid in place of a hair tie. Braid your hair together in the back. You can either tie it with a scrunchie or a tie it with a hair tie and then place a scrunchie over it.Thicker hair may need to be tied with a tighter hair tie before you put in the scrunchie.   When using a scrunchie with a braid, the scrunchie will become the primary focus of your hairstyle. If you want to highlight a scrunchie with an attractive color or pattern, a braid is a great way to do so.  A thick bun on the top of your head can be held in place with a scrunchie. This provides a slight '90s throwback appeal. It also puts the scrunchie front and center. This can work great if you're matching colored scrunchies with your clothing., Part your hair to the side and then gather it together near the nape of your neck. Keep it loose enough that your top ears are covered by your hair. Loop the scrunchie around your hair slightly lower than the nape of your neck. This will make a fun, casual ponytail. Your scrunchie will look great with a more casual look.If you want your ponytail a little loser, shake your head back and forth a little after putting your scrunchie.  A scrunchie can prevent the awkward dent often found in the middle of a high ponytail. To make a high ponytail with a scrunchie, flip your hair over the front of your head. Brush your hair upward to remove lumps. Then, secure your hair together at the top of your head with a scrunchie., A bubble ponytail looks cute and a little quirky when secured with scrunchies. It's simple to do. Make a low ponytail. Then, add two more scrunchies to the ponytail. Keep all the scrunchies at equal distance from one another.If you want a very quirky look, use scrunchies in different patterns or colors.  Flashy scrunchies are no longer considered fashionable. Things like glitter and metallic materials are no longer popular for a scrunchie look. Avoid scrunchies with a lot of flash or scrunchies made from unusual materials, such as very fuzzy scrunchies., Scrunchies were often used as eye-catching accessories. They tended to be bright and flashy and attracted a lot of attention.Now, they should generally be blended into your main look. Pick scrunchies that go with your outfit rather than working against it. Similar colors and patterns can help your scrunchie blend into your attire.   For example, if you're wearing a checkerboard dress, select a matching checkerboard scrunchie.  Some scrunchies come in extremely gaudy shades. While very bright colored or neon scrunchies were popular in the '90s, they are no longer considered in style. Opt for scrunchies in more played down colors.	Pick a thinner scrunchie for a modern look. Experiment with prints and patterns. Select a color that matches your outfit and style. Secure a braid with a scrunchie. Hold up a bun with a thick scrunchie. Tie a loose, low ponytail with a scrunchie. Try a high ponytail. Do a bubble ponytail. Avoid distracting materials. Blend your scrunchie into your look. Avoid neon shades.
A kit should contain the poly (polyester) resin, hardener (catalyst), and cloth for structural strength. You can buy kits from home centers, department stores, or auto parts stores in various sizes depending on your project.   What exactly is fiberglass? Fiberglass starts off as a liquid. This liquid is then extruded through tiny little holes, which turn it into thin strands of threads. These threads are coated with a chemical solution and bundled together to form rovings, or long bundles of fibre. Add a bit of resin and you have strong, durable, flexible fiberglass.; , If you are making fiberglass for project, like a simple box, bowl, or other shape, you probably want to assemble a "mold" or "form" to make sure that your fiberglass, which starts off in liquid form, adheres to the right shape. If you find yourself doing a fiberglass repair on a boat or car, for example, consider taping off the repair site and apply the resinous fiberglass coating directly to the repair site.  Blocks of styrofoam or polystyrene foam work best for objects that have curves or other non-linear forms. Simply cut or shave the foam into your desired shape, such as a fountain bottom, bird bath, or dome. Cover the material with wax paper, and use wax to seal and attach all joints, as well as for smoothing rough seams.  These stiffer materials are best for large projects like dog houses or even boats. For these molds, cover the entire surface either with wax paper, or a good, even coat of paraffin wax. Carnauba wax can also be used as a substitute for paraffin wax.  The material will become very flexible when the resin is applied, so don't worry if you cannot get it to conform to an exact shape while it is dry.  A large can or metal bowl will work, but it should be of a disposable nature. Resin can be mixed in a clean plastic container, but because it generates heat when it sets, extreme care should be taken if you use one.  In a kit, you will have a pre-measured "can" or bucket of resin, and a pre-measured "tube" (like a glue tube) of hardener, so you can safely use an equal proportion of each material, i.e., half your hardener and half your resin, or some other proportion. , The mat (or cloth) will seem to melt into the resin as you spread it, and you can use the brush and additional coats of resin to build up the layer of fiberglass to a thickness of up to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).   As you spread the resin over the fiberglass mat, make sure to apply it over corners and weak spots with the same coverage that you would over flat, easy-to-reach surfaces. If you fail to get good coverage in corners, for example, your fiberglass will eventually develop weaknesses in those corners.  Continue working until you have used all of your material.  Acetone is great for cleaning up fiberglass because it's strong and evaporates quickly. Just be sure not to soak any portion of the fiberglass in acetone, and keep acetone away from any caulking, plastic, or rubber., Fiberglass is usually applied in layers until it is thick enough to give the required strength you desire to achieve. Depending on your project (leaving room for flexibility of course), try at least 3 layers, but no more than 10.If possible, try laying down the fiberglass mat with the fibers oriented in different directions with each new layer. Fiberglass is strong across its axis but weak along its axis; if you can orient the strand mat so that its weak points are distributed along various axes instead of a single axis, you'll end up with much stronger fiberglass. Sand in between steps to eliminate rough spots where mat or cloth may project through the resin.  Then, paint with a polyurethane or alkyd enamel, if desired.  If you have covered your form or mold with wax paper or paraffin wax, you should be able to peel the form from inside the shape, or peel the shape off of the form. The fiberglass will not stick to the wax.	Purchase a "fiberglass kit.", Think of a mold for your fiberglass. Use foam or pliable materials for molds with organic shapes. Use cardboard, plywood, MDF, or other stiff materials for molds with linear or geometric shapes. Prepare the fiberglass mat or cloth in sheets cut to suitable sizes to cover your form, allowing for plenty of overlap where you need to join it at corners or sharp curves. Measure an appropriate amount of resin in a metal container. Add the hardener, according to package instructions. Stir this material thoroughly, being careful to stir the bottom and sides, and not just the middle of the container, using a paint stick.  , Lay mat on or in your form, and spread the resin mixture over it with a disposable paint brush. Work the mat and resin completely over your form until it is covered uniformly. Clean up any tools or spills with a solvent containing acetone before the material hardens. Repeat the steps of applying mat and resin until the finished project is as thick as you want it. Finish your project by coating with gel coat or a smooth coat of resin. Remove your fiberglass from the form.

There are twelve major scales that you can practice, which will help strengthen the foundation of your piano skills. Becoming familiar with the scales' notations will help you be able to play them accurately. You can search them on the Internet and print them out to use as a reference as you play. A good scale to start with would be the C Major scale, which consists of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.   Remember to not miss any sharps or flats. Although the C Major scale has neither sharps nor flats, other scales have them. An example would be the G Major scale, which contains the notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.  Keep in mind that a sharp is a semitone above and a flat is a semitone below.  ; , The height and distance from the piano should feel comfortable. When sitting on it, you should only take up about half of the seat. Position yourself so that you are close enough to reach the keys but not near enough that your elbows bend. Make sure that your feet can reach the pedals and press down on them when necessary.  Developing a good posture helps you play naturally. Your body will be relaxed enough to avoid strain, and you'll be able to play for long periods of time without growing weary. When you play the piano, keep your back straight, and make sure your head is held high and facing forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed so that you can play naturally. You should also keep your arms and wrists lifted above the keys. Place your legs so that your knees are at a 90 to a 120-degree angle, and position your feet so that they are resting on or in front of the pedals.  In order to play well, you should keep your hands arched and fingers curled on the keys, as if you're holding a baseball. This reduces the chances of cramping or weariness during your practice sessions. You should also keep a straight wrist as this prevents arthritis and carpal tunnel. In the beginning, you can tape a pencil to your wrist to keep it from bending. The goal is to move your fingers, not your wrist.   If your wrists are still bending, sit a little further away from the piano. Keep your nails cut short. This stops them from clicking against the keys, and you'll be able to play better. You want your fingertips to touch the keys, not your nails.  In order to make sure that you properly learn them, start to slow and gradually increase the speed. You will be able to hear each note better and give yourself time to memorize the scale. Playing quickly will only cause the scales to sound sloppy. If you want, you can invest in a metronome, which will teach you to keep the tempo. When you first begin, set the count to 85 beats per minute. Work your way up by increasing the speed.   You can set the count slower if you're having difficulties.  There are specific orders to follow in scales. Using the correct fingering will help you play the scales in the most natural and effective manner possible. In the future, you'll also be able to play other songs with flowing movement. You can look up the fingerings of different scales online and print them out if necessary. When playing, be sure to bend your fingers at their joint and hold up your wrist.  When you first learn the scales, practice them using one hand before moving onto the next. Then, you can play them together. If you notice that your right hand is better than your left, practice more often with your left hand to ensure that you sharpen its skills (and vice-versa). Make sure that you practice with both hands; otherwise, one might lose its skills, and you'll have to train it again.  Repetition is key, as it helps drive the scale into your memory. Be sure to play until it sounds accurate, not sloppy. Do your best to connect all the notes for a smooth sound - never use staccato notes. As you become more familiar with the scale and keys, begin to look straight ahead as you play. You may be tempted to look down at your hands to make sure that you're hitting the right notes. However, the less you watch your fingers, the more secure you become in your playing.  Once you become familiar with one scale, move onto others to continue expanding your skills. Some may take a longer time to learn, as they might contain more flats and sharps than others. However, continue persevering. Don't hesitate to ask for help or look up tutorials and advice on the Internet. Continue practicing old scales to ensure that you don't forget them.	Learn the major scales' notations. Adjust the bench. Sit properly at the piano. Correctly position your hand. Slowly play the scale. Use the correct fingering. Play with one hand at a time. Practice. Broaden your practice sessions to other scales.
Not all healthy ingredients are expensive. In fact, many healthy ingredients are cheap. Take each category of food you need to buy, and figure out options in each one.  For instance, in whole grains, you can try oatmeal, brown rice, bulgur, popcorn, and whole-wheat bread and pasta. For vegetables, pick ones like cabbage, leafy greens (like mustard greens, kale, or even broccoli), squash, carrots, and celery. In fruit, go for cheaper options, such as oranges, apples, and bananas. In the dairy section, reach for milk and plain yogurt in large containers., Keep in mind that you probably need less protein than you think in your diet. Making your proteins last across several meals will help both your budget and your diet. For instance, if you make a chicken one night, use the leftovers the next night to make a chicken soup. The night after that, use some of the chicken in tacos.Adult women under 30 only need 5 1/2 ounce-equivalents each day, while women over 30 only need 5 ounce-equivalents. Adult men under 30 need 6 1/2, while if you're 30 to 50, you need 6 ounce-equivalents and 5 1/2 if you're over 50. An "ounce-equivalent" is one ounce (28 grams) of meat (3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards)., While you don't need to completely cut animal protein out of your diet, opting for plant-based protein sometimes can help cut costs. Try focusing meals around these vegetarian options, such as having beans and rice one night instead of chili.Some vegetarian equivalents to an ounce of meat include an egg, 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of beans, peas, or lentils, 1/2 an ounce (14 grams) of nuts or seeds, a tablespoon (15 milliliters) of peanut butter, or 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of hummus., While you need to compare prices on foods, you should also compare labels for items you're buying, particularly if you're buying prepacked food of any kind. For instance, if you must have a box of macaroni and cheese, it's best to pick the healthiest one you can find.Look for foods low in sugar and sodium. You should be eating about 2,300 milligrams (1 teaspoon) of salt per day. Also, check for lower trans and saturated fat. Even the healthier fats should only be 20 to 30 percent of what you eat. Keep serving sizes to 400 calories or less. Also, check to see how many vitamins and minerals the food has.	Choose cheaper ingredients. Make your proteins last longer. Go vegetarian. Read labels.

The particular government entity that mandates requirements for obtaining a pilot's license may also have a school locator that can help you begin the selection process. The United States agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, has such a tool. Different licenses are available depending on the type of aircraft you wish to fly and whether you will fly professionally or recreationally. A PPL is the designation for a private pilot's license according to the Joint Aviation Authority, or JAA, which governs flight schools in European countries. According to the JAA, the "JAA-FCL 1" is the general term for rules regarding an aeroplane license; "JAA-FCL 2," specifies the criteria for a helicopter license. Similarly, the FAA also has licenses for private and recreational pilots. The school that you select must have a flight instructor with the knowledge and certifications to train you for the appropriate license. For example, in order to become an air transport pilot, the school should have an instructor with such a license.; , In some countries, a doctor must perform the examination at specific facilities.   The JAA certifies authorized medical examiners (AMEs) to provide assessments. AMEs are located throughout the JAA member-states, and are often simply physicians in hospitals and clinics. The CAA, or Civil Aviation Authority, in Great Britain mandates that commercial pilots undergo an initial medical examination at the United Kingdom CAA Aeromedical Centre (AMC) at Gatwick airport in West Sussex. The examination takes around half a day to complete. The FAA requires you to see an Aviation Medical Examiner, or AME. You can find an AME in your area by visiting the FAA's website.  There are several variables that determine your total tuition cost.   While the FAA requires a minimum of 40 hours of flight time to become a private pilot, the number of hours that it takes you may vary by state. However, many training facilities note that 55 hours of flying is more realistic. Many schools suggest that students take at least two classes a week, which correlates to finishing in 6 months. Unlike paying for a semester of tuition in a lump sum at a traditional university, you can pay for lessons as you take them. Some schools may offer discounts if you pay for several classes at a time, and some schools offer financing.	Select a qualified flight school with certified flight instructors. Obtain a certificate from a doctor that proves you are fit to fly. Pay the flight school's tuition.
Sprinkle baking soda onto a damp cloth or sponge. Wipe the surface of your whitewall tires in small, circular motions. Rinse the tires clean.Rinse the cloth and reapply baking soda every few minutes until you're satisfied with the results.  To whiten your tires, try eraser cleaning pads (like Mr. Clean Magic Eraser pads). Wet both the pad and your tires and wipe the tires down in small, circular motions. For best results, rinse or replace the pads between tires., If tires remain yellowed after persistent cleaning, sand the top layer of the white part with fine, dry sand paper. Sand away the yellowed layer slowly and gently until a bright white layer emerges underneath. Rinse tires clean with the hose.	Use baking soda. Try eraser cleaning pads. Use sand paper to remove stubborn yellowing.
To replace a light socket in the ceiling, you'll need some basic electrician's tools to complete the job safely. It's good to have:   A razor, to cut around fixture if there’s paint Lineman’s pliers Screwdriver Non-contact voltage tester Wire strippers Extra wire nuts; , Any time you're working with electricity, you need to locate the breaker that corresponds to that particular fixture and shut it off. You can test the power by flipping the light switch and making sure that it doesn't turn on. It's also a good idea to use a non-contact voltage tester to make sure the fixture isn't getting power.  Decorative fixtures like globes will need to be removed first, gently unscrewing or unfastening the connections and putting the piece aside. You might need to use a screwdriver, but most fixtures will probably just use thumbscrews that you can remove by hand. Remove the lightbulb or bulbs, as well to expose the socket itself for examination.  You need to figure out how the fixture is attached to the ceiling, before you go unscrewing it. Most fixtures are attached in one of two ways. The first method involves simple screws that go through the fixture into the junction box in the ceiling. The second involves a threaded post that extends through the fixture from behind and attaches with a decorative cap nut, usually a small knob in the center of the fixture.  There are typically two or three screws holding the fixture itself to the bracket. Lower the fixture down, exposing the wire connections. Once the fixture is down, use your hands or pliers to undo the wire nuts.   Wire nuts are the plastic cone-looking pieces covering the ends of where the wires come together, connecting the black and white wires coming from the fixture to the wires coming from the ceiling. There might also be a ground wire from the fixture attached to the metal of the junction box in the ceiling by a screw.  The junction box is a round, square or octagonal box, usually made of plastic, in the ceiling under where the fixture used to be. Normally there will be white and black wires.  Not all fixtures are a simple set of wires coming into the box, especially in large houses. Some fixtures are wired in parallel with others, making the tangle somewhat confusing. The wires from the fixture will the connected to wires of the same color coming from the ceiling. In some countries, different color codes apply to wires, especially in older installations.  If they are not, carefully remove the rubber covering from the 1/2" of the ends of the wires using wire strippers.   Some of the wires may be loose, or you may need to use pliers to untwist them. If ends of wires are damaged or bent, you may need to clip them and strip them again.  The wiring from the fixture should be exposed and ready to be attached. It's sometimes helpful to set the new fixture on something to allow you to work on it without it hanging down, if possible, like the top of a ladder.   The length of the exposed wire should match the manufacturer’s recommendation for the wire nuts, usually around 3/8ths to ½ in of exposed wire.  The wires should be reattached in the same places as the old fixture, usually white to white, black to black, and ground (bare copper) to the metal junction box. Neutral wire–usually white–should be attached to neutral wire. Twist the wires two or three times together clockwise, or the same direction you turn the wire nuts.   You can use either the old wire nuts or the new ones provided with the fixture. To use the wire nut, place the stripped ends of each wire next to each other, with their points facing the same direction. Then place the wire nut over the ends and twist clockwise until the wires are secured inside the wire nut.  If there is, either remove the nut, trim the exposed end, and replace the nut, or cover with electrician's tape. Give a quick tug on each wire to make sure they’re not going to come loose.  Once all connections are made, gently tuck them back into the box as you’re lifting the fixture up. You don’t want to overstuff. Once the majority of your wires are in the box, you can loosely screw in the fixture to the bracket. Once it’s installed but not fully tightened, make sure you won’t pinch any wires and tighten the fixture.  Once your fixture is installed to the bracket, you’ll install the bulb following manufacturer’s recommendations about the wattage. Then you can flip on the circuit and check your work.   If it doesn’t turn on, most likely culprit is a loose connection. Check to make sure that the wires didn’t come loose while you were tucking them into the box. Also, check that bulb is the proper type or that another switch isn’t interfering with anything.	Assemble the necessary tools and parts. Disconnect the power by flipping the breaker. Remove any glass covers or shades. Lower the fixture and let it hang to examine the connections. Remove the screws or post connecting the socket. Separate the wires coming out of the ceiling and leave the junction box alone. Write down which wires are connected to which and label them. Make sure the ends of the wires from the fixture are stripped about 1/2". Prep the new fixture by removing glass cover and bulbs. Connect the wires to the new fixture. Make sure no exposed wire is sticking out beneath the wire nuts. Fold all the wires back gently into the junction box. Test your work.
Sing a note that's comfortable and within your range. Find the note that's in the middle of your register or the note that's closest to your speaking voice or chest voice. This will be a starting point before you go into your subharmonic or lower range.  If you're unsure of your vocal range, read Find Your Vocal Range. Tenor's vocal range is in between C3 to B4. Baritone range is usually between G2 and a G4. Bass singer's range is typically between D2 and an E4.; , Slide the note slightly a half-note up and then bring your singing voice all the way down to the lowest note you can comfortably sing. Sustain the lowest note you can without your voice cracking or popping., Bring your voice the fifth note from what you were singing. Play a piano note in tandem with your voice so that you can correctly raise the note a fifth. This is the note you'll be in when singing in your subharmonic range. This should also be one octave below your chest voice.If your chest voice is an A1 note your subharmonic tone should be in A2.	Sing any note naturally. Slide the tone up and then down to the lowest note you can sing. Sing the note a fifth up from your lowest register.

You probably were assigned the SCRAM bracelet as part of your probation. You should talk to your probation officer about why you want to remove the bracelet. If you can get your officer to agree, then you will have a stronger argument.; , Generally, judges are not anxious to remove the bracelet. In fact, they might have given you a choice: wear the SCRAM device or go to jail. Before asking a judge to remove the bracelet early, you need to identify solid reasons for doing so:   The bracelet has issued “false positives.” This means the bracelet detects alcohol when you haven’t been drinking. You will need proof that you haven’t consumed alcohol, such as a hair test or a polygraph exam. You will have to pay for both. If you pass them, then they are solid proof that the device is inaccurate.The device is unnecessary. If you have gone several months without a drink, then you could argue that the device is no longer needed. You would prefer to take in-person tests. The judge might have given you an option to wear the device or take tests in person.You might have initially chosen the SCRAM device but have now changed your mind.  Anytime you want the judge to do something, you need to file a “motion” with the court. You can begin drafting your motion by opening a blank word processing document. Set the font to 14 point Arial or Times New Roman. Also double-space the document.Your court may have printed forms you can use. You should look on the court’s website or stop in and ask the court clerk.  The caption information appears at the top of the first page of every motion filed with the court. It stays the same throughout the prosecution, so if you’ve never drafted a motion before, then you can look at any document filed in your case to find the caption. The caption includes:   The name of the court. The names of the parties. Typically, the state is the “prosecutor” and you are the defendant. The case number.  You can title your motion “Defendant’s Motion To Modify Probation.” If you want to terminate probation, then you could title it “Defendant’s Motion To Terminate Probation.”You should insert the title underneath the caption.   You may have been ordered to wear the bracelet as a condition of bail. If so, you should title your motion “Motion to Modify Bail.”  , In your introduction, you should identify yourself and then state whether you are representing yourself (called representing yourself “pro se”). Then you should explain what you want the judge to do. Sample language could read:   “COMES NOW Defendant, Sam Smith, representing himself pro se, who moves this Court to modify his probation. In support of the motion, Defendant states the following….”, The judge might have forgotten who you are, so you should provide helpful information to catch the judge up to speed. Make sure to number your paragraphs. Provide the following information:   The date you were placed on probation. How long probation should last. The fact that you were given a SCRAM bracelet as one condition of your probation.  You also have to give the judge a reason to remove the bracelet early. Decide whether you are seeking to only have the bracelet removed or if you want your probation to end early. You could argue:   The bracelet is unreliable. There is some proof that SCRAM bracelets are not as effective at detecting alcohol use as some judges might believe. You could argue that the bracelet is faulty and that it has registered false positives. Point to hair tests and polygraphs which show you didn’t drink. You could also mention an article by Judge Dennis N. Powers called “The SCRAM Tether as Seen Through the Eyes of Davis-Frye and Daubert.” In this article, a Michigan judge argues that the SCRAM device is not sufficiently reliable to qualify as expert evidence.There are alternatives that are less burdensome. You would have a stronger argument if you give the judge some alternatives for monitoring your alcohol consumption. For example, you could take tests in person. You have satisfied all other conditions of your probation. For example, if you have been ordered to pay a fine and do community service, make sure you are diligently working toward completing those requirements. Whether your probation officer agrees. If so, be sure to mention that fact.  Briefly restate that you want the judge to remove the SCRAM device. Also be sure to include the date and your signature just below the conclusion. A sample conclusion could read:   “WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court grant the Motion to Modify Probation and issue an Order to that effect.”, You will have to provide a copy of your motion to the prosecutor and your probation officer. You will certify that you sent a copy of the motion to each. You can type up your certificate of service on a separate sheet of paper but include it with your motion.   The certificate should state how you sent the motion to the other parties. For example, it could read: “I certify that I sent a true and correct copy of this motion to this 20th day of April, 2016.”, The “order” is what the judge signs if he or she agrees that your SCRAM device should be removed early. You may have to draft a proposed order and submit it with your motion. You should type it up on a separate sheet of paper.   Insert the caption information at the top. The order can read something like the following: “Hearing held on the motion this 20th of May, 2016, the Court finds good cause and it is hereby ORDERED that the Defendant’s Motion to Modify Probation is GRANTED.” Then include a signature line for the judge., It is best to keep one copy of your motion for your own records. You also will need to send a copy to the prosecutor and your probation officer. Some courts also require that you file copies along with the original.Contact the court clerk and ask how many copies you need to file.  Before the judge can modify your probation, you must attend a hearing. For this reason, you should get a hearing date from the court clerk. Each court handles the scheduling of hearings a little differently. Ask the clerk how you can schedule a hearing.   You may also have to fill out a Notice of Hearing form. The clerk should have a form. If there’s no form, then draft your own. Insert the caption information at the top and title the document “Notice of Hearing.” Then state the date, time, and location of the hearing. Sign the notice as well., You should take the original and copies to the court clerk. Ask to file.The clerk can stamp all of your copies with the filing date. Depending on your court, you may also have to pay a filing fee.   You should check with the clerk ahead of time and ask for the amount and acceptable methods of payment. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form.  Use the method identified in your certificate of service to send the prosecutor (and probably your probation officer) a copy of your motion. They will also need a copy of the Notice of Hearing so that they can attend if they object to your getting the SCRAM device removed early., You want to look your best for your hearing. The judge will only agree to remove the SCRAM bracelet early if he or she is confident that you’ll not violate the other terms of your probation. You need to show the judge that you are responsible, and dressing in clean, neat clothes will help convince the judge.Men can wear business casual: dress pants and a dress shirt with a collar. If you have a conservative tie, then wear that as well. For footwear, men should wear dress shoes with dark socks. Women can also wear business casual: dress slacks or a skirt paired with a blouse or nice sweater. Women can also wear conservative dresses, but they must not be too tight or revealing. Men and women should both avoid wearing blue jeans, unless they have no other long pants. Also avoid shorts, baseball caps, T-shirts, and anything with writing on it.  In addition to a copy of your motion, you should also bring any proof that you have completed other conditions of your probation.For example, if you performed a sufficient number of community service hours, then you should have some sort of signed document attesting to that fact.  Give yourself enough time to find parking around the courthouse and to go through any security. Plan on getting to the courtroom 15 minutes before your hearing. If you are late, then the judge will reject your motion.   Also make sure to turn off your electronic devices before entering the courtroom.Nothing could be worse than having your phone ring or beep.  When the clerk calls your name, you should go to the front of the courtroom. You will make your argument first. You should introduce yourself: “Your Honor, I’m Sam Smith, representing myself.”   Limit your argument to those you made in your motion. You can’t make new arguments during the hearing. If the judge has questions, listen quietly. Don’t talk over the judge, and always call the judge “Your Honor.”, If either objects to the device’s removal, then they will tell the judge why. You have to quietly listen to them talk. If they say anything you want to respond to, then write down your objection on a piece of paper.   Don’t interrupt, and don’t raise your hand to ask to speak.Wait until they are finished, and then ask the judge, “Your Honor, may I respond?”  , At the end of the hearing, the judge should decide whether to remove your SCRAM device. If the judge agrees, then he or she will sign the order you provided. You should get a copy of the signed order from the clerk.   You will also have to coordinate a time to have the device removed.	Talk to your probation officer. Identify why you want the device removed. Format your motion. Insert the caption. Add your title. Include an introduction. Provide important background facts. Explain why the judge should remove the bracelet. Conclude your motion. Draft a certificate of service. Create a proposed order. Make several copies of the motion. Schedule a hearing date. File your motion with the court. Send notice to the prosecutor. Dress appropriately. Bring helpful documents. Arrive at court on time. Make your argument. Listen to any objections by the prosecutor or probation officer. Receive the judge’s decision.
If you want to join multiple pieces of silver together, soldering is typically the easiest home method. It still requires quite a bit of preparation, and the following materials:   Use a "medium" or "hard" silver solder made from silver alloy, not standard solder. Avoid solder containing cadmium unless you have a respirator. A small oxy-acetylene or butane torch, preferably with a flat "chisel tip." Any brazing or soldering flux labeled as suitable for silver. Copper tongs and tweezers (of any metal) for handling the silver. A "pickle" solution for soldering, heated according to label instructions before you begin.  You'll need a well-ventilated room and a heat-resistant work table, plus a heat brick to work on. Goggles are essential for detail work, to protect yourself from spatter during close inspection. Gloves, a denim or leather apron and tight-fitting, non-synthetic clothing are good additional precautions.   You'll need a container of water anyway to rinse the jewelry, but a fire extinguisher doesn't hurt if you are working in a room with flammable materials.  If the silver is greasy or has been heavily handled, rub on a degreasing solution. Dip in the pickle solution if the silver is black from oxidization. Once clean, brush the flux onto the silver, over the areas to be joined.   Powdered flux must be mixed into a paste or liquid form first. Check the instructions for details.  If you have never soldered anything before, this in-depth guide may help. Alternatively, you can follow these quick steps:   Position the objects carefully on the heat brick, then apply a chip of solder (or a dab of solder paste) with tweezers. Heat from about 4 inches (10 cm) away, focusing on the thicker piece of silver. Do not heat solder directly. Hold thin pieces of silver with tweezers to prevent melting.  Once the solder has melted along the gap between the pieces, turn off the heat and wait a minute or two for the solder to solidify. Use your copper tongs to dip the silver first into the water bath, then into the pickle solution to remove oxidization created during soldering. Rinse a final time in water, then pat dry.   Avoid putting the pickle in contact with skin and clothes, as it can be corrosive. Non-copper tongs may react with the pickle, corroding the metal. If you prefer the look of "aged" silver, you can skip the pickle.  These are best added to jewelry with a two-part epoxy glue. Solder a silver "bezel cup" to the jewelry, sand the walls down if necessary with coarse sandpaper, then glue in the stone and let dry as instructed by the epoxy label.	Gather materials. Set up a safe work area. Clean and apply flux. Solder the silver. Rinse, pickle, and rinse again. Add gemstone or glass (optional).
Dye your hair warm blonde or sport a wig. The higher quality of your dye or wig, the more convincing your cosplay as Elle will be. Curl the ends of your hair softly to achieve that feminine sweetness. Change your hairstyle frequently.; , Even if you're going to the grocery store, deck yourself out. You can layer on some accessories such as celebrity-inspired sunglasses or diva-esque jewelry. This is the chance for you to strut your stuff.   If you wear another color, make sure it matches with the pink in your outfit. You can wear a fabulous pink pantsuit or a tailored pink blazer to look professional yet chic.  Dress the dog in pink to match your outfit!   You may be tempted to set your dog on a vegetarian diet, as Elle does, but under no circumstances should you do this. The verdict is still out on whether dogs are omnivores or carnivores, and there haven't been enough conclusive studies on whether or not a vegetarian diet is good for dogs. It's best to just feed your dog normal dog food and avoid the possible consequences of deviating from a vet-approved diet.  Keep in mind that Elle is a vegetarian. She's also very physically fit, so it's a good idea to exercise regularly. Sign up for gym membership if you haven't.  Never let anyone catch you unpolished when you're Elle. Make sure your make-up is enhancing you and your outfit. Do not overdo it. Look classy and fresh with natural eyeliner, a bit of eyeshadow, and some lipgloss or lipstick. You want to look groomed, not like you're a member of the cabaret.	Your hair must be blonde. Wear pink and dress up for any and every occasion. Get a cute toy dog, preferably a chihuahua (like Elle's). Stay on a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Wear make-up.
The hem on a curtain lining should be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) narrower than the hem on the curtain. For example, if your curtain has a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) wide hem, the hem on the lining should be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide.You'll need to cut your lining 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) longer than you want it to be.   Curtain linings are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the curtain. Plan accordingly., Curtain linings are usually tucked into the side hem. If you are hemming a store-bought curtain, this could be a problem, depending on how short you are cutting and hemming your curtain. Use a seam ripper to undo the bottom portion of each side hem, and trim the lining down to the length you need. You will tuck it back into the side hems later.  How much you fold it up will depend on how wide you want the hem to be. For example, if your hem to be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters), fold it up by 3 inches (7.62 centimeters). If necessary, use sewing pins to hold the hem in place. Be sure to remove the pins once you are done ironing.   Make sure that you are folding the hem inside the curtain. You do not want the hem to be visible from the outside. The bottom edge of the lining should rest 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the bottom edge of the curtain when you are done. The bottom edges of the curtain and the lining should not be aligned.  Cut a piece of hem tape slightly shorter than the width of your lining. Tuck it inside the hem, aligning the top edge with the top of the folded hem. Iron the hem down.  Try to sew as close to the top folded edge as you can. Use a color that matches the lining color as closely as possible.  Be sure to tuck the lining into hem before you sew it down. Using hem tape for this would not be a good idea, especially if the rest of the side hem is sewn. You can sew it either by hand or on a sewing machine. Try to match the original thread color and stitch length as best as you can.	Make sure you have enough fabric for a double-folded hem. Undo part of the side hem, if necessary. Fold the lining inside the curtain twice and press it flat with an iron. Consider using iron-on hem tape to fuse the hem to the lining. Consider using a sewing machine to sew the hem. Sew the side hems down, if you unraveled them earlier.
Most local papers and newsletters contain a section devoted to classified listings. Depending on the circulation of the paper and the size of your ad, this can be a cheap way to find possible buyers. The drawback is that your car may take longer to sell because it’s not as visible as other options.   For example, you might write, "Reliable Car for Sale: 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe, Red, 25,0000 miles, One Owner, Maintenance Records and Vehicle History available upon request, Asking Price $7,000 OBO, Call XXX-XXX-XXXX for more details."  , Create a simple flyer that contains a clear picture of your car, the price, any details on the make and model, and your contact information. Attach these flyers to message boards at your office, church, grocery store, library, and even gym. Include rip-off tabs at the bottom of the sheet to make it easy for buyers to get ahold of you.Try printing out your flyers on colored paper to get even more attention. Just make sure that this does not distort the appearance of your car’s photo. Go around every few days and make sure that your flyers are still in place. If the location has removed them, it is okay to ask if there is an approved area for posting.  If you have a regular mechanic that you go to, tell them that you are selling your car and would like any advice that they can offer. They might even let you park it on their lot. Or, they may just spread the word to other customers or let you put up a flyer in their waiting room.Your mechanic may be able to tell you which features to emphasize, such as especially good tires or a solid alarm system.  If you already have another vehicle, park your car off to the side of a main road with "for sale" written in big letters on the windshield. Then, on the other windows, write more details about the car, like the asking price, mileage, and year. If you don’t have another car yet, simply write the same information on one or two side windows and continue to drive it around.After you finish the sign, take a good number of steps back and look at it. Make sure that other people could read it from afar.	Take out an ad in your newspaper. Post paper signs throughout your community. Enlist your mechanic’s help. Write "for sale" on your car with window paint.
To build your homemade gong, you will need a disposable cake or pie pan, an electric drill, and some string or twine for hanging it. You can use nearly anything for a mallet, but it will need to have a long handle and a relatively soft head.; , The gong will need holes to be suspended with the string. Begin by fitting your electric drill with a bit just wider in diameter than your string. Drill 2 holes near the top of the pan, about 6 inches (15 cm) apart.  Begin by passing the string through the first hole from back to front, and then pass the string through the second hole from front to back. Tie the loose end of the string to the other side of the string to create a loop of string about the same diameter as the pie pan. Cut off any excess string with scissors.  You can improvise a gong mallet from materials you already have in your home. For example, a small mallet can be made by poking the tip of a pencil through a wine cork. Hold the pencil in your hand and strike the center of the gong with the cork end. An alternative is to take a long object such as a pencil or wooden spoon and wrap electric tape thickly around one end to form a bulb shape. Use the taped end for striking the gong.  The gong can be played by holding it from the stringed loop and striking it with your free hand. If you want to mount your Chinese gong from a stand, however, you can build one from materials you have around your home. The string loop should be hung from a horizontal brace supported by 2 vertical pillars on each side. These supports can be made from cardboard, PVC pipe, or any other sturdy household material you have.	Gather your materials. Drill holes in the pie pan for hanging. Loop the string through the gong. Construct a mallet for striking the gong. Suspend the gong from a stand if desired.
Making a crocheted cell phone case is much easier than it might seem. You just need a few things to do it. You will need:Yarn in the color and type of your choice A crochet hook appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. Be sure to check the label of your yarn for recommendations on what size hook to use with the yarn. Scissors Button Needle and thread; , You don’t need to worry about measuring your phone to get the right measurements for your cell phone case. All you need to do is to make a chain long enough to wrap around your cell phone width-wise.The chain should be snug, but not super tight. If the chain is too tight, add a chain or two. If it is too loose, take a couple of chains out. Leave a long tail of about 10 to 12 inches (25 to 20 cm). You can use this yarn to sew the bottom closed after you finish making the case.  Next, you will need to connect the beginning and end of the chain to begin crocheting in rounds. With the loop still on your hook from the last chain you crocheted, insert the crochet hook into the first link in your chain. Then, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through both stitches to secure them together.Your chain should now be connected in a circle.  Once the chain is a circle, you can begin single crocheting around it.Start by inserting the hook into the first stitch in the round. Then, loop the yarn over and pull this yarn through the first loop. Loop the yarn over the hook again and then pull this yarn through both stitches on the hook. This will complete your first single crochet stitch.Single crochet to the last stitch in the round, and then slipstitch to connect the first and last stitches. If you prefer to use a different type of stitch, then you can. For example, you could try the double crochet stitch, popcorn stitch, or cluster stitch. Be careful not to twist the stitches.  You will need to continue to single crochet all rounds until the case is long enough to hold your cell phone. Once it looks like you are getting close, try slipping your cell phone into the case to see how far you have to go. Keep going until your entire cell phone fits in the case., After you have achieved your desired length for the cell phone case, you will need to bind off your work. To do this, cut the free end of the yarn a few inches away from the hook, and then pull it out through your last loop to secure it.   To deal with the tail, you can either weave in the end using a darning needle, or tie it in a second knot and cut the excess., Use the tail that you left at the beginning of making the case to sew the bottom of the case closed. If you did not leave a long enough tail, then tie a 10 to 12 inch (25 to 30 cm) piece of yarn to the tail and thread it through a darning needle. Then, stitch along the bottom of the cell phone case to close it.  To make a closure for your cell phone, case, the first thing you will need to do is to sew a button onto one side of the case. You can choose any type of button you like. However, keep in mind that a larger button may provide a more secure hold.Use a needle and thread to sew the button into place. Try to position it in the center top portion of the case.  Next, tie a piece of yarn to one of the stitches in the back of the case. Then, begin making a chain. Crochet a chain that it long enough to extend to the front of the case, loop around the button, and then connect back to the same spot in the back of the case.Do this with the phone in the case. Having the phone in the case will give you a more accurate idea of how secure the button and chain closure will be.  After the chain is the desired length, snip the free end and pull the end through the loop to secure the chain. Then tie this end to the back of the case near the beginning of the chain.Your cell phone case it now ready to use! You can keep it as is, or add a chain handle.  To make it easier to carry your crocheted cell phone case, you may want to make a handle. However, keep in mind that this is optional. You can make a short length handle to carry your cell phone like a clutch, or you can add a long chain handle to carry your cell phone like a purse.  Tie a piece of yarn to the case where you want one end of the handle to begin. Then, begin to crochet a chain. Make the chain as long as you want it to be.  When your handle is the desired length, cut the free end a few inches away from the hook. Then, pull the end through your last loop to secure the end of the chain. Then, tie this end to the case where you want the other end to be. This will complete a simple chain handle.   If desired, you can single crochet along the chain one or more times to make a thicker handle.	Gather your tools and materials. Chain enough stitches to wrap around your cell phone. Connect the chain with a slipstitch. Single crochet around the chain. Continue to single crochet all rounds. Bind off. Sew the bottom closed. Sew on a button. Make a chain extending from the back of the case. Attach the other end of the chain. Decide what type of handle you want to add. Make a chain long enough for your handle. Tie off the chain at the end.
Begin by turning off the shutoff valve on the water supply line. Then flush the toilet to remove all the water from the tank and the bowl. Disconnect both ends of the water supply tube at the shutoff valve and at the toilet tank.   You want the toilet and tank to be as dry as possible before you remove it, so go a step further and use a sponge to soak up any water that's left after you flush.; , Use a ratchet wrench or a basin wrench to remove the nuts from the mounting bolts that hold the tank onto the bowl. There will be one on each side of the tank, and there may even be a third one in the middle. Gently lift the tank off the bowl.   Once the tank is off , remove it from the bathroom or set it to the side or somewhere it won't be in the way.  Pry the trim caps off the floor bolts. Use an adjustable wrench to remove the nuts from the floor bolts.   If you can't get the nuts off, try spraying them with penetrating oil. If you're still unsuccessful, you may have to use a nut splitter or cut the bolts with a hacksaw.  There is a wax ring under the toilet that seals the bottom of the bowl to the end of the drain pipe (called the toilet flange). Straddle the toilet and gently rock it from side to side in order to break the seal. Once you do, lift off the bowl and place it nearby on its side.  Using a putty knife, scrape away the old wax from the toilet flange and from the bottom of the toilet. Throw the old wax in a bucket line with a plastic bag. Clean the flange with a stiff wire brush.  Put a rag inside the toilet flange/drainpipe to keep sewer gases from coming into the bathroom. Place a bucket upside-down over your rag.	Get rid of the water. Take off the tank. Remove the floor bolts. Break the seal. Conduct some clean up. Seal the hole.
God will hear your prayers whether or not you are following Him, but He is more likely to answer those who are close to Him. If you’ve never started reading God’s Word and following Jesus, that’s a good step before you ask Him for something. Learn to listen and obey what He asks of you.This is not to say that He won’t grant your request if you aren’t a follower. It simply means that you’ll be better able to communicate with Him if you have a relationship with Him. Think about the difference between a stranger and your best friend. If a friend asks to borrow some money or a stranger on the street asks, you’d be more likely to give to your friend. It’s not a perfect comparison, but it’s similar.; , When you come to God in prayer, don’t go straight to asking for something. It is better to praise Him and thank Him for what He has already done. Praise Him for being loving and mighty. Thank Him for guiding you and blessing you. Beginning this way shows God that He is more than someone you ask for things.Praise and thanks must be genuine, not a tactic to butter God up so you can ask for what you want. You must really mean what you pray. Start by saying, “God, it’s amazing how well you have taken care of me and provided for me. I’m thankful that you are strong and that you never turn away from me.”  , After you have a relationship with God, it is important to make sure you’re on good terms with Him. If you are living in ongoing sin, or you’ve committed sins recently, you are separated from God. You must confess those things and turn away from them. This will mend the broken connection with God.The reason this is important is that sin means going against what God wants from you. When you sin, you separate yourself from God. To confess and repent simply means to tell God that you know you have sinned, that you are sorry, and that you want to change. Pray to God, “I’m sorry I was so rude to my neighbor. I know you love Him, too, and I should treat Him as you want me to. I will work harder at being patient and kind to Him.”  , Along with confessing and repenting, ask God to forgive you for those sins. Seeking forgiveness is the step that has to follow confession. Once God has forgiven you, the lines of communication will be much more open between you and God.There is not a specific prayer of forgiveness you must pray. Tell God that you are sorry and that you want Him to forgive you for wronging Him. Pray, “God, I’m sorry for lying about what I did last night. I should not have done that. Please forgive me for my dishonesty.”  , If you are angry or have hurt someone, it’s hard to pray an honest prayer to God. Take a minute to think about any relationships you have that are out of sync and make an effort to fix those first. Resolving problems with others opens you up more to asking something from God.It’s not enough to think of what’s wrong if you don’t make an effort to fix it. Get in touch with the person and seek reconciliation before going to God. Apologize to them or forgive them, depending on what is wrong between you.  If you are living for God, you may have evil that is against you, holding you back from God. Pray that God would remove any spirits who seek to keep you distant and distracted from God. Spiritual warfare will keep you from being able to effectively communicate with God.It may be worth your time to learn more about what spiritual warfare is and how it can affect your prayer life and living for God. Pray, “God, I feel like there is evil that is surrounding me. In Jesus' name, please rebuke these spirits. Do not let them come between us. Tell them that they have no power over me.”  , God knows everything you think and feel, so there is no sense in hiding. As you are asking for what you want, be completely honest about your thoughts and feelings. Honesty will open God’s ears to your prayers.  Tell God what you want or need and ask Him to provide that for you. Be specific about your request. Even though God knows what you want and need, He wants you to ask Him for it. God can answer vague prayers, but being specific creates a deeper bond between you and Him.Being specific does not guarantee that God will answer your request in the way you want Him to. He may have other plans for you. Say to God, “I’m hurting for rent money this month because of the doctor bills. Please let me pick up some extra hours at work so that I can pay my rent.” Remember that God will not give you something that goes against His will. Check your heart and check the Bible to see if what you are asking for is against His will.  Although you may have many specific things you want from God, another good thing to pray is that His will be done in your life. Ask Him to move and use you however He wants, not only how you want. Ask Him to help you want the things that He wants for you.The benefits of praying in this way are many. Although you may know exactly what you want, God may have much more for you than you could think to ask for. If you only ask for the thing you want, you could miss out on a larger blessing. Say to God, “Lord, I really want to start a new job this month, but I know that you might have something more in store for me during this time. I pray that you would show me your plans, even if it isn’t exactly what I want.”  , If you are asking God for something, you probably want Him to act quickly. Being honest with God means telling Him that you want Him to work quickly. He is on His own time, so it may not happen at the speed you want. It is still good to ask Him to hurry because you’re being honest about what you want., Every time you pray, but especially when you are asking for something, end by saying, “I pray this in Jesus’ name.” This acknowledges that God moves through Jesus and that Jesus is powerful.This is not like saying magic words, and it should not be used as a way to exploit God’s blessings. It is simply a way to show that you are submitting to God’s will through Christ.  Remember that God works on a different timeline than you do. If He doesn’t answer as quickly as you hoped, do not give up on Him. Wait on His timing and remember that there may be a reason He does not answer as quickly as you want Him to., While you wait to hear God’s answer to your prayer, you must keep honoring Him and giving Him praise. It is important to be be thankful and worshipful even when you haven’t received what you want yet. If you only praise Him when He acts as you want, your praise may not be genuine., If you don't believe that God has the power to act, your prayer loses power. You must believe that He has heard you and will act based on His will. If your request fits His plan, then he will grant what you want, but remember that God doesn't always answer the way you want Him to.	Build a relationship with God. Praise God and give thanks first. Confess and repent of sin. Ask God for forgiveness. Make amends with other people. Pray against evil that may be around you. Be honest with God about what you are feeling. Ask God specifically for what you want. Invite God to work in the ways He wants to work. Call on God to hurry in answering your request. Close by saying, “In Jesus' name.” The Bible teaches that the name of Jesus Christ is powerful. Be patient waiting for God to Work. Continue to praise Him. Trust that God will act according to his will.
Modifying your car to increase its performance will do you very little good if you fail to stay on top of the required maintenance that keeps your car running smoothly. By changing your oil regularly, ensuring your tires are properly inflated, and following the recommended schedule of service for your vehicle, you can make your vehicle perform better and last longer. Check your vehicle’s owner manual for recommended service at different mileage points. Some cars may require timing belt or chain adjustments or fluid changes at specific mileage markers to ensure the vehicle continues to run as it was designed.Professional “tune ups” that include air and fuel filter changes, spark plugs, and even transmission fluid and filter changes are a great way to keep your vehicle running properly. Ensure your tires are inflated to their recommended pressure to improve fuel economy and extend the life of the tire.; , Think of your car as an athlete running a race; the intake on your car is the way it breathes in as it runs. Stock intakes are designed for a number of purposes that include things like reducing engine noise. By replacing your stock intake pipe with one that was designed to maximize power, you will not only increase horsepower, but fuel efficiency as well. Cold air intakes often have a larger diameter than the stock pipe and are designed to take the most direct route to the throttle body as possible.Cold air intakes usually include an aftermarket air filter that increases the filter surface. This allows for more air to travel through it at a higher volume. Some cold air intakes even include heat shielding to prevent the engine temperature from warming the air as it travels into the engine. The cooler the air, the denser it is with oxygen, allowing for a hotter burn which creates more horsepower.  If the intake is how an athlete (your car) breathes in as it runs, the exhaust is how it breathes back out. There are a number of options available to you when it comes to installing higher flowing exhausts. Many people opt to install a catalyst-back aftermarket exhaust, which replaces the piping from your catalytic converter(s) to the muffler. Higher flowing catalytic converters, front pipes and even exhaust manifolds are all also common modifications. Replacing the entire exhaust system (from exhaust manifold to muffler) will maximize the performance of your engine.Larger diameter, higher flowing exhaust systems have a more significant effect on turbocharged vehicles. The increased exhaust flow also serves to increase the efficiency of the turbocharger. Some states have strict regulations about replacing your catalytic converters. Check on the website of your local Department of Motor Vehicles prior to modifying or replacing your catalytic converter.  The engine control unit (ECU) in modern cars keeps the engine running smoothly. The ECU adjusts the air/fuel ratio of your engine to keep things consistent regardless of air density (altitude) and temperature. If your engine begins to run lean (too much oxygen), the ECU will add fuel to the mixture to re-achieve balance, and vice versa if the engine starts to run rich (too much fuel). The ratio the ECU maintains is established at the factory and based on a number of factors such as reducing emissions and increasing reliability. By using a programmer or taking your car to a performance shop to have your ECU flashed with a new program that prioritizes performance, you can free up power and even increase gas mileage.Some vehicles can be reprogrammed through their OBDII ports using programmers you can buy for your specific vehicle or “chips” you can install. Higher end models of these programmers allow you to utilize more than one program or profile. This allows you to switch between air/fuel ratios that prioritize performance, gas mileage, or even using lower octane fuel.  Tires are extremely important to the performance of your car. Good traction determines your car’s ability to put the power it produces to the ground; it’s the difference between getting a good launch and burning your tires at the starting line. Most people choose performance tires designed with a compromise between maximizing the tire’s “footprint” and allowing for water displacing tread.Pay attention to the speed rating on the tires you purchase. The rating is usually a single letter that refers to the maximum speed the tire is rated for. Most cars come with “S” rated tires that are safe up to 112 miles per hour. Many performance tires carry a “Z” rating, which is rated for speeds in excess of 149 miles per hour.Some high performance tires produce more ride noise than their stock alternatives.  Spark plugs produce the electrical spark that ignites the mixture of air and fuel in each cylinder of your engine. Over time, they can wear out or become ruined by unfavorable running conditions such as running too lean or rich. Compromised spark plugs have limited ability to ignite the air/fuel mixture, which may result in the engine misfiring. There are many different options when it comes to spark plugs, so do some research or consult the clerk at your local auto parts store when choosing spark plugs to install in your engine. Spark plugs should be replaced at regular intervals as a part of your normal vehicle maintenance to ensure they don’t corrode or fail.Some spark plugs are made from different materials: copper conducts best but has to be replaced far more often due to corrosion, so many people choose iridium plugs for performance applications as they conduct nearly as well and last much longer. Make sure you consult your car’s repair manual when gapping your spark plugs before you install them. The gap on the spark plug is the distance the spark needs to arc from one piece of the plug to another. An incorrect gap height can compromise the plug’s ability to ignite the air fuel mixture.	Make simple adjustments to maximize fuel economy and power. Install a cold air intake. Purchase a higher flowing exhaust. Reprogram your engine control unit. Swap your tires for high performance alternatives. Replace your spark plugs.
Before you make plans to winterize your hibiscus, it's important to identify whether it is a hardy or tropical variety. Hardy varieties can survive the winter outdoors in zones higher than 5(see tips for more info), but tropical varieties will need to be transplanted to a container and moved indoors once temperatures drop below 50 °F (10 °C).   Tropical varieties typically have dark, glossy leaves and smaller flowers. Their flowers are more likely to be bi-colored, but some solid color varieties do exist. Temperatures below 25 °F (−4 °C) will prove fatal to these plants. Hardy hibiscuses have rougher, duller leaves and huge blossoms. They are more resistant to cold temperatures than their tropical contemporaries.; , Feed the hibiscus plant with a potassium fertilizer in October or November to encourage profuse blooming the following year.   Do not give it a nitrogen at this time - nitrogen will encourage new leafy growth that will only be damaged by cold weather or lost during the winter.  Water the hibiscus generously once every week or two if it does not rain. Clear any fallen leaves and other debris away from the stems to help prevent disease.   These few extra steps in the fall will help them rebound in the spring to return with a flourish of lush green foliage and beautiful flowers. Once you have mulched the soil you will no longer have to perform these actions.  Heavy layers of mulch will protect the hibiscuses from any unexpected dips in temperature. Adding a layer of compost under the mulch may also help protect these plants.   Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of organic mulch over the root zone but keep the mulch a few inches away from the stems. If it already has mulch around it, loosen the mulch with a rake and add new mulch, if necessary, to bring the total depth up to 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm).  The effects of freezing temperatures can be somewhat negated by using frost cloths. Areas that don’t get a lot of frost can protect plants during uncharacteristically cold winters by using Christmas tree lights strung over the plant and plugged into to the nearest outlet.   These lights can be utilized in conjunction underneath frost cloths or they can be used on their own.  If your tropical hibiscus is planted in the ground, you will need to transfer it to a large container so it can be overwintered indoors. Use houseplant potting soil when replanting, rather than garden soil.   To dig up the hibiscus, push the shovel into the soil 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the stems, all the way around the hibiscus to sever the root. Then lift it with the tip of the shovel.  Gardeners should carefully check their container-grown hibiscuses for any sign of insects a few days before temperatures are due to start dropping.   If harmful insects are noted, gardeners should apply a suitable pesticide. This is best done a few days before bringing the hibiscus indoors, especially if one has family members that are prone to allergies.  It’s a good idea to rinse the plants off a few times before bringing them indoors. This helps get rid of any bugs that may be lurking in the foliage as well as any dirt or pollen that might still be on the leaves.   Wiping down the container that the hibiscus is in with a damp rag will also help to reduce the amount of dirt and allergens that are brought inside.  Adding a time-released fertilizer such as Osmocote to the plant before bringing it indoors can be helpful, because hibiscuses that are fertilized regularly will return more quickly in the spring.  Plants that have gotten too large may need to be pruned before the winter Hibiscuses are generally tolerant of heavy pruning so clipping them into shape shouldn’t cause any problems.   Since hibiscuses bloom on new stem growth, fall pruning will help them bloom more profusely the following spring and summer. To get even more flowers, pinch the tips of the new stems after they get to about 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, and again when they reach 1 foot (0.3 m) long. Pinching will cause more branching, resulting in an abundance of new stems and flowers.  Once indoors for the winter, the hibiscus will still need proper care if it is to survive the long months ahead. Gardeners are advised to look up the plant that they have and treat it accordingly rather than make general assumptions.   However, if the plant tag is lost or if the plant was a gift from friends, this article will provide some tips that apply to most hibiscuses.  Hibiscuses need both warmth and light to flourish indoors, but will take the warmth over the light if they must. Ideally, these plants should be placed beside a window in the toastiest possible location.   Plants that spend their winters in a room with no windows or in one that has low lighting will benefit from having their own lamp. However, gardeners should take care to keep the device far enough away from the plants that it doesn’t burn them. Hibiscuses kept in outbuildings will likely need a heater of some type to keep them warm enough to survive but even a tiny space heater will adequately serve this purpose.  Tropical plants generally prefer for the temperature to remain above 55 °F (13 °C). However, cold tolerance does vary by species and gardeners will need to check their plant’s specific needs.  Direct sunlight is recommended for most hibiscus species but some can take a bit less. If the leaves on the plant begin to appear browned or scorched, it might be best to move them to a situation with less light.  Water the hibiscus according to the individual varieties needs. For example:   In the wintertime, Chinese Hibiscuses (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) will only need to be watered enough to keep the soil from drying out, while Mallow cultivars (Hibiscus moscheutos) will require moderate levels of moisture. Gardeners should be aware that the Mallow types do not handle drought or being overwatered very well.	Identify whether the hibiscus plant is tropical or hardy. Feed the hibiscus with a potassium fertilizer in late fall/early winter. Care for the hibiscus plant throughout the fall months. Apply a heavy layer of mulch to the soil around the plant. Protect the hibiscus plants from frost. Transplant tropical hibiscus into pots. Check the container-grown hibiscus for any signs of infestation. Rinse the plant before bringing it indoors. Fertilize the plant. Prune the hibiscus plant to make it more manageable. Look up care instructions for your specific variety of hibiscus. Provide the hibiscus with warmth and/or light. Keep the temperature above 55 °F (13 °C), if possible. Prevent the leaves from becoming scorched. Make sure that the soil is kept moist.
When you speak to others for referrals, ask about the situation that required them to seek an HVAC contractor in the first place. This will give you a better idea regarding whether that specific contractor will best suit your needs. If you can't get direct referrals, search local business directories with customer reviews. Don't base your choice on a nice contractor website only.; ,   If you are unsure which licenses and certifications HVAC contractors are required to have, you may want to find out by contacting a government official or representative from your local area or state. You may also visit the Contractor's License website found in the Sources section of this article to determine the licenses needed in each state and also to verify the license validity of a specific contractor. Ask the HVAC contractor to show you copies of their current licenses or certifications. You may also want to find out if the contractor has worker's compensation insurance in the event they are injured on your property. ,   Visit the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website listed in the Sources section of this article to research an HVAC contractor and their business or contact the Council of BBB for feedback.

This will be the length of your glove. The finished glove will extend from the top of your palm/knuckles, down past your wrist, and onto your forearm. If you want a shorter glove, cast on fewer stitches. If you want a longer glove, cast on more stitches.Leave a long tail on you yarn. You'll be using it to stitch the glove together in the end. Use medium worsted weight yarn (size 4) and size 8 knitting needles.; , This will create a bumpy, purl pattern on both sides of you work. How many rows you knit depends on how wide your palm/forearm is. For most people, however, this will be about 48 rows.Do not alternate between knitting and purling. You want to knit on every row. This will allow the glove to stretch both ways  , Cast off your work first. Cut the yarn, and pull the tail end through the last loop. Gently tug on the tail end to tighten the loop. Do not cut the tail end off.  The cast on and cast off stitches should run up the side of your arm and palm. The side edges of the piece are now the top and bottom of your glove. Place your hand over the folded piece, with the top of your palm against the top edge. Take note where you thumb starts.  Thread the tail end onto a yarn needle. Keeping your work folded in half, whipstitch down the long, side edge until you reach your thumb.Pass the needle through both of the edges of the piece.  Once the top part of your glove is long enough to reach your thumb, tie the yarn to itself. Weave the tail end back up the seam, then trim the excess off.  Place your hand against the glove, and note where your wrist is/the base of your thumb is. This will be about 5 inches (12 centimeters). Thread the bottom tail end of your work, and sew up the side of your glove using a whipstitch. Stop when you reach the wrist area/base of your thumb., When the glove is sewn together, you'll have a hole in the side seam for your thumb. If you are happy with the size of the hole, tie the yarn to itself. Weave the tail end back down a few inches/centimeters, then cut the excess off.  These gloves are reversible. There is no left or right glove, so you can measure the second glove against the same hand.	Cast on about 40 stitches. Knit every row until the glove is wide enough to wrap around your palm or forearm. Cast off, then tie the yarn off. Fold your work in half, lengthwise. Sew down the first 2 inches (5 centimeters) of so of your glove. Tie the tail off, then weave it back up the seam. Sew up the bottom edge of your glove. Tie the tail off and weave it down the seam. Repeat the process for the other glove.
Purchase these items:  a pair of brown tights, a brown long sleeved jersey, a pair of orange or yellow socks, or the legs cut from a pair or orange or yellow tights.; , Put on the brown tights and stuff polyester batting under them in the area of the hips and thighs. Safety pin through the tights to secure the batting in a few places. Remove the tights and baste or glue the batting in place. Remove the safety pins.  Cut long triangles of brown felt and sew them in layers to the top side of the arms of the t-shirt. Set it aside.  This is similar to a large, heart shaped throw pillow. Buy 3/4 yard of brown fleece. Cut 1/2 yard of it, double thickness into a large heart shape. Sew around all sides leaving a 6" opening to stuff it. Push fiberfill into the breastplate, getting more at the top.  Sew the opening shut and pin it to the front of the brown jersey. Tack it in place to the front of the t-shirt with basting stitches. Set remaining 1/4 yard of fleece aside.  The names of these parts are: the wattle, which hangs down from the neck. The snood, or a strip of red over the top of the bill or beak. The caruncle which goes over the head and upper neck. Use 1/2 yard of red fleece.  It comes folded, double thickness. Cut two 3" X 45" strips from the side of the fleece.  These long strips will stretch if you pull them. On the sewing machine, use a zig-zag stitch and go around each side of each strip, pulling slightly as you sew.  The fabric will fall into ruffles and they will make up the red parts on the turkey's head. Set these ruffles aside.  Cut out a circle for your face to show through. Put the hood on an assistant and drape the red ruffles to make up the hanging red parts on the turkey's head. Pin with safety pins to place the ruffles, remove the hood and tack the ruffles into place.  Remove the safety pins.  Use a standard, black marker to make parenthesis type marks around each eye.  Purchase a 6" wire, circular, wreath frame for $2.00 at the discount store, in the floral department. Attach a 3 foot piece of brown ribbon or strips of fabric, one on each side.  This lets you tie the frame securely around your waist.  For the longest layer, cut from brown tag board twenty 3" X 24" strips. Taper one end to a point with scissors. Use a yard stick to score a line down the center of each feather from top to bottom. Paint an inch of white at the ends of the feathers, using tempera paint. Follow with a black stripe beneath the white.  Taper, score and paint them as you did previously.  Crease each feather at the score mark slightly to give it dimension and insert each feather into the wire frame. Make a row, fanning them out at the top. At the wire base, they will overlap and begin to fit very snugly into the grid work of the frame. Repeat with the second layer. Tie the tail feathers around your waist and adjust them, fanning them out. Remove the tail piece, place it flat and squeeze a generous amount of white glue into the base of the of the feathers, beneath the wire of the frame. Turn the piece over and repeat, getting plenty of glue into the feather base. Allow this to dry overnight.  Paint an orange, triangular beak on your nose, having it go onto your cheeks. Outline this triangle with brown or black eyeliner pencil.  Cut triangles from felt and attach an elastic around to slip over your shoes and secure the shoe covers. Tie a piece of felt in the same color around your ankle and glue a triangle for the spur on the back of the foot.  Put on the brown tights and jersey. Pull on yellow socks or yellow legs cut from tights to form the leg. Put on the hood. With assistance, put on the tail and tie it securely around your waist. Have helper slip the shoe covers over your shoes. Have the assistant paint the beak over your nose and outline it. Have helpers check you over and arrange the wattles of red on your head, around your neck and draping over one shoulder, falling onto your chest. Fan out the tail feathers.	Gather clothing for the Basic Costume. Fatten up your thighs. Make the wings. Make a breast plate. Make the red parts for the head. Make a hood to cover your head.Cut a double thickness from the remaining  1/4 yard of brown fleece into the shape of a hood. Glue large, plastic "Googly Eyes" from the craft store onto the forehead of the hood, above your own eyes. Make the fan tail. Make two layers of tail feathers. For the second layer of feathers, repeat as above but make them slightly narrower and shorter, 2" X 22". Insert the feathers into the wire frame. Do the final touches. For feet, make gold shoe covers. On the big day, get dressed for fun.
Make sure it is not mushy and half decomposed. Look under succulent plants for fallen leaves. Wiggle and pull one off a plant if there are none on the ground.; ,  If using a container, the lid does not need to be used.   If the soil is already moist, add a little bit of water. If the soil is dry, make sure it is moist before planting. ,  Rainwater or tap water is good for watering.   If the planting container is in a spot with some sunlight, that's ok; just make sure the sunlight isn't too strong or the propagated succulent could get sunburned and die.  Spray the soil whenever it's dry., Succulents grow at their own pace, but some will root really quickly.  The roots are pinkish and like to stick out in many directions.  Sometimes succulents will grow a baby sprout before growing roots  Just wait until roots appear to plant. If you get a baby sprout first, that means that you are watering it just right.   Use the spray bottle to gently mist.   Eventually, the leaf that succulent grew from will die and fall off. Do not remove the lea; you can risk tearing off roots. Instead, wait for the leaf to fall off then remove. , The succulent is ready to transplant when:  The "mother leaf" or leaf the succulent grew from has fallen off. When you gently move the succulent is stays secure in the ground. The succulent has an elongated stem with a baby sprout on top.   It's ok to accidentally break roots; the succulent will grow more roots to replace.   Make sure the location is shady, for example under a succulent already growing. Cover the hole burying everything but still exposing the baby sprout.	Find a healthy succulent leaf. Find a cardboard tray, eggshell carton, a container to temporary use until the succulent is ready to be transplanted. Fill your planting container with soil.Place the succulent on top of the soil. Spray the soil around the succulent, and spray the end of the succulent that was torn off the plant. Find a good, location out of the sun for the planting container. Spray the end of the succulent that was torn off everyday. As soon as the succulent has grown roots, dig a shallow hole to fit the roots and plant the succulent. Don't act too soon. Continue to water everyday. If dead leaves appear, remove them to prevent mould.Make sure to water daily. Look out for signs of transplant readiness. Gently dig slightly under the succulent to avoid damaging roots. Dig a hole deep enough to cover the entire stem underground, and place the succulent in.
Not every type of houseplant has the same watering needs, so educate yourself on the plants you have or are thinking of buying. Don’t assume that every plant wants 1 quart of water every two days because all of your plants won’t thrive like that.Some may prefer to have their soil fairly dry most of the time, while others need it moist. Some may need the soil to dry out in between waterings.; , Although it may be easiest to water on a set routine that you have decided, plants are not likely to thrive when watered this way. So rather than watering every two days, get a feel for how often your plant needs water. Check the soil consistently and learn how often it tends to dry out and water on that schedule.Even indoor plants tend to have a dormant stage during the winter, so it is likely they will not need to be watered as often during this time. Morning tends to be a good time to water your plants. Watering at night can cause your plants to develop diseases more easily because the plant does not have time to dry before the temperature cools.  Stick a finger in the soil up to your first knuckle and notice if the soil is moist enough. If you finger can’t even enter the soil, it definitely needs to be watered. If you reach an inch or so deep but your finger is completely dry, it probably needs water. If the top inch feels fairly moist, and some of the dirt sticks to your finger, it probably has enough water.Again, this is not a guarantee for every plant. But most of the time if the top portion of soil is dried out, the plant could use some more water. You can buy a moisture meter that sticks in the soil and tells you when the plant needs water, which might be helpful and save guesswork.  Leaves can be a good indication of both under and overwatering. If the leaves seem to be hanging limp, this often means the plant needs water. If they are brown, dry, or some have fallen out, this usually means the plant needs water.These signs mean that something is very wrong. Do not wait until your plant develops these signs before you water them. If the plant is dried out, water it slowly. Giving it too much water all at once might kill it. These same signs can sometimes mean the plant has been overwatered, so use this in conjunction with checking the soil. If you know you just watered it that day, give the plant time to absorb and use that water before watering it again.  You can test if your plant has enough water by lifting it after you have just watered it and noticing how heavy it feels. Lift it periodically, and when it doesn’t feel heavy enough, you’ll know it needs some water. It’s more of an art than a science, but this can be good trick to master.This is only a good test for plants that are light enough to pick up and if you have the strength to do so. It’s not worth straining yourself just to check.  You might assume that water from your faucet is just fine, but you may be wrong. City water can have chlorine and fluoride which not all plants can handle. Soft water may have too much salt. Tap water may be too alkaline. If you use a certain water for awhile and it doesn’t seem to be keeping your plants healthy, it’s probably time to switch.If you can store a container outside to catch rainwater, this is a great option since it’s what the plants would get naturally. If you happen to live somewhere that has acid rain, this won’t work. Melted snow is also a good option if you live in colder climates with little rain. Bottled water can also be a good option, although this may be too costly. For city water, you can fill an open container and let the water sit for a day or so, which allows the chemicals to evaporate before you use it on your plants.  After each watering, refill your watering container and let it sit until the next time you water. This way, the water can warm up to a standard temperature rather than whatever temperature it would be from the tap or from rainwater. Most plants tend to prefer tepid water over cold water.If you have multiple plants and need a lot of water, consider keeping a few jugs, or watering cans, stored somewhere that you can keep filled and ready for when you need them.  You want to err on the side of giving you plants less than enough water, because you can easily add a little more. Once you water plants too much, it is a lot of work to fix it. Keep track of how much water you use from one time to the next so you can get an idea how much is the right amount.   Some plants can also benefit from misting the leaves, since watering mainly affects the roots. It is important to know your plant, however. Some leaves actually won’t benefit from misting, and some plants may even be harmed from getting their leaves wet.  If you do overwater your plant, and it isn’t draining, you can do a couple things to help stabilize it. Gently tip the pot on it’s side and allow the excess water to drain out for awhile. Or place paper towels on the surface of the soil and let them absorb some of the water. If it becomes a real problem, consider repotting in a new container that has better drainage. Try moving the pot to a warmer location so that it will dry more quickly. Avoid watering the plant for a while. Wait until the soil has dried out again.  Plants should be matched to a container of the right size to ensure that water is distributed efficiently. Plants in containers that are too small can become “root bound,” meaning the roots take up all the space. Plants in containers that are too big may not hold water in the soil and so will become dried out.If you check the roots and you can tell there is more root than soil, this is a good indication that it’s time to get a bigger pot. You only want to move plants up one pot size at a time so you don’t end up with too much extra room. If the leaves of the plant seem disproportionate in size to the bottom, you should move up a pot size. If the pot has ever tipped over because of being top heavy, this is a definite indication you need a bigger pot. As with many aspects of tending indoor plants, there is no hard and fast rule that always applies. You need to occasionally take stock of your plant and judge if you feel a bigger pot would benefit it.  Since overwatering is often what kills plants, pots that allow plants to drain are very important. These pots will either have a hole in the center of the bottom or may have some kind of thin slits on the bottom. Pots with a solid bottom can cause water to pool and the roots can rot if soaked for too long.If pots without drainage holes are your only option, it works well to put a layer of stones at the bottom of the pot. Extra water can pool there and won’t be in direct contact with the soil and roots. The stone layer should be an inch or so deep. Be extra careful not to overwater your plants. If you can only find plastic pots without holes, you can drill your own holes into the bottom.  If your pot is going to drain water, you most definitely don’t want it draining out onto your floors. You can purchase plastic pans specifically for this, or you can improvise and use a plate or saucer. You could even cut up a milk jug or 2 liter bottle if the pot is small enough and you aren’t overly concerned with the appearance of it.Always empty this drainage pan within a half hour or so after watering, rather than allowing the plant to sit in it. If you don’t drain the pan, it’s basically the same as having a pot with no holes, as the plant will still be soaking in too much water.  If you have had a plant for a while and you can tell it is growing bigger, it may be best to replant it in a bigger pot. If the soil of the plant has shrunk away from the edges, it may need a smaller pot. To check if a plant has become root bound, you can carefully pull it out of the pot and check if there is still plenty of soil or if it seems to be mostly roots.	Research your specific plants’ needs. Let the plant determine when you water it. Perform the finger test. Watch the leaves. Learn the weight of your well-watered plant. Pay attention to the type of water you use. Use room temperature water. Pour water evenly across the surface of the soil. Correct overwatering. Pot plants in properly sized containers. Place plants in a pot with drainage holes. Place a drainage pan under the pot. Repot when necessary.
There are many different juniper cultivars, each with a different appearance and size, so you'll need to choose one that suits your taste and space appropriately.Low growing varieties grow 2 feet (61 cm) high or less. Some examples are:  Sargentii, which has green foliage and spreads to 7 feet (2.1 m) Plumosa Compacta, which spreads to 8 feet (2.4 m) and has gray-green foliage in the summer and bronze-purple foliage in the winter Wiltoni or Blue Rug, which spreads to 8 feet (2.4 m) and has silver-blue foliage Shore juniper, which has yellow-green foliage and spreads to 8 feet (2.4 m)   Medium growing varieties reach heights between 2 and 5 feet (0.6 and 1.5 m). Several common cultivars include:  Sea Green, which has arching dark green foliage that spreads out as far as 8 feet (2.4 m) Saybrook Gold, which spreads to 6 feet (1.8 m) and has bright gold needle-like foliage Holbert, which has blue-tinted foliage that can spread as wide as 9 feet (2.7 m)   Large growing varieties tend to reach heights between 5 and 12 feet (1.5 and 3.7 m). A few example include:  Aureo-Pfitzerana, which has yellow-tinted light green foliage that spreads as far as 10 feet (3 m) Pfitzeriana, which has bright green foliage that spreads out to 10 feet (3 m) Blue vase, which has steel blue foliage that grows out to 5 feet (1.5 m)  ; , If you want to add juniper to your garden, you should buy young juniper plants from a local garden center.Juniper plants can be grown from seed or propagated through cuttings, but the process is time-consuming and difficult, so it is not recommended for the average gardener. It is also more difficult to find seeds and cuttings than it is to find a young established plant.  Junipers do best with full sun, but they can also survive well in partial shade.   Areas that are mostly shaded should be avoided. Junipers planted in the shade tend to open up and thin out. They may also face more problems with pests and diseases. You should also avoid sites that are directly next to lawn sprinklers or similar sources of irrigation. Heavy, frequent watering can drench the soil too severely for your juniper plant., Most juniper varieties tolerate a wide range of soil conditions, but the soil must be well-draining. If it isn't, you should amend the soil to improve its drainage abilities before planting your juniper.   The pH of the soil does not matter much for most varieties. Most varieties can manage well in dry, clay-based soils and standard soils. Some can even grow in sand or notably salty soils. If the soil is heavy and drains poorly, you should dig several buckets of gravel or grit into the intended planting area prior to the planting period. Either material should help improve drainage conditions. While it is not necessary, if you want to make the soil more nutrient-dense, you may also wish to add a bucket of organic material, like leaf mold, rotted manure, or compost. Dig it into the planting site shortly before you intend to plant the juniper.  Thoroughly water the juniper in its container, soaking the soil and making it more compact.Feel the soil in the container before you do this. If it already seems very moist and very compact, you should skip this step. Watering the soil reduces the amount of air in the container and makes it easier to remove the root ball.  Use a shovel or spade to dig a hole that is twice as wide and at least as deep as the container the juniper plant is currently in.   There needs to be plenty of space. If you make a hole that is just barely big enough, the roots may not settle and establish themselves well.  Mix 2 tsp (10 ml) of a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer into the soil for every 1 gallon (4 L) plant.   Note that a 10-10-10 fertilizer refers to a blend containing equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. You should either mix the fertilizer into the soil at the bottom of the hole or spread it around the outside of the hole. Do not lay the fertilizer directly inside the planting hole.  If the plant is in a disposable plastic container, carefully tip the container on its side and press around the outside to loosen the soil and root mass inside. You should be able to carefully slide the entire soil mass out of the container with your hands or shovel.   If the plant is not in a disposable plastic container, you may need to loosen the soil around the sides of the container by gliding your shovel around the inner perimeter.  Use your hands or a dull knife to separate the individual roots from the compacted mass. Loosen as many of the roots as possible without damaging too many.   You do not need to tease out all of the roots, but the longer ones at the bottom of the root ball should be loosened from the mass. This will help the roots spread into the surrounding soil as you plant the shrub.  Place the root ball in the center of the hole you dug. The top of the root ball should be level to the surface of the soil around the hole.   The soil level should be about the same as it was in the pot. If you discover that the planting hole is too deep, take the plant out and add more soil before putting it back in. If the hole is too shallow, remove the plant and dig the hole deeper before returning it.  Hold the shrub steady and upright while you fill in the hole around it with some of the soil you removed while digging the hole.   You can also add some organic matter during this time, but that is strictly optional. Pat down the soil with your hands or feet to settle it and remove any air pockets. Do not stamp the plant into the ground, however.  When junipers are planted too close together, a thick layer of foliage can form, causing problems with air circulation. As a result, the plants are more likely to face problems with pests and diseases.   This can be a problem for all juniper varieties, but it is especially problematic for horizontal growing varieties. The exact amount of space you need to leave in between juniper plants will vary based on the type and size of the variety you choose. Consider how far the shrub spreads and space the plants wide enough apart to prevent them from spreading into each other.  Give the plant plenty of water immediately after you finish planting it. Doing so will help the plant establish itself while further compacting the soil.   Continue to water the plant twice a week for the first month to help it establish itself.  Established juniper plants only need to be watered during periods of severe drought.   These plants are fairly drought tolerant, so you should be able to leave them alone during minor droughts. Junipers can actually weaken if you water them too often. Soggy soil and water-logged roots make the plant more susceptible to diseases and pests.  Fertilizer should be mixed into the soil around the junipers once in the early spring. Apply fertilizer once more in the late summer.   Use 1/2 lb (225 g) of fertilizer per 100 square feet (9.23 square meters). For best results, apply the fertilizer immediately before an anticipated rainfall. If this is not possible, water the area thoroughly after application. Select a 16-4-8 or 12-4-8 fertilizer. These two types have a large amount of nitrogen (represented by the "16" and "12"), which helps the juniper produce more chlorophyll to grow faster. The phosphorus ("4") is minimal since phosphorus primarily helps with flowering ability. The potassium ("8") is mid-range and helps protect the plant from disease while improving root development., You only need to prune old, dead foliage that builds up underneath creeping juniper varieties. Clearing out dead wood improves air circulation, leading the a healthier plant.   You can also prune the tips of the plant as they bud to limit the height and reach of the plant. If the plant becomes too bushy or dense, you can thin out some of the older wood, as well. Wait until new growth has begun to sprout in the spring before doing any pruning. Since the needles can be painful, you should wear gloves and long sleeves while pruning the plant. Do not do any heavy pruning, however. Not much new growth develops on old wood, so if you cut the wood back to its large limbs, that wood will not grow back and the plant will remain bare.  Junipers can develop problems with insects, including bagworms, spider mites, leaf miners, webworms, and aphids.   Most of these pests can be controlled with pesticide. Wait until you see a problem, then purchase a pesticide labeled for use against that pest and apply as directed on the label. If you see carrot-shaped bags forming on the needles of your juniper, you likely have a bagworm problem. You can physically remove these bags to prevent the larvae from hatching and eating the needles. Spruce spider mites can be especially problematic since they come in heavy infestations and cause massive needle browning and death. Chemical intervention is almost always necessary. Twig borers can be detected when branch tips brown and die. Webworms can be detected when you see heavy webbing and browning of the foliage. Both of these must be treated with pesticides, as well., Junipers planted in ideal conditions rarely have trouble with disease, but some diseases can occur, especially during particularly rainy or shady seasons.   Twig and tip blight can be avoided with proper air circulation, but if you notice it, you should quickly remove any infected branches.Apple cedar rust can develop when apples or crabapples are planted near junipers. If you see it, remove the infected portions of the plant immediately. Phytophthora root rot results in the sudden death of the entire plant and cannot be treated after it develops. It can be prevented by planting the juniper in raised beds or well-draining soil. Scale appears on stems and leaves and can be minimized by applying dormant oil in the spring or at first sight of a problem.	Choose the best variety. Purchase a small established shrub. Look for a sunny location. Examine and amend the soil. Water the juniper in its container. Dig a large hole. Mix in a balanced fertilizer. Remove the plant from the container. Loosen the root mass. Place the root ball into the hole. Fill in the rest of the hole. Leave plenty of space in between plants. Water thoroughly until established. Avoid over-watering. Apply fertilizer twice a year. Prune lightly. Watch out for common pests. Be aware of common diseases.
While hardware mixers and synths are often used by pros, software alternatives are considerably less expensive and an increasing number of professional producers use software. A digital audio workstation (DAW) will be used for much of the process, so finding a good one can be key. Some of the more popular DAWs include Ableton Live, Cubase, and FL Studio. In addition, you may want software (or hardware) synthesizers. Some popular soft synths include Massive and Sylenth1. Finally, sample packs can help since drums are often difficult to synthesize. You might try the packs from Vengeance, although there are plenty of free packs online.   If you can't afford synths, you may be able to find some free online. Many DAWs will come with soft synths too. Listen to music using DAWs, vsts, or sample packs you're considering buying. If the software is popular, it shouldn't be too hard to find. Be sure your computer is reasonably up to date, or it may not run your software. A good soundcard, as well as good headphones help too.; , Make sure you understand the interface, not just of your DAW, but your vsts too. There are lots of tutorials are on youtube for more popular software, and the website for your software may have information too.   Don't be afraid to follow tutorials outside your genre. A little work in funk or dubstep will only help you understand your software all the better.  You don't have to start with drums, but many producers may choose to start with them. Your bpm should be about 120-130 depending on subgenre, although some may by slightly outside these speeds. Take your kick drum and place it on every quarter note of a 1 bar loop. Then your snare should be on the offbeat (skip the 1st quarter, play the 2nd, etc.) An open hat should be between each quarter, and closed hats can play 16ths for speed.   While this forms a nice basic beat, you may want to add extra elements. Toms or random percussion effects would be more common, although it is your song. If you would prefer an unusual instrument, go for it! You may want to create separate patterns for each instrument. That way you can build and remove elements throughout the song.  In house, loops may often last 8 bars. Set your 1 bar drum loops to repeat for 8 bars. If you would rather not use 8, loops lasting 16 or maybe 32 bars are sometimes used. Shorter loops are used too, although they may sound overly repetitive.   These lengths are used to make transitioning songs easier on the DJ.  Synth chords, vocals, and synth basses are some of the more common elements, although as long as the loops sound good together, anything goes. Don't worry about it sounding too intense too early in the song. This isn't actually how your song will begin, but if the loops played together blend well, the track will sound more cohesive.   Don't be afraid to blend real with electronic. If done well, it can add more depth to your tracks.  Take the different patterns and work in units of 8 bars (more or less if you choose) to create your track. you might start with your synth pad, add the kick after the first 8, bring in the snare next, etc. You can remove elements too of course, or add more than 1 element at once.   Many house tracks start with a "drum intro." This is where you gradually introduce your drum patterns before playing the melodic (or harmonic) elements. Units of 8 bars often group to form larger sections of 32. You might have a 32 bar drum intro, a 32 bar breakdown, then a 32 bar "drop," etc.  Filtering in your leads, or using a downlifter that came with one of your sample packs will work, but there are many different transitions. Try listening to some of your favorite tracks and see how they transition.   Wind effects are good for transitions and not nearly as difficult to synthesize as drums. You could try make some yourself instead of sampling. That way you have more control over the sound.  It can be a complex process, but it will greatly improve your results. You can always find someone to master it for you, or learn yourself. Try to find guides online.  Youtube or Soundcloud are great for posting music. Although, if you used any copyrighted material, be sure to give credit where due.   Even if you don't want to sell your music, download links from Mediafire or similar file storing sites can be nice. It'll be easier for your friends to get a hold of it. If you do want to sell it, you may not need a label. Bandcamp, TuneCore, or CD Baby make self publishing very easy.	Get the equipment. Take some time to learn the software. Start your track with the drums. Decide your loop length. Begin layering elements over your beat. Structure your track. Add the transitional elements. Master your music. Post your track online.
This may sound obvious, but it's likely that part of the reason you're having stage fright is because you're worried that everyone will think you're boring. Well, you may be worried about being boring because your material is boring. Even if you're speaking or presenting very dry material, think of ways to make it more accessible and engaging. You'll be less worried about presenting if you know that your content will be engaging.If it's appropriate, make some room for laughter. Throw in a few jokes that will ease your tension and relax the audience.  As you create and practice your presentation, consider the needs, knowledge, and expectations of audience. If you're speaking to a younger audience, adjust your content, voice, and speech as necessary. If it's an older and more stern audience, be more practical and logical. You'll be less nervous if you know that you'll actually be able to reach the people who are listening to you.  Don't show up on stage and make a little joke about being nervous. Everyone will assume that you're confident just because you're already up there. Announcing that you're nervous may make you feel better, but the audience will lose faith in you instead of paying attention.  Videotape yourself as you give your presentation. Keep presenting and taping until you can look at the recording and think, "Wow, that's a great presentation!" If you're not happy with how you look on tape, then you won't be pleased with how you appear in person. Keep doing this until you get it right. When you're up on stage, just remember how great you looked in the video, and tell yourself that you can do even better.  You can blow off some nervous energy and reach your audience by pacing back and forth across the stage. If you move around with energy and gesture for emphasis, you'll be overcoming your stage fright just by moving. But don't fidget by moving your hands together, playing with your hair, or fiddling with your microphone or speech or presentation notes.   Fidgeting will only build tension and will make your audience see that you're uncomfortable.  Most public speakers manifest their stage fright by talking way too fast. You may be speaking fast because you're nervous and want to get the speech or presentation over with, but this will actually make it harder for you to articulate your ideas or to reach your audience. Most people who talk too fast don't even realize that they're doing it, so remember to pause for a second after every new thought, and to leave room for your audience to react to important statements.   Slowing down will also make you less likely to stumble over your words or misspeak. Time your presentation beforehand. Get used to the pace that you need to finish your presentation at the appropriate time. Keep a watch handy and glance at it from time to time to make sure you're on track.  If you really want to improve your stage fright, you should ask your audience how you did by asking for feedback afterwards, handing out surveys, or asking colleagues in the audience to give their honest opinion. Knowing what you did well will build your confidence, and knowing how you can improve will help you feel more confident the next time you get on stage.	Make it interesting. Consider your audience. Don't tell people you're nervous. Record yourself. Move around, but don't fidget. Slow down. Ask how you did.
By matching the color of your closet door to other room tones, you'll give the room a coordinated feel.   The color wheel: All colors are based on the 3 primary colors: red, yellow and blue. Secondary colors are created by mixing 2 primaries together. (Red and blue make purple. Blue and yellow produce green. Yellow and red make orange.) The 6 tertiaries are created by combining a secondary color with its neighboring primary. The 12 colors make up the standard color wheel. Monochromatic schemes: Colors from the same family naturally complement each other. Different shades of a single color can make excellent accents when you paint closet doors. Cool tones: Colors with a blue base are considered "cool." These calming tones are often used in bedroom. Colors derived from red are "warm" colors. These colors may be better suited for a family-room closet door. Muted colors: Select subdued tones for bedroom closet doors. This gives the room a soothing quality, making it easier for you to relax. In other rooms, a muted color on a closet door won't detract from the focal point of the room. Neutral hues: Browns, grays and creams are neutral colors. Generally, the less saturated the intensity of the color, the more neutral it becomes. These colors mix well with others, and can allow you to change the feel of the room with the change in seasons.; , Certain steps must be taken to make sure your paint job looks professional and lasts.   If possible, take the door off its hinges and set it on 2 sawhorses. This makes painting the top and bottom of the door easier. If you can't remove the door, you can paint it as is. Gently sand the door with 120-grit paper. This prepares the surface for paint, making it adhere to the door better. Don't completely take off the existing finish. After you sand the door, wash the door with a diluted detergent solution. Wipe the door down with a damp cloth and let the surface dry thoroughly. Protect doorknobs or other hardware. Either remove the metal fixtures from the door before you start painting or cover them with painter's masking tape. Consider using a wet-edge extender additive to latex paint. This keeps the paint from drying too quickly as you work on the different sections of the door. Determine whether you need to give the door a primer coat. If the door is bare or stained wood, if it currently is a dark color and you want to make it a lighter shade, or it was painted in oil and you want to use a latex paint, you will need to use a primer.  Most closet doors are flat, and therefore, relatively easy to paint. But some doors, particularly those in walk-in closets, have multiple panels that require a special painting technique. For intricate doors, following a painting pattern can produce high-quality results.   Paint the panels first. Use a small roller to cover most of the panel surfaces. Use a brush to touch up. Be sure to paint along the wood grain. This highlights the grain and gives a cleaner look. Paint the center, vertical stile of the door that runs between the panels. Use a roller to cover this area quickly. Paint vertically. Paint the horizontal rails in the middle of the door. Paint these sections horizontally with a roller. Paint the 2 outside stiles vertically, from top to bottom. Paint the header and footer panels between the outside stiles and the panels. These sections should be painted horizontally using a brush or roller. Apply a thin film of paint along the edge of the door with a roller. Spread it evenly using a brush. Let the door dry completely before adding a second coat. On flat doors, use a roller to speed the process. Apply paint evenly, taking care to ensure that you don't leave roller lines on the surface. Paint the other side of the door.	Learn how to select a color that complements the room. Prepare your closet door for painting. Paint your closet door.
Planting stem cuttings is one of the most popular ways to propagate roses. The best time to take and plant cuttings is when the temperature outside is warm but not too hot. The ideal time of year for this is late spring or early summer.   It is possible to grow roses from cuttings when the weather is colder, but the process will take longer and your chances of success will be lower.If you don’t have a rose bush of your own that you can use for a cutting, ask a friend or neighbour if they have a plant you can use. You may also be able to find wild rose bushes that you can propagate. You can also ask a local nursery or garden center if they let people take cuttings from any of their plants.; , To propagate roses using this method, you need to select a healthy rose plant and cut off a stem. For this project, you will need some gardening, cutting, and potting tools, including:   Clean two-inch (five-cm) pot Potting soil Sharp sterilized cutting tool Rooting hormone Clear plastic bag or mason jar  , Fill the small pot with potting soil. For the best results, replace a quarter of the soil with perlite, peat moss, or vermiculite, or a combination thereof. This will increase air flow and draining, giving your cutting a better opportunity to root.If the soil is dry, water it and allow the excess water to drain out, so that the soil is evenly moist.   Instead of a pot, you can also use a small mason jar or the bottom half of a large plastic bottle (cut the top off).  Choose a healthy and established plant to take a cutting from. The stem should come from the top and side of the plant, and it should have at least three leaves on it. Ideally, find a stem that has flowered recently. Look for a stem that’s young but established and hardy, and that’s about six inches (15 cm) long.   It’s better to take cuttings from the top and side of the plant because they seem to root better than cuttings from the middle or bottom.It’s ok if the stem you select has buds and flowers currently on it, but look for a stem with flowers that are starting to wither. This indicates the stem recently bloomed.  The best tool for taking the cutting is a pair of sharp pruning sheers or a razor blade. Cut the stem from the plant at a 45-degree angle, just below one of the lower leaf nodes (where the leaf attaches to the stem).Make sure the cutting tool has been sterilized to prevent the spread of disease. To sterilize your cutting tool, you can heat it with fire until it’s red hot, or boil it in water for 30 minutes.  With the same cutting tool, cut off any withered flowers and new buds where they attach to the stem. If any hips (fruit) have started to form, cut these off as well.Cut off any leaves on the lower half of the stem. Leave two to three higher leaves to help with photosynthesis.  Wounding is the process of making slits in the bottom of the stem, and this will encourage rooting. With the same cutting tool, cut one-inch (2.5-cm) slits in the bark at the bottom of the stem.   Make three or four slits in the bark to give the roots more places to grow out from., Insert the bottom two inches (five cm) of the cutting so that the cutting, wounds, and bottom of the stem are covered in the hormone.Rooting hormone is not a necessary step in the cutting and propagating process, but it will increase the chances that your cutting will grow successfully.  With the tip of your finger or a pencil, make a two-inch (five-cm) hole in the potting soil at the center of the pot. Place the cut end of the stem in the hole. Pack the soil around the stem and use your hands to firm the soil in place.   Water the soil so that it’s thoroughly moist., To cover the stem with plastic, insert two eight-inch (20-cm) sticks or wires into the soil on either side of the stem to prop up the plastic. Cover the pot and stem with a clear plastic bag, and affix the bag to the pot with an elastic or twine. With a mason jar, simply place a large mason jar over the stem.   Covering the stem with glass or plastic will create a miniature greenhouse, and the cover will help keep in the heat, moisture, and ultraviolet rays the stem needs to root and grow., Throughout each day, the plant will need plenty of bright sunlight. But to avoid overheating, place the plant in a bright location that receives lots of indirect sunlight, especially around midday.The mason jar or plastic will help to keep the soil and cutting moist, but add more water any time the cutting or soil starts to dry out.	Select the right time. Gather your tools. Prepare a pot. Select a stem for the cutting. Cut off a section of stem. Remove flowers, buds, and some leaves. Wound the cutting. Dip the cutting in rooting hormone. Plant and water the cutting. Cover the stem with plastic or a mason jar. Provide the cutting with plenty of sunlight and moisture as it grows.
This is the step where we tell you to make sure you are legally allowed to dig your bunker. If you excavate illegally and someone finds out, you will face a fine and have to fill it in, or your council will fill it in and charge you for the privilege.; , The below stages are listed in order that they occur, but each stage needs to be considered before the project is started.  Digging a bunker under a home has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include that the entrance to the bunker can be concealed, and it is easier to supply electricity, etc.   Disadvantages are many. Messing with the foundations of a house can be disastrous. Access will likely be poor, perhaps preventing heavy machinery which will make things slow and difficult.       Excavated soil may be more difficult to remove, or may create a messy trail through your home.       You may have to dig through a concrete floor, which requires heavy equipment which will need to be rented. Pockets of natural gas, radiation, and mold all may be encountered during the construction of the bunker, and this is not ideal with your home is directly above. You do not want to poison your family as they sleep, or cause the whole house to blow up as methane escapes. Damp and mold are also unwelcome.       Generally, it's better to choose a site distant from any building. The best place is away from any trees, as their roots will make things harder.  Soil type also needs to be considered. Sandy soil is more prone to cave in. Clay is less likely to collapse. Rocky soil is difficult to dig out.  Depending upon where you are in the world, you may have to think about what effect cold weather will have on the ground. When the ground freezes and thaws, the soil expands and contracts. This may lead to collapse.  Ideally, you want to know what is beneath your feet before you start. Will you hit bedrock straight away? Where is the water table? You do not want to return the next day to your site to find it flooded. Do your research, know your soil.   The site also needs not to interfere with any underground cables, pipes, etc. This is another reason to build away from structures. Seriously consider getting a professional involved to advise you about a site.  You can use a backhoe or excavator to excavate out a large hole, then place or build a structure inside the hole, and then finally use the excavator to bury the structure again. Mini backhoes can be hired if you want to do it yourself, or the larger ones can be hired with an operator (e.g. for the day).   Dig down as far as you want, and keep the excavated soil close by, but far enough away from the hole so that it does not fall back in. Remember the pile of dirt will become very large very quickly. Soil in the ground is compacted, and when it is dug up it occupies more space.       When you have dug as deep as you require, make sure the surface is level. It is easiest to place a manufactured structure in the hole, and a shipping crate is a readily available and passable for this purpose. They are not too expensive, but you may be surprised how much they cost, even old ones. However, it will need to be lowered into the hole, and this will require more heavy machinery.       An alternative is to build your own structure in the hole. The floor needs to go down first. Take a while to plan the materials at this stage, it can mean the difference between damp and moldy and comfort. Cemented bricks or concrete blocks are a cheap and strong material for the walls. Using wood for the structure is not desirable, they will rot if you use untreated wood, and treated wood releases toxic chemicals that are unsuitable for an underground bunker. Wood is also less permanent and less strong than brickwork or cement blocks.  The second, slower and more dangerous method is to dig out the bunker from the entrance and shore up the tunnels as you go. This is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing. Try to always have a phone, (call for help if you survive and are then trapped by a cave in), and a light. Leaving an emergency shovel and water to hand may save your life.   This kind of digging can be a nightmare and can be very slow. It is also much more likely to lead to collapse. The ideal plan for this kind of bunker is a large circle shape. If one part collapses you can still get out round the other side. You need to take great care with how you shore up the walls and roof, with planks at first, but ideally solid brickwork.       Scaffolding poles can be used to prop up the ceiling, but this approach should not be trusted to secure larger rooms, only passageways. Use brick pillars instead of scaffolding poles for a more permanent measure.       If you hit solid rock, you should have chosen a better site. You need heavy equipment to break it up, or you can drill a hole and place explosives and then try to blast it out bit by bit (not recommended). You can hammer wooden wedges into cracks to try to break pieces off. If you live somewhere cold, try pouring water into the cracks and then leaving it overnight. The water expands when it freezes and may break pieces off.    Water-proofing the bunker. A simple plastic sheeting laid below the floor, and similar measures for the walls and roof may be needed to prevent water and damp seeping in.       Sound-proofing of the roof and walls. This way your bunker will remain undiscovered even if loud music is playing and it is near the surface. You do not want to live in fear and have to whisper.       Concealing and securing the entrance. This is more difficult if the bunker is in the middle of open ground. Consider planting quick-growing trees or landscaping the ground around to look natural. Another idea is to make the entrance look like a manhole cover. Another option is building a shed or other small structure on top of the entrance. An entrance is much more easily hidden inside a building, below the floor.       Power. A generator, or electric supply from the surface. Ventilation. In deeper installations, air needs to be circulated with vents and fans. Do your research.       Water supply and lavatory. Main water supply may be interrupted during a disaster. Look into rainwater collectors and water purifiers. To have a sustainable toilet within the bunker, a septic tank and leach field will be needed, but the tank needs to be emptied and the leach field rested at intervals (years). Another option is the composting toilet.	Check the legal and zoning requirements. Plan and research every aspect in great detail. Think carefully before committing to a bunker under your home. Consider soil. Plan for the cold. Get to know your landscape. Consider using heavy machinery. Go without machinery if desired. Consider other finishing touches and safety measures.
This dance is done with a partner, so you need to find someone to dance with. Your partner, boyfriend, or girlfriend is a great choice, but if you're single, ask someone at the club to dance with you.While this dance isn't always done with a partner, it often is.; , Yiking isn't exactly a hands off dance, so if you're going to yike with someone, make sure it's someone you don't mind getting up close and personal with. It involves some grinding and touching of each other's bodies, so make sure you're comfortable with that., If you know what twerking is (moving your butt up and down to the beat), yiking takes it to the next level. Partially, it's more intense because it involves a partner, but you also include more movement (side-to-side)., Start by bending over a bit and sticking your butt out. You can place your hands on your knees if that helps. Also, try to arch your back a bit so your butt sticks out. Your legs should be about shoulder-width apart.With a partner, your butt should basically be up against the other person's front.  Once you get in position, it's time to swing your hips to the beat. Lift your right leg up and step out a bit, though don't actually move over. Swing your hip to follow your leg, with your butt swinging out. Next, swing your left hip out, though don't step this time. Just move your hip and butt out to the left.Your butt should follow your hip, not lead., Once you've swung right and left (to the beat), move your butt back to the center. Make a wave with your body. Dip your head down and bring it up. As you move, bring the wave along your back and up through your butt. The final point of the move is bringing your butt up., If the music goes faster, you may not be able to dip fast enough to stay in time with the beat. If that's the case, you can change to the tic toc. With your butt still out and in the center, shift your weight back and forth by bringing each knee slightly forward in turn. That will shift your butt back and forth behind you.Don't step forward, just shift your weight.  As you're swaying, you can also bring it down to the floor. You want to keep your butt in the air, but you'll have your knees almost all the way to the ground (not on the ground) and your hands on the ground. Keep swaying your butt back and forth.Either person can do this move!  , To move to a yike stand, you need to have your forearms on the floor. However, instead of your knees close to the floor, you'll keep your legs straight, lifting your butt into the air towards your partner. You'll continue to sway in time to the beat.You should pivot on the balls of your feet to move back and forth.  To be on the back end of the yike, you start out with your legs apart, about shoulder-width. With your hands out in front of you, hold on to the other person's waist, at least to begin with., Step out with your right leg, but don't move outward. You're basically stepping into the same place. Follow your hip with your butt. You should be leaning into the person in front of you, not sticking your butt out as much., When your partner dips, dip your hips into it as well. You want to stay connected with your partner through the whole dance. When your partner tic tocs, you don't need to tic toc at the same time, but you should still have your hands on the person's hips or butt to move along with them.You can also add your own moves while your partner is dipping, such as dipping your shoulders or bringing a leg up.  When your partner goes into the yike stand, the person's legs should go between yours. You should have your legs spread out over your partner, moving your hips along with theirs. Keep your hands on their hip so that you can help keep both of you moving together.	Find someone to dance with. Pick someone you don't mind getting personal with. Be ready to step up from twerking. Stick your butt out. Sway to the beat. Come back to the middle. Try the tic toc. Bring it down to the floor. Get into a yike stand. Get in the starting position. Sway with your partner. Move in time with your partner. Stand over your partner in the yike stand.
If you do not have a case for storage, put them in a small pouch in your handbag or backpack so they can stay secured. Next time you use them, the cord will be wrapped rather than tangled.         Grab each of the ends. Starting from the earbuds, wrap your headphones around three of your fingers if you have larger hands, or four fingers if you have smaller hands. Stop wrapping when there is 3 inches (7.62 cm) left. Take out the wrapped part carefully, making sure that it doesn't come apart.Wrap the remaining length of cord around the middle of the headphones. There should be enough cord left to wrap it around the headphones at least twice.Tuck the end in. Once the entire cord has been wrapped around the headphones and you run out of cord to wrap, tuck the end of the cord into the part that’s already wrapped around. Check that it's secured tightly enough.; , Take a small object, such as a pencil, a hairbrush, or a candle holder, and wrap the cord carefully around. This will hold the headphones in place so that they won’t tangle when not in use.         Tuck the end of the cord into the final loop while wrapping the cord around your object. This will secure the cord and will also allow for easy removal from the object.  Find a small jar or a prescription bottle, and place your wrapped cord into the container. This way, the headphone cords will be unable to tangle since the small space will keep them in place.	Store your headphones in a small case. Wrap the headphones around an object. Store your headphones in a small container.
This entails confirming the following:The HDMI cable is hooked up to both the Apple TV box and your TV (or your receiver if you have one).

Skate parks are pretty all inclusive, and most welcome scooter riders as well as skateboarders or BMX riders. There are also some parks made specifically for scooter riders.Look for a park near you, then pick out some ramps to practice getting some air. Once in the air, you can use “flair moves”, or tricks that you do in the air while before landing.  Ride up the ramp or the bowl, making sure you’ve got enough speed built up. Once you hit the coping, or the metal railing around the lip of the ramp, jump. Jump as you normally would, putting both feet on the deck and jumping straight up. You’ll be in the air, ready to try some tricks.  Once you’re in the air, twist the handlebar so that your left handle is on the right side and the right handle is on the left side. Keep holding onto the handlebars, and your arms will create an “X”. Make sure to turn the handlebars back before you land., While in the air, let go of one handlebar and use your free hand to grab the opposite handlebar. Begin to spin the handlebars all the way around. Use your other hand to reach around and grab the handlebar you first let go of. Return the handlebars all the way around to their starting position., The tail grab is a trick borrowed from skateboarders, and it looks just as cool on a scooter. Once you’re in the air, bend slightly at the knees, then take one hand off the handlebars. Use that hand to grab the back of your deck. Hold on for as long as you can, then let go before landing.	Try riding some ramps. Use the ramp to get some air. Try “The X-Up”. Try the Barspin. Do a Tail Grab.
Choose a shoe with a flexible, thin sole for the dance floor. Stay away from platform shoes; that thick sole and heel make it difficult to feel the floor. Be sure, too, that your feet feel secure in you shoes. Backless sandals are best left at home. Do not wear sneakers or other shoes with rubbery or sticky soles or be prepared to pick up your feet. At best, you'll risk looking a bit herky-jerky in your movements; at worst you may find yourself with a twisted ankle or tweaked-out knee.  Tight satin might look (and feel) great, but it could inhibit your moves on the dance floor, and one wrong move could leave you with an embarrassing rip. Stay away, too, from tops or shirts that fit low in the armhole; they make it harder to move. Try on your outfit at home to be sure you can dance with ease.  If you tend to perspire, choose garments made of natural fibers. Tank tops and halter tops can look great, but sweaty or clammy skin could be a turn off if a partner asks you to dance. Drop a pack of moist towelettes and a travel-size powder in your pocket so you can freshen up when needed.	Put on your boogie shoes. Make sure you can move. Be prepared for the heat.
Deciding to start learning to play an instrument can be as simple as picking one up at a store or a friend's house and making a few notes. You might not be making music yet, but try to get your hands on an instrument and get a feel for it in your hands before committing to buy one or signing up for lessons.  a  Typically, if you want to sign up for band or orchestra at your school, call-outs are regularly held during which the directors allow you to experiment with instruments and select one. Go to one of these call-outs and check out all the different kinds of instruments. Most instrument stores are excited to share their instruments with you and let you give them a shot. They might even be able to show you a few things.; , One of the most common instruments to start out on, used in many different styles and regions, is the piano. From children to adults, the piano is an extraordinarily popular instrument to play and learn. Because you can actually see the notes in front of you, the piano is also a good instrument to build your knowledge of how music works, and your music-reading. Once you've learned the piano, you can also specialize in:   Organ Accordion Synthesizer Harpsichord Harmonium.  Other than the piano, the most popular instrument from Hank to Hendrix is the guitar. Technically a classical stringed instrument, the popular electric guitar put the instrument into pop culture like no other instrument. It's fun for rock and roll, jazz, and almost any kind of music. Guitar also provides a good foundation for different kinds of folk or rock instruments:   Bass guitar Mandolin Banjo Harp  Dulcimer.  If you want to play in an orchestra, a string quartet, or have a particular interest in classical music, a stringed instrument might be right for you.These instruments are also commonly used for folk music and other acoustic sounds. You might consider the following instruments:   Violin Viola Cello  Double bass (also known as the upright bass).  Brass instruments are so-called because they are traditionally extremely long metal tubes, bent in intricate patterns, featuring valves or keys to change the pitch, and made entirely of brass. Now they're generally made of different metals, but still work by vibrating your lips inside a metal mouthpiece. They're used in concert bands, jazz, marching bands, and many other types of music. Brass instruments include:   Trumpet Trombone Tuba French horn Baritone  Sousaphone.  Like brass instruments, woodwinds are played with the power of the breath. While brass instruments use mouthpieces to blow through and vibrate your lips, however, woodwinds use reeds that vibrate themselves when you blow over them. They're made of many different combinations of metals, woods, and reeds, and no orchestra or jazz combo is complete without them. Woodwind instruments include:    Flute, piccolo, or fife Saxophone Clarinet Oboe Bassoon  , Holding down the bottom-end of most music groups are the percussionists. In rock bands and jazz combos, the drummer typically plays a drum kit, made of several drums organized at once to play simultaneously with sticks and pedals. In orchestras and concert bands, percussionists perform a quite large variety of instruments that are played by striking them with hands, mallets, or sticks. Percussion instruments include:   The drum set  vibraphone, Marimba, and xylophone  Glockenspiel  bells and Cymbals   Congas and bongos  Tympani Woodblocks, cowbells, and triangles.  There are literally thousands of instruments you could take up and hundreds of teachers who offer lessons. Explore the world of music and listen for things you like and you might enjoy playing. Some difficult-to-categorize instruments:   Harmonica Djembe Concertina Bagpipes Singing bowls Ukulele Mbira Sitar.  You want to make sure you end up with both an instrument that works for your size and your hands, as well as an appropriate size of that instrument for you. Long and slender fingers are desirable for string instruments, while some brass instruments are somewhat heavy and require the strength and lung-capacity necessary to play them.   Some instruments, like violin and guitar, are available in lots of different sizes that can be customizable for your abilities and your size. Child-sizes are common. Look into your options, and get something in your budget that feels comfortable. Talk to the employees at the instrument store to get a sense of appropriate sizes and models. Some band directors try to steer people away from particular instruments like trumpet or saxophone because they're very popular. Pursue the instrument you want to play. There are one-handed guitarists and petite tuba players.  You can very quickly develop bad habits by playing your instrument without the right posture, or by playing it out of tune. You need to develop the proper technique with your particular instrument, holding it, sitting right, and blowing or striking the strings in the correct position.   Have your band director, teacher, or music store employee to give you a tutorial on the proper technique for your instrument. If you don't have access to teachers, videos and diagrams online are excellent resources for technique. Spend time tuning every time you sit down to play. Even unexpected instruments like the trombone need tuned, or you'll develop the wrong positioning on the slide when you're trying to hit the notes.  Though it can be a bit like learning a new language, learning how to read music will expand your musical horizons considerably. You can learn any song just by looking at the sheet music, noting the melody, the rhythm, and even the feeling of the music in the page directions. It's an invaluable tool for students of any instrument.   Make sure you learn to read bass clef if you're learning bass guitar or low brass instruments like trombone, baritone, and tuba.  Learn and practice playing scales. On all instruments, playing scales will help you improve faster technically and help you become more familiar with the correct notes, building your muscle memory toward them. As you progress, consider learning a little theory. Knowledge of simple chords and scales will broaden your musical imagination, you can do a great deal with a just a little. Ask a friend to show you, or find an online resource. Learn these basic structures at a comfortable pace, and you'll soon be tackling more advanced ideas.  The difference between learning an instrument and giving it up is practice. Develop a practice routine and commit to it. Practice at least 30 minutes a day, every day, to develop the right consistent habits and learn to play the instrument like it deserves to be played.  https://www.wikihow.com/Learn-to-Play-an-Instrument  Consider taking private lessons. Instructional books and YouTube videos can only take you so far, especially with instruments like the violin or wind instruments. Suzuki method classes spend a great deal of time (sometimes years) playing on fake violin-shaped instruments to get the correct bowing technique. Having one-on-one attention is invaluable when you're trying to learn an instrument. Make it easy to practice. Find a nice place in the house for your instrument. Store it where you spend your leisure time, or someplace where you're going to see it often during your day. The more accessible your instrument, the more you will pick it up and play it. Eventually you'll be picking it up every free minute you have.  It's very important to always practice playing in time. One of the signs of a novice player is that they often will play the notes as quickly as they are able, rather than playing them appropriately. When you learn the difference between playing in 4/4 time and waltz, when you learn the difference between quarter notes and whole notes, these things will be more clear, but it's critical to play according to the rhythm of the song that you're learning to play. Even if you're practicing scales, play in time.   Find a beat off of which to work: there are free metronomes online. A ticking clock or the radio will function well for you too.  It's no fun to play a trombone with a sticky slide, a sax with old reeds, or a guitar with gnarly green strings. Learn how to take care of your instrument, taking the time to clean, maintain, and respect it for the piece of art that it is. You won't develop bad habits in your technique and you'll get more life out of your instrument, not to mention a cleaner and more true sound. Take a few minutes before and after every practice session to take care of your instrument and do it right.  If you're in school, consider joining the orchestra or the concert band to take advantage of the lessons and the training that it has to offer. Even if your eventual goal is to become a rock drummer, the fundamentals offered in school band are quite valuable, not to mention that you have access to the school's instrumental resources, practice spaces, and teachers. They're usually sympathetic to your music goals, as well. Sign up!  , If you're trying to learn an instrument on your own, start playing with other people to learn as much as you can about playing in a group, playing with the right technique, and developing good habits. Aside from all you'll learn, it's also a whole lot more fun than playing scales in your bedroom. Try meeting other players at:   Music festivals Open-mic nights Fiddlers' jams Guitar shops.  Music is more than notes. No matter how boring a piece, even if it's like a nursery rhyme or a march, learn to inject feeling into the music and play it with your heart and soul. If you're finding this hard, imagine you're telling a story with the music and actually say an appropriate story in your head. Really listen to the music that you're playing and learn to give it color and character. Make it come alive.  Learning to play on the fly will make you a better all-around player. One part scales and one part creativity, playing extemporaneously means that you're learning the "language" of music. You're one step closer to speaking it fluently.   Start sight-reading sheet music when you get comfortable with your instrument. Rather than playing the Darth Vader theme one more time on your tuba, try learning something else and seeing if you can play it right the first time. Stick with it until you've got it just as much as the Imperial March.  Learning to play an instrument takes years of practice. It won't happen overnight. If you want to be good, commit to your instrument. Jimi Hendrix used to sleep with his guitar and some expert players are even buried with their horns, violas, and drumsticks. Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, a Hindustani classical musician, once famously said: "If you practice for ten years, you may begin to please yourself. After 20 years, you may become a performer and please the audience. After 30 years, you may please even your guru, but you must practice for many more years before you finally become a true artist—then you may please even God."	Experiment with many instruments before committing to one. Try out the classic piano. Think about rocking out on guitar. Consider orchestral stringed instruments. Try your hand at the brass family. Check out the woodwinds. Bang on some percussion. Consider other varieties of instrument. Get the correct size of instrument. Learn to hold and tune your instrument properly. Learn to read music notation. Practice constantly. Get rhythm. Take care of your instrument. Join a band. Start your own band. Play the music passionately. Improvise. Commit to the long haul.
Some typical problems are these:   Slow sink or tub drains. Water backing up in the bathtub, shower, or sink. Wet areas in walls or along floors in rooms adjacent to walls containing drain pipes. Wet areas in the lawn near drain piping. Unusual gurgling or bubbling sounds when water is draining.  If it is isolated to only one sink or other fixture, it is probably localised to the individual pipe that connects that fixture to the main line. In other words, if only the kitchen sink drains slowly, the problem is in the sink trap or drain line that connects to the larger pipes which additionally carries water from other sinks, the commode, and the bathtub.  Many times, the individual drain pipes are routed though the wall cavity, interconnecting to other pipes, which then go below the floor and exit the home to either the septic system or sanitary sewer.  For a bathroom or kitchen sink, this can be done by stopping the drain and filling the sink with hot water from the faucet. Unstop the plug, and the water will drain into the material which is clogging the pipes, and it the material is a residue of grease or grease like waste, the hot water may dissolve it sufficiently to flush enough of it out the pipes to restore your flow.   If necessary, use a drain cleaning product containing chemicals to dislodge or dissolve the material that is causing the stoppage. Drano or Liquid -Plumr are examples of chemical products that may dissolve hair, soap residue, grease, or other materials which can clog a drain line. Be careful if you choose to use a plumber's snake to open a clogged drain. These can be very messy, and may compact the material that is clogging the pipes, making it even more difficult to remove, if the proper technique is not used. See also How to Unclog a Toilet and How to Unclog a Bathtub Drain and How to Unclog a Kitchen Sink.	Identify the problem that is occurring with your drains, specifically, the individual drains which are not functioning correctly. Try to determine the extent of your "slow drain" problem. Determine the route the waste water takes to reach the main drainpipe. Flush the drain which is not operating like it should with very hot water.
Book a hotel stay directly with a chain that offers gas cards as a reward for frequent bookings, such as Choice Hotels.Some hotel booking services, like Hotels.com and Expedia.com, have also offered gas cards as a reward for booking through them.   A few smaller chains or individual hotels also offer gas cards to visitors. Some Kensington Hotels or Personality Hotels offer a complimentary $10 gas card per night's stay. If the hotel you're planning to stay at doesn't have an advertised gas card or free gas offer, inquire. Sometimes the gas-card package costs a little more than the standard room package, but you might still save money once you factor in the money you save on gasoline.  "Drivertising" companies pay you a monthly fee in return for the right to place advertisements, ranging from rear-window decals to full-car covers, on your vehicle.   "Drivertising" companies to investigate include gasforfree.com and freegashelp.com. Often, these offers are only extended to frequent drivers that average more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) per month. However, some agencies will make exceptions, especially if you live near a university or areas with high pedestrian activity.Other requirements include having a late-model vehicle in good repair, a clean driving record and valid insurance. You may get a bonus, or qualify for special advertising, if you drive a specialty vehicle or have an occupation, such as pizza delivery, that requires you to drive long distances every day., Ever notice that you've never seen a patrol car filling up at a gas station? That's because police officers in metropolitan areas usually get to fill up for free at specific guarded locations. This only applies to the unit cars, not their daily drivers, but it's an effective way at getting gas for free and getting around town on the city's dime.   Other jobs that let you use vehicles with gas in them include parks departments and other city jobs. You usually don't have to pay for gas, or you'll be reimbursed after the fact.  Carpooling can be a great way of getting someone else to spring for the gas. If you give someone a ride somewhere, ask if they wouldn't mind springing for a little extra in the tank, or giving you some cash to help cover it. Totally fair request.   Some state and local governments also offer gas cards as an incentive for carpooling.Sometimes, the offers will be for other kinds of bonuses, like gift cards to restaurants or coffee shops. Still, free stuff!  , If you're traveling and need a car, you can sometimes get a little in the tank for free. Some rental companies offer a free tank of gas with select rentals, or as a part of other offers. If you don't have a strong opinion about what car you drive, or are willing to negotiate, you might luck out.  You can usually redeem reward points for gift cards at the merchant of your choice, which sometimes includes gas stations, or fillable gas cards that will come with some money already loaded on. These can be a great and hassle free way of getting some extra gas at the pump.  Some banks offer free gas as an incentive to draw new members. Keep an eye out for these kinds of offers and try signing up for a new savings account to keep all the money you're saving at the pump.   Research the terms and conditions of opening an account with that bank before you march in and ask for your gas card. In some cases, you may be required to maintain a minimum balance, or you may be charged a maintenance fee for keeping the account open.	Stay at a hotel that offers free gas rewards. Offer your vehicle as a moving billboard. Be a cop. Give people rides and make them pay. Ask about free gas the next time you rent a car. Participate in survey rewards programs and credit card rewards programs. Open a new checking or savings account.
The shade of a room’s walls can greatly affect not only the look but also the feel of a space. For example, if you want an open, roomy area, keep the walls a bright, neutral color like white, eggshell, or cream. These colors are more reflective and help maximize any natural light in the room.You can even paint the wall trim or moldings a lighter color than your walls, which will make the walls appear further back. Thus making the room appear bigger.; , If you want to combat the amount of open space and make the room feel a bit cozier, paint the walls a dark color. Darker colors absorb light and will make a room appear smaller than it is.Try a charcoal gray or slate blue. You can even paint the ceiling a darker color, which will make it feel lower., Most accent walls are the first walls you see when entering a room. However, you can choose any wall you want. Try a wall that is visually interesting, for example, one with a fireplace or unique molding. Choose bright or bold color like brick red or evergreen, or a contrasting color to the other wall paint. This wall will draw the eye and break the room up., When choosing lighting for a vaulted ceiling, you want to make sure you are highlighting the ceiling rather than drawing away from it. Try to stay away from any light fixture that shines light directly downward and instead install a fixture like a chandelier that throws light in all directions.  If you want the ceiling to be the focal point of a room, go for a light fixture that's minimalistic. For example, you can use recessed lighting for a sophisticated look that's unobtrusive. It won't draw from the beauty of the ceiling, but will still provide a significant coverage of light in the room.You can also try spotlighting for a more modern look.  Most rooms with vaulted ceilings have tall windows that provide a multitude of natural light. However, you can increase this light by adding skylights or putting in mirrors to reflect the light around the room.   Try placing mirrors on opposite walls to bounce light back and forth.  To keep a room spacious, leave windows open and uncovered. Try utilizing blinds in a bright white that don't draw much attention. However, if you want to bring more intimacy or closeness to a room, install curtains. Not only do these add softness to a space, they can also work to draw the eye where you want it. For example, if you choose curtains that fit the entire length of the wall, it will help draw the eye upwards. On the other hand, if you want to reduce how tall the room feels, choose shorter curtains.You can also make windows appear larger by setting the curtains on the outside of the edges of the windows. The color and pattern of your curtains are a good way to add a bit of personality, too.  When working with a lot of wall space, break the area up into pieces. The common rule is to visualize the space split into thirds, which will help you plan out how to place pieces. Decorate the bottom and middle thirds and leave the top one blank. For example, plants, sculptures, and other floor pieces would be part of the bottom third of the wall. Art, tapestries, and mirrors would go in the middle third. Leaving the last third of the space empty to help prevent cluttering., Since the wall area in a room with vaulted ceilings is usually spacious, it's best to stick with larger pieces. After all, putting up small items can make the space seem even bigger than it is and end up looking awkward. You can organize your art however you’d like, but keep each painting or gallery wall at or around eye level for people to enjoy., Large vertical items like grandfather clocks or potted plants can add a lot of character to a room. Try keeping them along the walls for a border effect or place them inward to mimic columns. You can also add large sculptures, bookcases, or floor lamps to utilize the space., If you have the chance, try playing with the look of the ceiling. For example, you can add wooden barrel beams or exposed trusses for an old world style. You can also change the texture by covering the ceiling in distressed wood or copper.	Create a spacious vibe with bright neutral colors. Use dark colors to minimize space. Separate the space by painting an accent wall. Avoid light fixtures that only shine down. Choose a fixture that's subtle. Emphasize natural lighting. Invest in window treatments. Remember the rule of thirds. Put up large art pieces. Add tall plants or floor pieces. Change up the ceiling.
Don't try to strike a cutting when it is too hot or too cold. Temperature extremes will cause the cutting to shrivel and die. The best times for striking a cutting are early autumn and early spring.; ,, Both of these provide the perfect medium for a cutting and do not have too much moisture. Soil or potting mix can retain too much moisture, causing the cutting to rot.  Hormone powder can provide the extra zip needed to overcome any adversities such as very hot or cold spells, insects, soil that isn't ideal, etc.  Pat down gently into place but do not make too firm.  Preferably provide more shade than not.  Water every day if very hot but don't drench the soil; aim for moist, not wet, soil or the cutting will rot.	Choose good weather. Cut the lavender.  , Fill a pot with propagating mix or sand. If wished, place a little hormone powder for plants on the ends of the cuttings. Plant in the pot. Place the pot in semi-shade. Water regularly.
Ultrasonic jewelry cleaners can range in price from less than $50 to more than $200. While there are no specific cleaners for rubies, consider the size, hassle and features when purchasing a model.Some tanks are spacious enough to clean sunglasses or watches and can hold numerous items at once. Cleaners with timers offer a stress-free cleaning experience. You choose the time, set the device, and can walk away. High-end devices can include steamers, which offer an additional level of cleaning. This option is good if you have many precious items and plan to clean them regularly to keep their shine. It can, however, run about $200. Check to see if the ultrasonic cleaner requires solution, as some do not. Some cleaners run at the same frequency (42,000 Hz is standard) while others offer different settings to accommodate different types of material.  Unless your ruby stone is fracture-filled or coated to enhance its hue, it should be safe to use in an ultrasonic cleaner.   Ask your jeweler to ensure it is untreated, heat-treated or lattice diffusion treated. Rubies and sapphires are strong enough for an ultrasonic cleaner. Opaque gemstones, opals and organic gems like pearls and ambers are too delicate. Metals like gold and platinum are safe to clean in ultrasonic devices., Add hot water and a couple drops of dishwashing liquid to the ultrasonic cleaner tank. You can also purchase a nontoxic gem-cleaning solution instead of making your own for about $5 to $10. Any standard jewelry cleaner works, but check the label to be sure there are no exceptions.  Once the solution is in the device, let it run for 5 to 10 minutes to mix the solution entirely before using.  Be sure to only add a few pieces at once into the cleaner in order to avoid scratches during the process.  Depending on the dirtiness of the ruby, you’ll run the cleaner up to 20 minutes. If it’s your first time cleaning your stone, start with a shorter time frame and add on if it’s still dirty.  After the ultrasonic cleaner runs, let your rubies sit in there for 5 to 10 minutes before removing. This will help to ensure that the loosened dirt and grime falls to the bottom of the device.  There might be some dirt and grime still stuck to your ruby, so grab a soft bristle brush to remove anything lingering. Carefully scrub the stone. Once it’s fully cleaned, dry your ruby with a lint-free cloth.	Purchase an ultrasonic cleaner. Check your ruby before cleaning it. Make your solution. Mix up the solution. Add your rubies to the cleaner. Run the device. Let your jewelry sit in the cleaner. Gently scrub your ruby.
Remember that you are creating the mood and atmosphere of the event, so think about what is appropriate. To set the tone, you should take a few things into consideration.   What type of event is it? The nature of the function you are playing should factor in hugely when deciding what music to play. You wouldn’t play the same songs in a rocker bar as you would at a wine and cheese party or a middle school dance, would you? Here are a couple rules of thumb for different events.  When the focus of an event or a portion of an event should be on something other than the music, play soft, slower tempo music so as to not take attention away from whatever the true focus may be. For example, at an art opening, the focus should be on the art. During the dinner portion of a wedding, this time is usually used to get to know the people at one’s table. In these cases, slower, softer music without overbearing vocals should be used to keep the focus where it should be. Though your music should not be the focus at this time, your music is still an integral part of the event. When the focus of an event is dancing or partying, make sure to play more upbeat music for the people to dance or sing along to. In this case, your music is the main attraction and your job is to keep people moving. If you are playing at a lounge or somewhere where the music should inspire some movement, but also not overpower conversations, find a balance with music that gets people to groove, but is not so hard hitting that it will be a distraction. Depending on the crowd, melodic or soulful rhythms tend to work in this setting.   What type of crowd is it? This is perhaps the one case where a certain amount of profiling is not such a bad thing. Many times, it is possible to get a loose grasp on the crowd’s musical taste by looking at their clothes, hairstyle, the way they walk, talk etc. This should not determine what you play the entire night, but instead be used as a testing basis, allowing you to feel out the crowd and better pinpoint their likes and dislikes.; , Now that you’ve found your starting point and have determined what genres might work best, it’s time to start honing in on what the crowd wants. The first few songs you play for a new audience are like an introduction, so it’s smart to play it a little bit safe until you get better acquainted. Depending on the crowd, top 40’s music is usually a safe bet, since most people hear these songs on a daily basis. Once you get a sense of which jams they respond to, you can decide what to play next to really satisfy them.  Get them to crawl before they run. If you start off an event with too much excitement, there’s nowhere to go after that and everything else will seem a little disappointing. Also, people might not be ready for craziness right away. More often than not, folks are a little more reserved at the beginning of a party, so it’s important to use your music to stretch their social muscles and get them fully loosened up. As a DJ, you are in charge of bringing the party to its climax and sustaining it as long as possible. Make sure to build up the energy first so they have something to look forward to.  Once you’ve managed to figure out what works with the crowd, you can start digging deeper into their musical tastes or even get them to fall in love with something they didn’t realize was missing from their lives. But, when you are attempting to expose people to something new, it’s important that you build a foundation of trust first. That way they’re more likely to accept something unfamiliar. If that has already been achieved, then its time to really make your mark and separate yourself from the pack. Remember that you will not always please everyone, but at the same time you can’t be great unless you take chances.   One thing you can do is playing a non-pop or “underground” song that has not received much exposure, but is a great song nonetheless. Nothing builds your reputation like having several people visit your booth asking you what song you’re playing. Remixes of popular songs are also a good way of making yourself stand out while playing it safe at the same time. With so many producers out now, you can find many quality remixes of songs at record shops or all over the internet. Creating remixes on the spot can get people to notice you by taking a popular beat or vocals from a song and switching them with the vocals or beat from another song with a matching tempo.  A lot of times, the best part of a party is when the DJ plays something nostalgic that allows people to revisit a time or recapture old feelings. Nothing takes you back like hearing an old song that you have fond memories of. However, it is important to make sure that the song you’re bringing back has not been played so much that it continues to be corny to this day. Unless, of course, that’s what the crowd wants to hear.  Just as it was your responsibility to build up the party, it’s your responsibility to cool it down. This is especially important when you are playing for a venue that wants you to help get everyone out at the end of the night. Make sure to play something down-tempo and non-danceable. At any club, a good exit song combined with the club’s “ugly lights” should be sufficient enough to get everyone to depart from the premises without any fighting or bickering.	Set the tone. Feel out the crowd. Build up the energy. Experiment and don’t be afraid to disappoint. Take it back. Wind down.
If you've never played before, consider your level of dedication and whether you plan on sticking it out for the long run. If you're just curious about the saxophone, then renting one from a reputable music store is cheaper and will ensure that it is in good working condition.However, long-term rental fees can become incredibly expensive, and the condition of a rented saxophone will be worse than buying a new one.The price of a new saxophone can range from $300 to over $3,000.If you are just starting off with the saxophone, buy a beginner sax that's less expensive before investing in a high-quality sax.; , An alto or tenor sax are the best options for someone who is new to the saxophone. Alto saxophones are usually the starting point for most beginners because they require less air than the tenor, and have a smaller key scale which makes them easier to handle for young adults or children.Tenor saxophones are the most closely associated with jazz music. The majority of classic music is written for the alto sax., A damaged saxophone won't produce a good sound and may cost you a lot of money in repairs. Make sure that you choose a reputable music store or saxophone shop in your area when you are looking to buy or rent. Avoid off-brand saxophones because you may have a hard time finding someone who can repair it in the future.   Some reputable brands include Keilwerth, Yamaha, Selmer, and Guardala.If you are still unsure about the brand, reach out to the music store and inquire about brands in your budget. If you are purchasing a sax online, make sure there is a return policy or warranty.  Other accessories that you'll need are a hard saxophone case, neck strap, extra reeds, cork grease, and music stand.The neck strap supports your horn and keeps it close to your body as you play. Reeds are necessary and can break easily, so it's a good idea to pick up extras. Cork grease is used to help move your mouthpiece on your sax, which will affect its pitch.Finally, the music stand enables you to sit sheet music upright, which is critical when playing a song.   Music stores will often offer a beginner saxophone with all the accessories included. Ask the salesperson if they offer these types of packages.	Decide if you want to buy or rent your sax. Determine what kind of saxophone you want. Purchase or rent a well-known brand from a reputable music store. Buy the accessories you'll need to play.
Do this before you wipe them down. Try to get rid of any small bits of garbage in the cupholders, as this will make wiping them down much easier.  Dampen a sponge or cloth with water and soap. Use warm water and mild soap. Wipe down the cup holders, removing surface dirt and gunk.You can also use a vinegar solution instead to clean and disinfect the cup holders. Mix one part vinegar with one part water. Then, wipe the cup holders down with a sponge or cloth soaked in the solution.  If there is a lot of gunk or sticky residue in the cup holders, fill them halfway with warm soap and water. Then, let them soak for one to two minutes. This will help to loosen any hard to remove bits on the cup holders.You can also soak the cup holders in a vinegar solution of one part vinegar and one part water. Soak the holders for one to two minutes.  Wipe out the water or vinegar solution in the holders once they have soaked. You can also use a cup to scoop out the solution in the cup holders., Get a small detailing brush and lightly scrub off any stains or residue on the holders. Dip the brush in soap and water or vinegar and water if the stains are hard to get off. You can also use a small dry rag, a toothbrush, or a Q-tip to remove stains. Try to get at all the small cervices in the cup holders to remove any remaining dirt.Make sure you wipe and scrub at the stains lightly, as rubbing hard on them can end up damaging the surface of the holders.  Once you have finished washing the cup holders, wipe them dry with a clean terry cloth. Let the cup holders air dry overnight before you use them again. This will ensure germs do not build up in the damp or wet cup holders.If you need to use the cup holders right away, you can blow dry them with a blow dryer or wipe them dry really well with a terry cloth. Try to soak up as much water as you can before you use the cup holders.	Remove any items in the cupholders. Wipe the cup holders with a sponge or cloth. Soak the cup holders. Remove the solution in the holders. Use a small detailing brush for hard stains. Dry the cup holders.
There are many different slides you can choose from. Many musicians make slides out of common every day objects, such as glass bottle tops, metal piping, or glass medicine bottles.The easier option for those just starting to use a guitar slide is to buy a new one from a music store. The two most common types are glass and metal slides.   Glass slides are typically lighter and create a airy, sharp sound. Metal slides produce a deeper, warmer, and louder tone but are heavier on your finger. Different slides will sounds different on specific guitars, Before you commit to a slide, test it on your guitar to make sure it creates the sound you want.; , There are three fingers you can wear your slide on, your middle, ring, or pinky finger. The finger you choose will vary the sound you get from the slide as well as the mobility of your remaining fingers.   Your middle finger will need a larger slide since your middle finger is bigger than your others. Using this finger will produce a hearty tone, but you will not be able to use your other fingers to play notes or mute the strings. This means that you will only be able to produce the slide sound. Your ring (or fourth) finger will need a smaller slide than the one for your middle finger. This slide covers the whole fretboard and helps produce a full sound. You can mute the other keys with your index and middle fingers, which allows you to play normal notes as well. Your pinky finger will need a much smaller slide than your other fingers. Your finger will not cover the whole fretboard, but your can use your other three fingers to play normal notes and mute the strings while you play., The best guitar to use for sliding is one with higher action. This means you need to find a guitar that has more room between the fretboard and the strings. If you converting one of your guitars to use for sliding, you can leave your guitar's action high. If you are switching back and forth between sliding and normal playing, you should adjust your action to a higher setting before you try to slide.   This prevents extra noise reverberation between the strings and the fretboard as you slide. If you are using an electric guitar (which typically has low action), you will have better luck with a glass slide., For sliding, you should have open tuning on your guitar. This means that the open string notes should belong to major chords. This kind of tuning makes it great for accompanying other instruments.   Some common open tunings are D-G-D-G-B-D, E-B-E-G#-B-E, and D-A-D-F#-A-D.If open tuning is unfamiliar to you, you can use a regular tuned guitar. You just may not be able to get the same kind of sound out of your guitar from sliding. You can use online resources to help you open tune your guitar. You can also ask someone else to help you get it tuned correctly.	Pick your slide. Choose which finger to put the slide on. Use the right guitar. Tune your guitar for sliding.
It's a fair bet that writing will cost less than motorcycle racing. Money isn't the only reason to choose or avoid a hobby, but you should certainly consider the costs.  Choose hobbies that require time, creativity, skill, ingenuity, or knowledge rather than money or gear. Light aircraft flying, designer shopping, car modding and playing the latest video games are all likely to be expensive hobbies. Perhaps saving up for them in the future is a better approach than trying to participate in them now without the money needed to make them enjoyable.; , Gardening isn't a cheap hobby if you decide you need a riding mower and a pickup truck to get it done, or if you change plants as often as you change clothes. Instead, enjoy the challenge and the rewards of growing from seed, transplants, and cuttings. Get smaller plants cheaply and grow them into larger ones. Learn to save seeds if you like to grow vegetables or other annuals.  On the other hand, if you have a large area to mow, a riding mower might be worth the investment, especially if it frees up your time to enjoy the gardening as a whole. Could you share both the mower and the cost with neighbors?  , If you have to drive for hours to see snow, don't ski. Find something else to do outdoors, such as skating or bicycling., You can learn a lot about photography with a $20 secondhand camera and some practice. You can do a lot of astronomy with your own eyes or with the pair of binoculars you already own. Learning the hobby first is also a good way to avoid having stacks of leftover stuff if you tend to switch around frequently.  Borrow or rent to try out hobbies that require large investments in gear such as mountain climbing or hang-gliding, before you start buying. If you find you dislike them or simply don't have time to pursue them, you won't be left with a lot of depreciating equipment. Learn to be resourceful rather than spend money. Look for used equipment and materials opportunities. Many hobbyists sell their good condition equipment through clubs, in the newspaper, and online.  If you enjoy doing something, do more of it using what you already have rather than starting new hobbies or projects frequently.  Sometimes you can use common equipment and build common skills for a single basic activity while enjoying it in very different contexts. For instance, if you're now a classical violinist, you might enjoy "fiddling" for folk music, too.If you're now a wedding, portrait, documentary, or wildlife photographer, you might enjoy sports photography (don't buy a monster lens, just increase the ISO a bit) and, while you're at it, learn how to deal with the jumpiest subjects possible. This doesn't mean you shouldn't try new things. It does mean that you should stay the course, complete projects, and master the hobbies you have already chosen to pursue before chasing new ones.  For equipment, choose durable items that will last a long time and give you plenty of use. Assuming you will pursue a hobby for a long time to come, plan for your supplies to last a long time., Once you have good, durable equipment, do what is necessary to keep it in good working order. Often, minor maintenance along the way can prevent major maintenance later on. Whether it means rinsing your swimsuit or oiling your sewing machine, take the time to keep your gear in good shape., You can't knit without yarn or quilt without fabric, but that doesn't mean you need to stockpile or hoard yarn. Try to have a project in mind before purchasing supplies.  For some creative pastimes, it is worth keeping some supplies around so that they're available when inspiration strikes. If this is the way you pursue your hobby, gradually build up a reasonable selection of supplies as your budget permits. Then, try to acquire supplies at about the same rate you use them. Keeping your "stash" at a reasonable level will also help make it easy to organize. Try to use up your supplies or "outgrow" your gear before buying more. Keep in mind supplies that go out of stock or change with time. For example, paint or fabric patterns might change if you don't get enough at the beginning of your project. In this case, stockpiling is a safeguard of quality rather than hoarding. Learn to make the most of simple materials. Some people do incredible, photorealistic drawings with a basic, ballpoint pen. Woodworkers sometimes hold 2x4 contests, where the objective is to make something wonderful from a single building-grade 2x4 board.  Buy used if it makes sense to do so. Many people stop pursuing hobbies after a time and sell or discard perfectly good, used equipment and supplies. Watch for sales and bargains on the items you buy new.       One dollar worth of thrift store thread made a scarf, a toy hammock, and a couple of coasters.  Look into getting used gear or supplies, especially your first time out, for costly items. Thrift store yarn or a skein of cheap acrylic will get you a long way to learning knitting or crochet much more cheaply than making your mistakes on fancy yarn. If you have $200 to spend on a bicycle, see if you can get a better used bike for that price than a new one. If your hobby is seasonal, look for opportunities to get things at the end of their seasons when they are marked down for clearance. Use found materials, discarded materials, scraps, or remnants. Besides being free or low-cost, scraps can constrain and focus your creativity in unexpected, serendipitous ways.  Get into do-it-yourself home improvement. Learn woodworking or canning. Grow your own food, or some of it. Riding a bike could save you a lot of money on fuel and wear and tear on your car, not to mention the cost of a gym membership.        Choose complementary hobbies. If you love to ride bikes, try learning how to fix them, too. If you already love to cook, canning or other food preservation methods may be a natural next step. One hobby could save you money on the other and extend your skills without needing a lot of new stuff.  Cooking and many crafts (woodworking, painting, crochet, etc.) fall into this category, but don't forget things like teaching, storytelling, and helping others with repairs or improvements., It can be incredibly rewarding to help others, and may cost little or nothing. And it soon becomes a very enjoyable hobby., Set budgets both for money and, if necessary, for your time. Set aside a certain amount of money each week, each month, or each payday. You can use a jar at home, a separate bank account (such as a Christmas Club account), or any bookkeeping strategy you want to keep your hobby money separate. Use this money for supplies, equipment, travel, and any other hobby related expenses, and don't go over it., Not all hobbies require travel, but if yours involves travel or going to events, include these costs in your budget, and keep the number and costs of the events you attend reasonable. You can decide what reasonable is for you.  Figure for travel costs, admission, entry fees, hotels, and any other costs associated with attendance. Attend only local events and meets, or attend the local meets/shows and one or two big regional ones annually. Or consider attending on alternate years.  If you do race motorcycles, do you really need more than one? Does it need to be the top of the line, or can it be a dependable, mid-range model? Remember that you must maintain it, store it, haul it around, and so on., Some hobbyists make professions of their hobbies, or at least make a little extra money. The level where your sales cover your materials and treats comes quite early, the level you can use it as a second job or live on it takes more skill and more work. Self supporting hobbies often allow you to use the best and most expensive materials and tools as those pay for themselves with better sales and better pricing.  Sell your creations. If you make something in the course of your hobby, get good at it and try selling it. Be sure to price it appropriately. Sell your services. If you've learned how to repair bicycles or cars, tend a garden, paint portraits, or take photographs, see if you can start a business doing that or work for someone else who does. Teach your hobby. Offer lessons in doing whatever you've gotten good at.  Write about your hobby. Especially if you have gotten into something unusual, write about your hobby and sell your book or the advertisements on your website. Invent equipment or equipment modifications related to your hobby and sell those.      A pattern for baby shoes.  Invent projects and sell plans or patterns to other hobbyists.	Pursue less costly hobbies.  Keep ancillary costs down.  Stay close to home.  Learn the hobby well before you buy or upgrade too much gear.  Stick to hobbies and projects that you like.  Consider new purchases carefully.  Maintain your equipment.  Buy only the supplies you know you will use.  Get a better price.  Choose hobbies that will save you money, or at least improve your lifestyle at moderate expense.  Choose hobbies that will result in gifts you don't have to buy.  Volunteer your time.  Pace yourself.  Keep travel and event costs in check.  Practice your hobby on a modest scale.  Go pro.
Find out what part you're auditioning for, when the time period is, and what you need to portray in order to get the part. Also double check the rehearsal times to make sure it does not interfere with your schedule, because the last thing you want is to get the lead and then have to quit because it interferes. This will only give you a bad reputation.; , Most companies will have a form for you to fill out but already having a pre-made resume will help you look prepared! When you go to the audition, they will need to know your past experience as well as any special skills you have. They also need to how to contact you. Write your name, email address, home phone, and address at the top and then any experience you've had in past productions, music, dance and acting. If you already have a resume, bring it!  , If it is a musical you are auditioning for, you will need to sing a piece from a Broadway musical. Choosing a proper song is crucial. First of all, rule out any music from Wicked, Rent, Les Miserable or Cats. These musicals are so huge and so overdone. You want a piece that hasn't been used very much. Your song should represent your vocal capabilities and show your strengths.  This could mean either they love you and already know exactly what part you're going to get, or they can tell what your voice type is from the first few verses and don't need to hear any more.  It is very important to bring sheet music. In some theatres, they won't even take you into consideration if you don't have sheet music. It makes you sound better and keeps you on key! A capella is not allowed unless they specify it!  , At the theatre, they may have you learn a small piece from the play (only a couple of steps) just so the choreographer can get a feel on who has rhythm and who has two left feet. If you aren't a very good dancer, practice a bit before. The moves are usually very basic and you may not even be asked to do it. Just make sure you dress in clothes that are easy to move in and bring dance shoes if you have them.  You can almost be guaranteed that they will ask you to recite a monologue. You can find them all over the internet. Make sure that the monologue you choose is age appropriate and if you are auditioning for a role, make sure it fits that sort of character. Your monologue should be about 2 minutes long and memorized. Also, bring with you an extra copy of the words as a reference just in case you freeze.  Make sure what you wear is comfortable and easy to move in while still looking presentable. You want to show them you are prepared and ready. Break a leg!	Find out more about the play you will be auditioning for. Create a resume and bring it with you to the audition. Pick a song!, Do not be discouraged if you are stopped short in the middle of a song. Find the Sheet Music!, Be prepared to dance. Find a monologue!, Dress for the occasion.
Choose something like a coffee can, a yogurt bottle, a plastic food container, etc. Wash and clean the container, allow to dry completely.  Pull the end of it over and around the container. This will keep it intact.  Sprinkle a layer of approximately 2 tablespoons of grass seeds. , Tie a knot with it to enclose the soil. Ensure that it is firmly in place.  The knot should be at the base of the container.  Draw on any other features. Use waterproof markers and glue as the features will constantly get wet.  Soak it well to ensure it is completely wet.  Keep watered.  Within a week, the grass will sprout and continue to grow.  To keep the grass buddy neat, trim regularly.	Choose a suitable container. Put the stocking inside the container. Add a small layer of soil to the base of the pot, on top of the stocking. Fill the remaining space with soil.  , Pick up the top of the stocking. Turn the whole soil-filled stocking ball over. Add googly eyes for eyes. Pour water over the grass buddy. Transfer the grass buddy to a small plate or saucer, knot end still down. Wait. Trim as needed.
Ask yourself these questions:   What type of transmission do you have? Some starters only work on automatic transmissions. Do you have a fuel-injected engine? If not, you will have to purchase a remote starter system specially made for your type of truck.; , Your budget will be the main determinant of what options and upgrades are available to you. Remember that, in addition to the basics mentioned above, your remote starter installation may also include these features, among others:   Keyless entry. Security system with alarm. A different frequency each time you use the remote starter. The ability to transmit at a greater distance than the standard 1000 feet (0.9 km), sometimes up to 1 mile (1.6 km) and even through concrete walls. An LCD screen status display.

Find retailers that sell the remote starter you are interested in and shop around for the best price.
Using a paintbrush and a roller, gently brush an even coat of the primer on the surface of the wood. Use a paintbrush along corners, edges, and harder-to-reach areas; use the roller to hit wide-spaced, even areas that aren't contoured. Allow the primer to dry before moving on to painting the furniture piece.          Do you really need to use a primer? If you want your coat of paint to adhere evenly to the wood, and you want the paint to last long, you're going to want to add a primer before you paint. Don't worry about getting even coverage with the primer; as long as it coats what you're going to paint, you're good to go. If you're going for more of a weathered, distressed look on your furniture, you may want to skip the primer. Note that the paint may eventually chip if no primer has been set down before painting. Prime often-used surfaces extra thick for added coverage. If you're painting a tabletop or a desktop, you may want to lather on a couple layers — or one thick layer — to give added protection and sheen to often-used parts of your furniture.  Go over every area of primed surface with a fine-grit sandpaper. This will help your paint bond to the primer even better than it already does. Be sure, however, to wipe away any sawdust or residue with a tack cloth before you hit the surface with paint.  Go over even surfaces of the furniture with a foam roller, if possible. Then, using even strokes, redo the area with a paintbrush, paying special attention to the places where rollers cannot apply paint — such as edges and corners. Allow the coat to dry, and inspect the piece for any areas that are not completely covered by the paint.          Consider using a paint conditioner to make your job easier. A paint conditioner, such as Floetrol for latex paints and Penetrol for oil paints, will slow down the drying edge of the paint, allowing you to get a more even look on your paint. (Paint that dries too quickly can look patchy or uneven.) Paint conditioners, although added to your paint, won't change the color. Get a good quality paintbrush for the job. Poor-quality brushes will result in inferior looking projects; bristles will come loose and get stuck in the paint, or the coverage just won't look uniform. A good paintbrush is slightly more expensive, but with proper care, should prove you wise by lasting for several years.  Most painters will find that a coat of primer and paint won't give the furniture that professional look that they're seeking. Wait for the first coat of paint to dry (overnight is best, but at least 6 hours), and then hit it with another coat of the same paint, using the methods described above.  Once the paint is dry, apply a lacquer or sealant to protect the paint from nicks and scratches. This will also add a slight gloss to the piece, a feature that works well in many decorating schemes. Make sure the sealant is dry before moving the piece into the area of the home where it will be used.	Prime if you want an even look on your furniture. Sand the primed surface after it has dried. Paint the wooden furniture, first with a roller and later with a brush. Apply a second coat of paint, if necessary. Seal the paint job on the wooden furniture (optional). Finished.
You can get double sided paper at any craft store. Don’t use regular paper, it won’t be strong enough to make this kind of greeting card.  You can make an opening in your paper rectangle by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Now make another fold two inches from the top. Once you’ve done that, you need to draw a one-inch line from the corner of this fold at a 45 degree angle inward. Cut along that inch line.When you unfold the paper, you should be left with an ‘X’ cut in your original paper. The cut that you make will be going through multiple layers because of your folds to form this ‘X’.  You should also erase the pencil mark at this time. You want to smooth the fold lines so that the card doesn’t look bunched up and unprofessional.  Place the paper on its front side and take each triangle of the ‘X’ cut and fold it back toward you. There should be four triangle folds that leave you with a square window once you fold them back.Once you have folded the flaps back, glue them down.  You can now design an image to put inside the window, put a stamp in there, or anything else. Draw patterns or other elements on the face of the card for added personality.  If you want it to be a greeting card, you need to write something on the card that indicates what the event is. Make the theme of the card appropriate for this event. Birthdays, anniversaries, and marriages are all appropriate events for a greeting card.	Cut a 4x5" rectangle out of thick double sided paper or cardstock. Make an opening. Smooth the fold lines. Fold the pieces of the ‘X’ cut back. Add decorations as you see fit. Add your greeting.
In areas not used to grow other crops, you can apply tebuthiuron (Spike) to your soil. This can kill blackberry bushes, but may also harm other surrounding vegetation.Place tebuthiuron pellets to the base of blackberry plants to control their growth long-term.Be aware that tebuthiuron is toxic not only to vegetation, but can also be to mammals, too.It is also water soluble, so it can easily contaminate ground water. Wear protective clothing when you apply tebuthiuron to minimize your exposure to the pesticide.Make sure to check and see if it is legal to use tebuthiuron where you live. It has been banned in Europe since 2002 because if its toxicity.  One of the most effective ways to kill blackberries is by applying an herbicide directly to the plant while it is actively growing. This allows it to get into the plant’s structure and kill rhizomes, thus deterring regrowth.Use foliar-based herbicides, which you apply to the part of the plant visible above the ground, in early summer or at the start of the growing season when their tissue is rapidly expanding.Spray herbicides such as glyphosate, dicamba, or triclopyr on the blackberry bush.You can purchase these at many home improvement and hardware stores. Be careful when mixing and applying these chemicals because they can kill other plants. Make sure to avoid contact with your skin as well.  Since the bark at the base of the bush helps transport the nutrients needed for the plant to survive, treat it with an herbicide. This can help kill the bush at any time of year and also minimize contact with chemicals.Use a concentrated form of triclopyr to treat the basal bark.Spray the solution directly at base of the bush directly on the bark.Cover about 6-12 inches of the basal bark with spray, depending on how large the plant is.Make sure to not oversaturate the bark with the solution, which can cause toxic runoff., An alternative way to administer triclopyr is to spray the dormant stems and leaves of your blackberry bush. This can also kill the plant while minimizing your contact with the chemical.Use this solution only in the fall and winter when the plant stem and leaves are dormant.Spray the plant until it is thoroughly wet, again avoiding oversaturation that can cause toxic runoff., If your blackberry bush growth is especially pernicious, consider hiring a landscape professional. He can help you assess and deal with the problem without killing off all of your other vegetation.Discuss your concerns with the landscaper and ask about how to manage the situation more effectively after his treatment. The Landscape Contractors Association can help you find a qualified landscape professional in your local area.	Place an herbicide in the soil. Apply an herbicide directly on the plant. Treat the basal bark. Spray the dormant stems and leaves. Hire a landscape professional.
They may be roses, flocks, jasmine, and other flowers or herbs, shrubs, etc. Carefully lift the plants and keep them up from the ground until you can return them to the ground elder free border.  Unpick any ground elder roots. Keep all the plants in water in trugs in the shade., Rotate the soil to about 9"., Repeat the rotation and raking., Try to remove as much root as possible from within the holes.,, Use a pressure spray pot with the jet set on accurate jet, not spray, being careful to avoid the plants.  Verdone will prove very effective. You should now only find perhaps three leaves in the entire border.  This reduces the reserve root system to such a degree that it can't withstand the Verdone, which is exactly the opposite of normal advice. It should prove very satisfying to have virtually beaten the ground elder pest.	Lift all the flower or other plants that you want to preserve up from the border. Wash all the roots with a pressure hose. Remove the top growth of ground elder. Rake off as much root as possible. Make suitably sized holes for the clean plants.Once a week for six months when watering the plants, pull up any new leaves that will often come up, with short chopped up roots while the soil is loose. When the soil becomes compacted again, squirt any new growth with Verdone. Mash up the roots in the ground into short pieces.

When you use thrift shopping to collect “new” items for redecorating, you have to accept that you won't be able to find all the perfect pieces for your project at once. If you plan to work room by room instead of setting a unified theme for the entire house, you open up many more design options and run a better chance of finding at least one or two things you can use on each trip.   Don't neglect garage and estate sales when shopping for elements. During warm months, these can drastically increase your chances of finding a perfect item.  Sometimes, you can even find good deals at dedicated vintage or antique shops, but don't depend on them for the bulk of your searching. As a general rule, you'll get better deals elsewhere.   Themes don't have to be different for every room, but the more different themes you use, the more items will become viable potential purchases. On the flip side, you don't need to choose clashing themes just to maximize your chances. Themes should always reflect your tastes first. Although there are plenty of contemporary items available at thrift shops, you might have better luck going for a more vintage or retro theme. Try mid-century modern, with its soft geometric designs and warm color palette, for a timeless look; consider a maritime theme with dark woods, brass and glass accents, and maps or paintings of tall-masted ships for a study or den. Other easy themes to find pieces for include Art Deco, French country cottage, and late Victorian.; , Come up with two routes for your thrift store shopping. One route should contain the three or four closest thrift stores to where you live; the other should contain all the thrift stores in your area that you think you can handle in one shopping day. (including the stores on the first route). You'll use the first route when you only have an hour or two to spare, and reserve the longer route for weekend afternoons and the like. List stores in your area, then use Google Maps to enter each address and come up with a route that allows you to hit them without wasting time or gas.   You can visit thrift store directories such as The Thrift Shopper to get a list of many stores in your area by zip code (you might be surprised how many there are). Make a note of each store that sounds even a little bit promising; plan to at least drop in at each one you add to your list, and then pare it down based on what you learn. Not every thrift shop is on The Thrift Shopper or its sister sites. Feel free to supplement your list with a Google search or a look at the Yellow Pages listings for thrift shops in your area.  For a long trip especially, it helps to have a container of drinking water close at hand. If you plan to visit bin-type thrift stores where you'll have to dig through unsorted bins, pack a pair of leather-palm gardening gloves to protect your hands. Bring a reusable shopping bag, too, just in case no hand baskets are available and you want to buy more than a couple of items. Items such as baby wipes and hand sanitizer are fine, but not usually necessary unless you plan to eat during your trip.   Don't over-pack. It's nice to be prepared, but this is really just another shopping trip. The goal is to keep yourself comfortable enough that you don't get frustrated, not to plan for a thrift store apocalypse.  Any items you know you no longer want can be loaded into your vehicle and taken with you to any nonprofit thrift store, such as the ARC (Value Village), Goodwill, or the Salvation Army. They'll take your old items off your hands for free, and even provide a receipt, since such donations are tax-deductible. Don't donate anything that absolutely needs to be replaced the same day, since you might not find a suitable replacement right away. Instead, donate such items after you find their replacements.   You can also hold a garage sale for your old items, but donating them is faster, easier, and generally more efficient at getting them out of your house for good. Consider holding a sale first, and then donating whatever is left.  Give yourself a daily money or time limit, whichever you prefer, and stick to it. Consider setting a second monetary limit that dictates what the absolute maximum is that you're willing to spend on any single item. That way, if you've picked up $45 of goods on a $60 budget, but you then come across something you absolutely have to have for your home that costs $30, you can extend the budget up to your single-item maximum without feeling guilty.   Buy and grab quickly. It's useful to have a slightly flexible budget in part because good items at thrift stores never stay for very long. If you see something you love that would put you slightly over budget for the day, it's better to buy it than come back tomorrow hoping it'll still be there. A few thrift stores offer discounts that change from week to week on certain items. Goodwill color codes its tags and sells one color of tag at 50% off each week; Value Village often has one day a week (typically Monday) when all used items are 25% off. Learn which stores offer discounts when, and try to incorporate them into your routine. At garage sales and some small, mom-and-pop thrift stores, you can haggle for a better price, especially on items a bit more expensive than the average. Don't be afraid to make an offer; the worst the seller can do is refuse.  You can't usually find specific pieces when you shop for used goods, but if you have a theme in mind, you can often spot items that would be a perfect fit for it. The item doesn't have to be period authentic, but it shouldn't look cheap or inexpertly made, either. Cheap items tend to be overpriced at thrift stores compared to their better-made counterparts, which might cost a few dollars more but which are excellent deals by comparison. Don't forget to shop for furniture as well as accent pieces, pictures, and knickknacks.   Thoroughly inspect every item you find before you buy it, even if that means sitting on the floor and lifting or upending a piece of furniture. Often, a deal that seems too good to be true is the result of damage somewhere on the item that isn't immediately apparent. There's nothing wrong with small flaws that can't normally be seen, but be wary of significant damage. Imagine possibilities. Often, an item with no apparent decorative value can turn out to be useful by making simple alterations or even just approaching it as though it were a decorative item. Vintage cookie presses, for example, often come in old-fashioned boxes that look great on a kitchen mantel. Scrap fabric with an interesting pattern can be stretched and framed for an unusual piece of wall art. Try imagining how items could fit into one of your themes before you pass them by for being a little unusual.  Start by making sure the room is clean and free of junk or items on the floor you could trip over. Hang wall items using a level to ensure good, clean angles; heavier items should be hung from studs as well, so invest in a stud finder if you need to (they aren't very expensive). Furniture and lighting can be rearranged as you see fit. Don't be afraid to move items you already own and try new configurations to get the best effect. You might even find some change under the couch!   Don't set items on new shelving or table space until you're completely satisfied with its location. Nothing is more annoying than loading up a new bookshelf with books and then changing your mind about its location 10 minutes later.	Plan themes by room. Plan your trip. Pack supplies. Load up donations. Budget. Shop with an open mind. Place items carefully.
This is the most costly, but also the most proficient way how to learn music. A good instructor will not only have a proven track record of helping beginners learn music, but also be able to teach you the basics correctly. Using an instructor helps you avoid bad habits that can take a long time to unlearn.   Review sight reading, fingering, and playing with an instructor. Ask the instructor to review where the notes are located on the staff and the piano.  Because your goal is to teach yourself how to play, then you probably won’t be visiting an instructor frequently. Go to an instructor once a month just to do a check-up on your progress or to ask questions about anything that is puzzling you. For instance, you might have questions about if you’re playing a song in the correct tempo.  Once again, you will need to practice a great deal in order to learn how to play. Many people that visit piano teachers practice several times a week. So, practice two to three times a week or everyday if you like. Plan on practicing playing for at least 30 minutes two times a week, but you also will need to take time out to review your notes and sight reading abilities. You don’t need a keyboard or a piano to practice those..	Look for an instructor. Decide how often to see an instructor. Practice.
Rinse whatever type of potatoes you like under cold water. Scrub them gently with a vegetable brush. Use the brush to clean off any dirt, paying special attention to the eyes.For small potatoes, try using red skinned or tricolor baby potatoes. For large potatoes, try using white or Yukon Gold potatoes.; , Slice regular-sized potatoes into half-inch pieces. Cut baby potatoes into halves or quarters. Leave the peels on for this recipe. Place the potato chunks into a bowl of cold water as you’re working if you want to prevent them from browning.The inside of potatoes will turn brown or pink quickly when exposed to oxygen. This effect does not alter the taste of the potatoes.Try to keep potato chunks about the same size, so that they will cook at an equal rate.You can keep the potatoes in the bowl of water overnight, if necessary., Remove the potato chunks from your work surface or bowl of water. Transfer them into a large, empty pot. Placing the potatoes in the pot before adding water prevents uneven cooking.Boiling water before adding the potato chunks is not recommended, as it can result in the outsides of the potatoes cooking faster than the insides.  Pour cold water over the potatoes until the water reaches one inch above the potatoes. Add salt to the water.Use one teaspoon of kosher salt, or half a teaspoon of table salt., Leave the pot uncovered. Set the heat to high. Wait until large bubbles are breaking the surface of the water.If you’re in a hurry, you can cover the pot with a lid. Just keep an eye on it. If the water is rising and about to boil over, remove the lid., Reduce the heat to low or medium-low. Cover the pot with a lid. Let it simmer at a gently rolling boil.If the water is not maintaining a gentle boil at low temperature, raise the temperature to medium-low.  Look for one of the largest chunks of potato. Pierce it with a fork or paring knife. Do this about every minute until the potatoes are done.The potatoes should be tender, but not too soft. If the fork goes in easily with just a little bit of resistance, the potatoes are fully cooked.Most potatoes will be cooked in ten to twenty minutes. For example, russet potatoes and Yukon gold potatoes cook slightly quicker than red potatoes.  Use a colander to carefully pour out the water and separate the potatoes. Place the colander of potatoes inside of a pot., Dress the potatoes while they’re still hot. Putting the colander inside of a pot allows you to preserve the excess vinegar that the potatoes don’t absorb., Rinse the vegetables well and pat them dry. You can substitute any crunchy vegetables for those recommended, if desired. Dice a red pepper, celery stalks, red onion, and carrots.For example, you may want to substitute radishes, onion, broccoli, cauliflower, or arugula.  Dice them into bite-sized pieces. Use a chef’s knife or a manual food chopper. Place the vegetables into a large bowl., Rinse parsley well, over a colander in the sink. Over a cutting board, separate the leaves from the stems and place the leaves in a pile. Rock a large chef’s knife over the parsley until it is minced.Alternately, you can use a hand-powered food chopper to mince the parsley. Optionally, add up to 1/4 cup (total) of other fresh herbs such as basil, chives or thyme., Pour the vegetables you’ve already chopped into a large bowl. Chop a cupful of pickled vegetables and add them to the bowl. Mix in mustard seed, celery seed, salt and pepper.  Instead of mustard seed, you can use two tablespoons of yellow mustard. You can substitute a half cup of sweet pickle relish for the pickled vegetables.  Allow the potatoes to cool for at least 30 minutes before adding mayonnaise, so that the dressing doesn’t melt and turn oily. Stir the mayonnaise, vegetables, herb and seasoning together. Add the potatoes and excess vinegar from the pot. Gently toss the contents of the bowl.If you don’t want a mayonnaise base, use one cup of reduced-calorie ranch salad dressing.Another option to use instead of mayonnaise is three teaspoons of honey and the juice of one and a half lemons.For a mayonnaise mixture, use half the recommended amount of mayonnaise and half light sour cream., Take a bit of the salad on a spoon and evaluate the flavor. Add more vinegar, salt or pepper, if needed. If the salad isn’t tangy enough, add a bit of yellow mustard or freshly-squeezed lemon juice.If the salad tastes bland, add some kosher salt or freshly ground black pepper.  Garnish the top of the salad with dill or parsley, if desired.Place the salad in an airtight container. Let it chill in the refrigerator for four to twenty-four hours before serving., Add crusty bread to the table. Optionally, give each person a small dish of olive oil to dip the bread into. Bread is a great compliment to potato salad.Instead, you could serve potato salad sandwiches, by putting potato salad on hamburger buns and adding sliced tomato and leaves of lettuce., Choose side dishes that go well with potato salad. For instance, baked beans, pasta salad or cole slaw. Serve a main dish that is popular for picnics or barbeques, such as hamburgers. Consider serving pie or cookies for dessert!, Beer that is full of flavor pairs nicely with potato salad. For non-alcoholic beverages, try lemonade or iced tea.  For example, try a German wheat beer or a Bavarian-style bear that is light amber in color.	Wash the potatoes. Cut the potatoes into chunks. Put the potatoes in a pot. Cover the potatoes with cold, salted water. Bring the water to a boil. Simmer the potatoes. Begin checking doneness at the five minute mark. Drain the potatoes immediately. Pour vinegar onto the potatoes. Wash vegetables. Chop the vegetables. Mince fresh herbs. Mix the fresh produce with seasonings and pickled veggies. Combine the ingredients with mayonnaise. Taste the salad. Refrigerate the salad. Serve bread. Serve complimentary foods. Choose beverages to serve.
Eminem has his own style which is well-known all over the world. He often use syllabic raps like: His palms are sweaty, knees weak arms are heavy. And not only one word raps like dog and fog.	Rhyming style is very important.
For a dresser, check that the following things are in good working order (and if not, repair them):   The drawers slide in and out without sticking. The drawers are intact, have no nails or other sharp objects sticking out anywhere and have no broken bits. Check that the legs are sturdy and that the dresser does not wobble. Test this on an even surface, otherwise you might assume that the dresser is uneven when it's actually the floor. There are no unsightly indentations or scratches. If there are, treat these with an appropriate wood-filling agent and sand off before adding the refinish. If the dresser has a mirror, check for cracks, chips or spotting. Mirrors can be DIY repaired to a certain extent, but you may wish to seek the advice of an expert. If the dresser has spindles, check that these are in good order, without chips or cracks, etc. If the dresser has doors, check that the hinges are in good condition. If not, replace these with nice new ones.	Undertake any repairs that may be needed before refinishing the surface.
Moss is a wonderfully diverse plant, with dozens of variations of the traditional pillow-soft green roughage. There are two general types of moss though: pleurocarpous and acrocarpous. Pleurocarpous type moss grows low to the ground and spreads out horizontally very quickly. Acrocarpous type moss grows primarily in clumps and grows in height/thickness before spreading outwards.No mosses are flowering. At times they will produce small stalks with enlarged tips containing spores for reproduction. These are the sporangia. If you’re covering a large space - such as your entire lawn - with moss, consider using a mixture of both pleurocarpous and acrocarpous moss.; , If you want to get some professional advice on the best type of moss for your garden, or if you just would like the ability to view a wide variety of plants, head to your local nursery to get your moss starters. Different types of moss are compatible with each other, so don’t be afraid to mix and match the plants.   If you want the convenience of a large selection of mosses but aren’t near a nursery, there are plenty of mosses available for mail-order on the internet. Check the growth rate for the moss you choose on the plant tag. Some mosses grow at an incredibly fast rate of growth, so you may not need to purchase as much of some species as others.  If you’re not too picky about the type of moss you want to grow or are a bit more frugal, try getting your moss from the wild. Simply use a spade to dig a patch out of the ground or off the trunk of a tree. Try to pick up a bit of the matter/soil it is growing out of when you grab it, to help keep it alive and make transplanting easier.  Moss isn’t too terribly finicky, but there are some ideal conditions under which it can be planted. Moss prefers moisture and indirect (slightly shaded) sunlight. It is great for using as ground cover underneath taller growing trees and plants. If your only available location happens to be sunlight-heavy, don’t fret too much; your moss should still be able to grow well enough.   Moss is great for irrigating out areas of your yard that tend to flood in heavy rains. Plant it instead of grass to help endorse drainage in the soil. Moss doesn’t have a root system, so it can grow easily over rocky soil that grass wouldn’t otherwise be able to cover.  If you’re planting in soil, loosen the soil by taking a garden rake and plowing it until it is fine and soft. You should be able to easily pick up handfuls of loose soil. Test the soil pH and make changes if necessary; moss prefers acidic soil with a pH between 5 and 5.5. Clear any plants or weeds beforehand. If you’re planting in soil or over a flat surface, make sure the surface is smoothed and totally flat. Unlike grass, moss will show small divots and holes in the ground or area it is planted., Use a hose or sprinkler to heavily water the area you plan on planting your moss. Then, place each selection of moss onto the area with a firm hand. Press the moss down into soil/onto rocky patches to get it situated and to keep it from moving away.  After first planting the moss, it should be watered daily for 2-3 weeks. This will help to increase its growth and to keep it in place. A sprinkler head or hose with a very fine nozzle that mists the moss is much better than direct water pressure, which may damage the plants. Alternatively, you can use a very gentle irrigation system to continually water it.If the moss begins to appear dark green or patchy over time, it is likely receiving too much water. You can lessen the watering after a month or so, but the moss should be kept moist whenever possible.  One method of propagating moss is by dividing an existing piece into ¼ inch sections, and replanting them spaced apart. Break up a piece of moss into smaller pieces, and replant them near each other with about 1” of spacing between each piece.   This method only works if you’re planting moss in soil; trying to accomplish this on objects will be much more difficult as the small bits of moss are less likely to stick.  No, not to drink. Create a super-growth moss mixture by blending up moss into a liquid that can be spread onto objects and vertical items - such as walls, rocks, planters, and trees. Fill an old blender with a large piece of moss, two cups of buttermilk, and two cups of water. Blend the mixture until it has the consistency of a traditional milkshake.   This concoction does not have the greatest scent, so try to make it outdoors to avoid smelling up your home.You can use moss that is dead or alive for this, and both will work in growing new moss.  Coat your desired objects/garden plot with the moss milkshake. You can pour it directly onto things, use a paintbrush, or a spray bottle to get it spread out. Although not as visually appealing, you can spread this mixture onto the ground rather than planting live bits of moss. , If you don't have non-safety aspirin, soak the pills in a little water until the coating can be peeled off, and pour the whole thing into a blender.  The mixture should be a little chunky, and not super pourable.  This is not a great method for bare rocks, but works well around the bases of plants.	Choose a type of moss. Pick out your moss from a nursery. Get a moss starter from another garden or the woods. Select an ideal plot. Prepare the planting location. Plant the moss. Water the moss. Divide and spread the moss. Make a moss milkshake. Spread your milkshake. Get your moss.  , Place a large chunk of moss, a cup of water, and two non-safety coated aspirin. Blend. Spread on a substrate. Wait for moss to grow.
For this project you will need a pack of emoji stickers, scissors, a sewing needle, a file folder, and two matching stud earrings (with backs).; , Then, rip a piece of the file folder off. When you've done this, stick your emoji stickers on the piece of the file folder.  Carefully cut around all the details of the sticker, and be sure not to cut the sticker itself. Leave a little space at the top of your sticker where the earring will go.  Do this with both emoji stickers.  They should fit inside and be stopped by the gem or bead at the end of the stud earring. Insert into your ear, fasten with the earring back and then you're done!	Gather your supplies. Choose the emoji stickers you want to use. Cut out the pieces of the file folder with your emoji stickers on it. When you've cut out your emojis, take your sewing needle and make a small hole in the little space at the top of your sticker. Insert the earrings where you poked the holes with the needle.
As a general rule, lining fabrics should be smooth, lightweight, and very flexible.Additionally, if the original dress fabric has any stretch, the lining material must have an equal amount to prevent the fit from becoming warped. Popular lining options include smooth-surfaced cotton blends such as Viole, Habutae, crepe, thin satins, and Georgette. Do not use Negative Weight fabrics, heavy fabrics, or taffeta, crinoline, or tulle as a lining. Negative weight fabrics will alter the form, heavy fabrics will restrict movement, add bulk and weight, taffeta will add unnecessary shape and bulk, and crinoline is harsh on skin, as well as tulle. Consider the color, too. If the dress fabric is sheer, the lining should match either your skin tone or the color of the dress. If the fabric is opaque, you can coordinate the color of the lining material as desired since it won't show through.; , The amount of material you'll need for the lining should roughly match the amount of material needed to make the original dress.   Only calculate the amount of necessary material based on the pattern pieces that will come into direct contact with your body: bodice, skirt, and sleeves. You do not need to include any facings, collars, cuffs, or waistbands. If you're working without a pattern, you'll need to measure the dimensions of the bodice, skirt, and sleeves to determine the required amount of lining fabric.  Trace the lining from the original pattern used to construct the main dress, but adjust the edges as needed to prevent the lining from hanging beyond the sides of the dress.Only trace the lining for the bodice, skirt, and sleeves (when applicable). Transfer any pattern markings, but do not include extra material for kick pleats. Do not trace lining for the facings, collars, cuffs, or waistbands. Since the lining must be slightly smaller than the dress, remove 1/8 inch (3 mm) from your lining seam allowance around all of the outer edges, minus any edges that will overlap. In other words, the bottom of the bodice and waistband of the skirt should retain their original seam allowances. Adjust the bottom hem of the skirt to be 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 cm to 2.5 cm) shorter than the main dress. When working without a pattern, trace the lining from the actual bodice, skirt, and sleeves (when applicable), creating separate pieces of lining for each separately attached portion of the dress. Add 1/8 inch (3 mm) seam allowance to the neckline, shoulders, zipper opening, and armholes (sleeveless dress only). Add 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance to the sides. Do not add any seam allowance to the skirt hem.  After tracing the lining pieces onto the material, use sewing shears or scissors to carefully cut out each one.   Before beginning, it's a a good idea to check the lining against the original dress. All pieces should match the form of the dress at all points, but the seam allowance and lower hem should be visibly shorter. If any of the lining pieces do not match, you'll need to redo them.  Before lining the dress, you should follow the original pattern instructions to complete everything except for the outer edges.   Leave the edges at the neck and shoulders raw, but finish the bottom hem. For sleeveless dresses, leave the armhole raw, too.  Follow the pattern instructions to stitch together the pieces of the lining as though making a separate dress.   Any edge left unfinished on the original dress (neck, shoulders, and armhole) should remain raw on the lining, as well. Leave the zipper opening unfinished, too. If the dress has any kick pleat or slit, you should also leave those edges unfinished.  Fold the raw edges of the lining under by 1/8 inch (3 mm) and press them in place using an iron.   Do not fold the neck and shoulder edge under. If the armholes were left raw, do not press them, either. Press the seam allowance for the zipper opening, along with the seam allowance for any kick pleats or skirt slits. Press any darts in the lining in the opposite direction of the darts in the dress to reduce the amount of bulk.  Arrange the lining pieces over the main dress. The right sides should face each other and the wrong sides should face out.   Verify that all key components line up correctly before pinning the lining in place. The lining waistband should match the dress waistband. The zipper opening of the lining should match the zipper opening of the dress, and you should pin the lining in place around that zipper.  Machine sew the lining to the main dress at the neckline and shoulders using a standard straight stitch.Follow the seam allowance indicated by the original pattern, but keep in mind that the seam allowance of the lining will be 1/8 inch (3 mm) shorter than that of the main fabric. After sewing the pieces together, notch the seam allowance and corners to reduce potential bulk.  Machine stitch the lining to the main dress around each armhole using a straight stitch.   For sleeveless dresses, you'll need to follow the seam allowance according to the instructions of the original pattern. For dresses with sleeves, stitch the lining to the dress directly over the matched seams. Pull the sleeve lining through the sleeves and let it hang loosely.  If the dress has separate bodice and skirt pieces, you should stitch the lining to the main fabric around the hemline.   Align the lining and main fabric so that the waist lines match. Stitch directly over the existing seams, stopping 1 inch (2.5 cm) before the zipper opening on either side.  Change the foot on your sewing machine to a zipper foot, then sew the lining to the dress around the zipper.Start at the top left side and sew straight down. To complete the right side, start at the bottom and sew straight up. Do not get too close to the bumps of the zipper while stitching the lining in place. If you do not have a zipper foot, you'll need to sew the zipper to the lining by hand, preferably using a fell stitch.  If the skirt had a slit, stitch the lining to the main dress around the perimeter of the slit.   On the other hand, if the dress has a kick pleat, finish the lining with a narrow hem around this area and let it hang free. Note that the bottom hem of the skirt should remain loose. You can also leave the outer edge of the sleeve loose, but if you would prefer secured sleeves, top stitch the outer edges of the sleeve together.  The lining should now be secure, so you can turn the dress right-side out again. This step completes the process.  Machine stitch the separate lining pieces together. When finished, you should have a duplicate dress form made from the lining.   Sew the sides together with a 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance, but use a seam allowance of 1/8 inch (3 mm) along the shoulders.  Hem the skirt of the lining with 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) seam allowance. Press and finish all of the other raw edges with 1/8 inch (3 mm) seam allowance.   Finish all other raw edges, including the neckline, zipper opening, armhole, sleeve opening, and any skirt slits.  Turn the dress inside-out but leave the lining right-side out. Slip the lining form over the dress form, matching the seams and edges precisely.   The only edge that should not match will be the lower hem, since the lining should be shorter than the original dress. Double-check to verify that the zipper and seams overlap properly before pinning them in place.  Machine stitch the lining to the dress at the neckline, shoulder seams, armholes, and waist seam.   Use a standard straight stitch for all topstitching. Instead of sewing directly over the existing seams, stitch 1/8 inch (3 mm) to the inside of each seam. If the dress has a slit in the skirt, topstitch the lining to the dress around the slit opening, as well. Leave the bottom hem of the skirt loose. Sleeve openings can remain loose, or you may wish to stitch them together, as well.  Switch to a zipper foot, then machine stitch the lining around the zipper.   Sew from top to bottom on the left side of the zipper and from bottom to top on the right side. Make sure that you do not get too close to the bumps of the zipper while working. Alternatively, you could hand stitch the lining to the zipper if you do not have a zipper foot. Use a fell stitch or similarly secure stitch.  The lining should be secure, so you can turn the dress right-side out again. Doing so completes the process.	Choose the right material. Purchase enough material. Adjust the original dress pattern. Cut out the lining pieces. Complete most of the main dress. Assemble the lining. Press the unmatched seams. Pin the right sides together. Stitch along the neckline and shoulders. Sew around the armholes. Attach the lining at the waist. Stitch along the zipper opening. Attach any remaining raw edges. Turn the dress and lining right-side out. Sew the lining pieces together. Press and hem the raw edges. Pin the wrong sides together. Topstitch along the connecting seams. Sew around the zipper. Turn the dress right-side out.
Storing batteries sealed in their packaging ensures that they remain protected from environmental factors such as humidity. It also ensures that you do not confuse new, fully charged batteries with older ones, and it prevents the terminals from coming into contact with other metals.; , Batteries of different types or from different manufacturers can react with each other, causing leakage or other damage. If you are storing disposable (non-rechargeable) batteries, avoid storing new and used batteries together.Separate containers are ideal. If you plan to use one container, place each type of battery in its own plastic bag.  Many rechargeable batteries will permanently damage themselves if kept in a discharged state. The ideal level of charge depends on the technology: Lead Acid Store at full charge to avoid sulfation, which lowers capacity.  Lithium Ion (Li-ion) For best results, store at 30–50% maximum charge.If you will be unable to recharge within a few months, store at full charge instead.Nickel-based (NiMH, NiZn, NiCd) Can be stored at any state of charge., In most cases, any cool room away from direct sun is fine. Even at relatively warm temperatures of 77ºF (25ºC), a typical battery only loses a few percent of its charge capacity each year. Storing batteries in the refrigerator (or anywhere between 34–60ºF / 1–15ºC) causes minor improvements in this area, but is not necessary unless you have no good alternative or maximum performance is vital. For most consumers, the refrigerator is not worth the risk of water damage and the inconvenience of waiting for batteries to warm up before use.Do not put a battery in a freezer unless the manufacturer recommends it.Traditional nickel-based batteries lose their charge quickly even at low temperatures. They recharge faster at cool temperatures, but not below 50ºF (10°C) for consumer-grade chargers.More recent LSD (Low Self-Discharge) NiMH batteries are designed to maintain their charge at room temperature.  Keep your batteries in a vapor-proof container if they are in a high-humidity environment or if there is risk of condensation (including in the fridge). Alkaline batteries can be safely stored in moderately humid conditions (35 to 65% relative humidity).Most other batteries prefer drier environments., Your batteries may start conducting electricity if they come into contact with metal. This will drain your batteries quickly, and create heat. Take steps to prevent this problem and reduce fire risk:Do not store batteries in a metal container. Use a sealed plastic container or a specialized battery storage box. Do not store coins or other metal objects in the same container. Align batteries so the positive terminals cannot contact the negative terminals of other batteries. Cover the terminals with masking tape or plastic caps if you cannot guarantee this.  Storing a lead-acid battery at a very low charge state can cause permanent crystal formation (sulfation) that reduces capacity.Lithium-ion batteries at low charge can develop copper structures that short the battery, making it dangerous to use.The exact recharge instructions depend on the battery design. Follow these guidelines if you do not have access to manufacturer instructions: Lead Acid Recharge to full whenever voltage drops below 2.07 volts / cell (12.42V for a 12V battery).One charge every six months is typical.Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Recharge to 30–50% capacity whenever voltage drops below 2.5 V/cell.Do not recharge if voltage drops to 1.5V/cell.One charge every few months is typical.  If your rechargeable batteries drop to low charge levels for more than a few days, they will likely require special treatment before you can use them again: Lead Acid The battery will usually recharge, but with permanently reduced capacity. If a small lead acid battery fails to recharge, apply a very low amount of current at a high voltage (~5V) for two hours.Anti-sulfation devices are not recommended without an experienced operator.Lithium Ion (Li-ion) The battery may enter "sleep mode" and fail to recharge. Use a charger with a "boost" feature, taking care to apply the voltage with the correct polarity. Never boost a battery that falls below 1.5V/cell for a week or more, as it is permanently damaged and dangerous to use.Nickel-based (NiMH, NiZn, NiCd) No major issues. Some types may require charging and fully discharging a couple times to return to full capacity.For large scale use, consider a battery analyzer that can "recondition" the battery.	Keep batteries in the original packaging if possible. Separate batteries by make and age. Check the charge levels on rechargeable batteries. Store your batteries at room temperature or below. Control humidity. Prevent electrical conduction. Recharge lead acid and lithium-ion batteries periodically. Restore discharged batteries.
Clean your side windows thoroughly, inside and out, using window cleaning solution and a squeegee. You may need to clean them two to three times to remove all the dirt. It is important to clean the glass carefully otherwise it will cause air bubbles on the film.           Remember to clean the gasket holding the window in place. Use a razor blade to scrape off any residue.  Unroll the film onto the inside of the window, liner side up (The sticky side is the film and the silk side is the liner). Trim the film to the approximate size of the window using a razor knife. Do this with extreme caution.           Always cut the film leaving at least one extra inch on each side, to ensure the entire window will be covered.  Position the film so that the straight bottom edge extends to 1 quarter inch below the top of the inside casket. Using the razor knife, trim the vertical edges of the film first. Then lower the window down to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) and trim the film to fit the shape of the top of the window.           Make sure to press the knife gently to avoid any damage of the glass. Accuracy with the trimming may require multiple tries to get desired shape.  Spray the inside of the window generously with application solution. Next, peel off the film liner and spray the exposed adhesive with application solution.  Carefully position the window film onto the glass, adhesive side facing the glass. Slide the film into place, starting at the bottom and working towards the top. The window should still be rolled down slightly.           Use a squeegee to press the film onto the glass, working from the middle out. Apply more and more pressure as you feel the film begin to grab the glass. Make sure there are no air bubbles. Roll up the window and continue placing the film into position on the bottom part of the window. Slip the end of the film underneath the window gasket. Push all the water and soap towards the edge of the window, and blot away using a squeegee wrapped in paper towel.	Clean windows. Measure and pre-cut the film. Trim the film. Apply the application solution. Apply tint to window.
Eggshells can be used to grow small seedlings indoors. When the seedling is ready to be planted outside, place the shell and seedling directly in the ground. The eggshell will decompose over time and help fertilize the soil.  Use large eggshells to start seeds indoors.        Poke pin holes in the bottom of half an eggshell.       Fill the eggshell half with soil.       Place a seed in the soil and cover lightly with soil.       Write on the eggshell the type of plant the seedling is. Use a pencil or permanent marker to write on the eggshell.       Store the eggshell seedling in an egg carton and place it in a windowsill. Water the seedling as needed.       Plant the seedling in the ground when the first set of leaves appear. Lightly crush the eggshell with your hand, and place the eggshell and seedling directly into the ground.; , Gardeners frequently add lime to compost to correct acidity problems in garden soil. Lime is made up of calcium carbonate, which is the main nutrient in eggshells. Rather than purchase lime, recycle eggshells to amend compost.   Crush eggshells and add them directly to the compost. To decrease the decomposition time, dry the eggshells in an oven and grind them using a blender before adding them to the compost.  Eggshells contain calcium, phosphorus, sulfur and potassium, which help make plants healthy.  Rinse eggshells. Allow the eggshells to dry, and place them in a bowl or large container.       Grind the eggshells using a pestle, which is a hand-held tool used for mashing or grinding substances. If you do not have a pestle, grind the eggshells in a blender. The smaller the eggshell pieces, the faster they will break down in the soil.       Add the shells to your garden and mix them into the soil.  The eggshells will add calcium to the soil in the containers, provide drainage and deter cutworms and slugs.   Place crushed eggshells in the bottom of empty pots before adding soil. Do not grind the eggshells, but crush them by hand so the shells are in pieces.  The abrasive, sharp edges of the eggshells keep snails and slugs from crossing the shells to get to the plants.   Crush eggshells into pieces. Do not grind the shells, but crush the shells by hand. The shells should have sharp, rough edges.       Scatter the crushed eggshells around plants affected by snails or slugs. For best results, place the eggshells in a circular pattern around the plants.  Egg heads are a fun and creative recycling activity for children.   Use large eggshells to make egg heads. Crack eggs in half and rinse the eggshells. Allow the eggshells to dry.       Draw a face on each eggshell using permanent markers or colored pencils. The faces can be funny or resemble characters or animals, such as one-eyed monsters or farm animals.       Fill the eggshell with soil and place grass seeds in the soil.       Create a stand for the eggshell. Cut a small strip of cardstock paper. Tape the ends of the paper together so it creates a circular stand for the eggshell. Be sure the strip isn't so wide that it obstructs the view of face on the eggshell.       Place the eggshell in the stand on a windowsill. Water as needed.       Wait for the grass to grow. The eggshell will begin to grow grass, which will resemble green hair. The growth rate for the grass depends on the type of grass seed, but typically begins between 4 and 7 days. Children may cut the grass for a shorter "hairstyle" or allow it grow long to resemble long spikes of hair.	Recycle eggshells to grow seedlings. Use eggshells to improve compost. Recycle eggshells as fertilizer for the garden. Add eggshells to the bottom of garden containers and pots. Use recycled eggshells to deter snails and slugs. Create egg heads with grass hair.
Prius cars are too expensive to make a minor mistake. Learn what makes this car much different from other cars on the road of the present day. Perhaps is the statement from Toyota that said that this car is the most efficient car on the road that makes your face smile to pieces, or maybe it's something else that this car has that no other car on the road has that makes you smile from ear to ear.; , Explore your options. Although some people can afford a Toyota Prius, there are some that can't and need other options, even after test-driving the vehicle.  See if it has the right fit for you. Most salespeople from the Toyota brand will want to strap into the car when you decide to take the test drive of the Prius. The Prius is an easy car for the dealer to lose, and they don't want you leaving the dealership lot without them inside the car (should you want to gallivant for a short drive away).   Test out the placement of the pedals and see if the distance between the pedals fits your driving style. Have the dealer salesperson explain how the Prius manages its gas with its gas-electric engine from the Energy Consumption screen when stopped at a traffic light. They either may do it without even asking, or you may need to prompt them to remind them that it's one of those things all dealers should discuss during the test drive.  If you are currently driving a certified used pre-owned Prius, get to know the specs of miles per gallon differences in city/town driving.  If you feel the car can easily adapt to become your new car, discuss the terms of payment with the dealer salesperson. Recognize that buying a Prius is a long-term commitment you must make, and a transition that can be tough to adapt to (unless you are "rolling in money").  Plan on leasing the car, if you don't have the complete full amount due upon signing. Look for alternative payment options, along with selling your current car on a trade-in book value (every little bit helps).  Leasing the car may make the bank own the car, but you'll be able to keep it in your driveway (as long as you can make the payments) during the time. Don't forget about the taxes on each payment of the lease.  Give the Toyota salesman your name and address, and all payment details. Specify which color car you want, along with the customization packages you want to include in the car's purchase (as this may increase the value of price, but add to the usable amount of stuff your Prius can do for you in the end).  If they say that you can take the Prius when you walk out, good. Most times (especially for those new Priuses), they'll have to locate the customizations you've ordered on the order form, along with the color car you chose from the sales brochure, which could take a few days to a week or two, but it's waiting time well spent to get the right fit for your car.  Depending on conditions of pre-owned or new, this can increase the time waiting for the car to be shipped to your dealer.	Do your research well. Bring your current trade-in car to a Toyota dealership. Test drive a Prius. Have the dealer explain some of the other features of the Prius you are currently driving. Take it back to the dealership. Plan if you will be able to afford the car in the upcoming months to years. Have a co-signer there when you start the lease/loan. Follow all directions to purchase the car. Say goodbye to the sales-fellow, as you walk out of the dealership happy. Wait for the car to either be cleaned up or shipped to the dealership.
Anything that you remember about it is worth detailing. The librarian may be able to assist with looking for the book using a card file or may now search using the library computer. Sometimes the librarian knows the book.; , Hopefully, one of the books will be the lost book.  Do a search by topic. A trip to a used bookstore is another way to search for a lost book. Look through various book titles in the children's section.  They may remember the title which is all you need to know. Your parents might remember too as they will have read stories to you, or might even have kept copies of your books.  The Internet is a great source. Try using Google and type in the part that you remember, or part of that, in double quotes. A correct return might just happen!	Contact the librarianand describe the storyline as best you can. Select a few books that look like good candidates and check them out. Do a search at an online bookstore. Ask members of your family to help search for the book. Go surfing.
Type the following formula into cell F2: =((B2/C2)^(1/D2))^E2-1. The average growth rate of an investment will now appear in cell F2 whenever values are entered into cells B2 through E2.	Enter the formula for calculating the annualized yield rate.
Exercise is one of the best ways to improve your lung capacity and your ability to control your breathing. The type of exercise that’s right for you depends on the equipment available to you as well as your limitations. For instance, if you have bad knees, running can cause pain and damage to these vulnerable joints.Some options for cardiovascular exercise include:   Swimming Cycling Rowing  , Not warming up properly can lead to a host of injuries, such as pulled muscles and sprained ankles.Perform a light cardiovascular exercise (such as jumping jacks) and stretch.  This means you’re pushing yourself as hard as you can for the entire 20 seconds. Rather than performing low impact cardiovascular training for extended periods of time, you’ll want to use high intensity interval training (HIIT). While both are effective for improving your lung capacity, HIIT workouts are more efficient as they’re usually completed in a fraction of the time.If you’re already in good physical shape, you can increase your work time to 30 or 40 seconds for a more strenuous workout. If swimming, be careful not to push yourself too hard as you could risk drowning.  After your 20 seconds of work, lower your pace to a point where you’re able to talk and catch your breath. For instance, if you’re running, you’ll slow to a light jog for 40 seconds. The pace should be just enough to keep your heart rate going while still giving you a chance to recover.   If you’re in good physical shape, try decreasing your recovery time to 30 or 20 seconds.  The total workout should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.Start by doing this workout a few times a week, and you should notice your lung capacity and breathing improve.	Choose the right cardiovascular exercise. Warm up and stretch before exercising. Sprint, nonstop, for 20 seconds. Slow down and recover for 40 seconds. Repeat this sequence 10 times.
Look for silver-and-blue myki machines at Melbourne railway stations, major tram superstops, and major bus interchanges. Once you've found a machine, place your myki into the myki groove. The machine will immediately go into "quick top up" mode. Insert coins or notes up to the monetary amount that you want to load onto your card. Then, tap "OKAY" to complete the transaction and remove your myki card.   If you want to top up with a myki pass, return to the main menu and choose "Top up myki pass." If topping up with a credit or Eftpos card, make sure to insert your card when requested. Do not remove your card until the eftpos screen advises to remove it. If you use your card, you will receive a transaction record even if you select "No" to a receipt. If you select "Yes," then you'll receive a tax invoice as well. You will be asked if you want a receipt. Choose the appropriate option. Take your change and receipt from the slot below.  Bus drivers in regional towns can add funds to your card using the card-reading computers on their buses. If the bus driver cannot add the funds, then you'll need to find another way.  Add funds remotely by calling 13MYKI (1800 800 007) and following the automated payment procedure. Top up online at . Be aware that these options are always slower than topping up at a machine. Phone and online orders usually take at least overnight to process, and they can take even longer., This is a great way to save money if you regularly travel by public transport. You can buy a 7-day myki pass, or you can select a pass for anywhere between 28 and 365 consecutive days of riding. Buy a myki pass online, over the phone, or at any top-up station.	Use a myki machine. Ask a bus driver. Top up online or by phone. Consider buying a myki pass.
These can be helpful during the process. Some are listed below.   VO = voice over OC = off camera OS = off screen Pre Production = The process of getting things together before the making of the film Production = The making of the film Post Production = The editing process after the film is complete Distribution = The process of distributing your movie into theaters or stores; , A good (and common) program to use to make a screenplay is Microsoft Word (though you could handwrite it, it would be easier to type). People with high budgets often hire a screen writer to do this part, however, if you have no budget, then it would be good for you to come up with the ideas and have your friends help you out. To create a screenplay, first you want to come up with an idea. Let your imagination run free.   Make sure to come up with something interesting that still shows what genre you're displaying. Create a scene title. An example of a correctly formatted title is: INT. BEDROOM SCENE- EARLY AFTERNOON. "INT." means inside, but you can also use "EXT." which means outside. Label the name of your scene. Above, the label was "Bedroom Scene". Add a dash and state what time of day it is. If you want to go even further you can also add a time, by adding another dash and a specific time (such as "INT. BEDROOM SCENE- EARLY AFTERNOON- 1:15"). Move onto the next line. If your character is performing an action before he/she speaks, type that first.  A good font to type the character's name, actions, and dialogue in is Courier New at 12 pt.   Center what you're typing. Type the character's first and last name. After you have their name typed in, move down a line and start typing their dialogue, or "what they're supposed to say". If they have an action after that, start a new line, un-center what you're typing, and type the action in. Keep typing character actions and dialogue until you change scenes. Repeat the process of writing scenes until you are finished with your screenplay. The format for writing scenes is:  Scene Heading Character Name Dialogue Action or Notes for the scene    , That way, you won't have to think about that on the spot.  You'll want to be as prepared as you can.  Sometimes people get tired of the project, things go wrong, or it starts out great but soon people start to forget about it. The cast could be exactly as you pictured, but there could still be some that aren't dedicated enough to do as you ask. , A few of the angles are:   Wide Shot Medium Shot Close Up Dolly Shot Aerial Shot Arc Shot Dutch Tilt Long Shot Deep Focus For an explanation of the angles, go to: , The cast has to be able to feel what the character is feeling and respond like that particular character would respond. Wardrobe, makeup, and hair may bring out the look of the character but it needs the feelings to get the job done. #* A good exercise for this is to have them act like that character for a day.    SFX stands for "special effects". Now this is usually the things done "in camera" meaning if you, for example, put a prosthetic arm on your cast member and have another person rip it off and have blood splatter everywhere, that's SFX. It can be the easier of the two. VFX is done on the editing software on your computer.	Learn some basic terms. Begin creating a screenplay (also known as a script). Know all the locations you want to film at. Have a cast, a camera, your screenplay, props, wardrobe, hair and makeup, and a schedule to start your production process. Know that production might be one of the hardest parts of the film. Once you have everything planned, shoot your film!  , Shoot at multiple angles to make your film more professional. Make sure your bring out the story. Know the difference between SFX and VFX.

Stir until most of the Epsom salt has dissolved into the water.  Clear glue will result in a brighter color of slime than will white glue.          Remember to choose non-toxic glue if small children will be involved.  Stir the mixture to combine and continue stirring until the desired consistency is achieved.          Highlighter ink can be an alternative to craft paint. Simply pull the bottom off a highlighter and drop the ink filament into the slime mixture. Using gloves, squeeze the ink filament to get the ink out. Be aware, though, that highlighter ink may only glow under a blacklight.  Enjoy your glow-in-the-dark slime!	Combine the water and Epsom salt in a medium bowl. Add the liquid glue and stir to combine. Add the craft paint. Finished!
The more locks, the better!; , Don't "hide" your spare key above the door-frame or under the doormat. Instead, put it someplace less obvious.  These can be purchased, or you can make them yourself.  This will make them impossible to open. Just hope they don't break the window.  This will give a potential-intruder the impression that somebody is home. A burglar is less likely to enter a home if he or she thinks that there's a chance of being caught, arrested, or hurt in the process.  Baseball bats and sharp sticks work well. Firearms work well, too, as they are effective even from a distance; but keep in mind that owning a firearm creates a whole new set of risks. Be sure that you know what you are doing if you opt to keep firearms around your house, and keep them well out of the way of young children.     Remember that even your own weapons can be taken from you, and used against you. Above all, be careful, and be sure that you receive proper training.  This will alert you to whether or not anybody is opening your doors and windows without you knowing. If someone is periodically entering your home, there's a good chance that they'll attempt to do so again. , A tripwire is a string or fishing line, tied to a stick or a pole just above the ground, that causes a passerby to trip. These are often placed at the tops of staircases. Attaching noise-making devices (e.g. bells, chimes, etc.) to the tripwires will audibly warn you of intruders.  Dogs are great pets, but they can also be great security systems.  Tape the tacks onto the top of the fence, facing upwards. If an unsuspecting intruder grabs the top of the fence, he will get a handful of tacks. This will injure him, dissuade him from attempting to do the same thing again, and probably make him wonder what other sorts of booby traps you might have set up around your house.	Buy a deadbolt for your door. If you have a spare key, be sure that it's well-hidden. Look for long rods that you can jam in-between your doorknob and floor below, thus preventing intruders from being able to open the door from the outside while in place. If you have sliding-glass doors, or windows that slide open, insert broom handles or long pieces of wood at the base of each door and window, along the track that your door or window slides on. Put a lamp or light on a timer, so that it turns on and off even when you are not home. Consider keeping weapons around your home, just in case you need to defend yourself. Put tape on your doors and windows. Buy small, screw-type locks for your sliding windows, in order to prevent intruders from opening your windows all the way.  , Consider setting up some tripwires. Consider getting a guard dog or watchdog. If you are worried about somebody hopping over your back fence, buy some clear packing tape and a box of thumbtacks.
The dogwood should still be in a dormant state when you remove branches. Sawing or otherwise removing branches during the late spring or summer, after the tree begins to actively grow, can create fresh, appealing entry spots for insects that like to bore into the wood of the tree.; , Wood that is dying or dead will do nothing good for your tree. In fact, leaving it on the tree may actually cause problems. Deadwood is more likely to grow mold or other fungi, which can then spread to healthy parts of the dogwood.  Like dead branches, diseased branches will only invite further infection to the rest of your dogwood. When cutting off noticeably diseased branches, you should dip the shears or saw into a solution made of one part bleach and three parts water to sterilize them. Otherwise, you may accidentally spread the disease to other parts of the tree.  You can either cut back the old stems on these dogwoods or cut them down completely. For shrubby dogwoods, you can actually cut the dogwood down to the ground every few years to remove old stems and encourage the growth of new twigs.  If a particular section of your dogwood tree seems abnormally thick or crowded, select the weakest branches from that spot and cut them back to their point of origin.  A branch that grows beneath the grafting point will have characteristics of one of the original trees used for the hybrid, rather than the hybrid dogwood itself. To keep the foliage and appearance of the tree consistent, you should remove these unexpected branches by sawing or pruning them off at the point of origin.  Sometimes, the lowest branches of the dogwood can interfere with walking or other gardening activities. Other times, the branches hang so low that the underside of the tree does not receive enough air. In either case, the lowest branches can be sawed off or cut away with heavy-duty shears.	Remove branches during the winter or early spring. Remove deadwood. Cut off diseased or insect-infested branches. Prune away old, twiggy stems.Some dogwood varieties, particularly the shrubby types, are valued mostly for the colorful bark that grows on new stems. Thin out crowded areas. Remove shoots that grow below the graft point.Some hybrid or variegated dogwood varieties are created by grafting together two separate dogwood trees. Determine whether or not you need to remove lower branches.
You need to get a good idea of their style, so that when you go out shopping for clothes you already know what you want to buy.; , 5SOS usually wear muted tones and dark colours, like black, white, red, green and blue.  It doesn't matter what quality they are, whether they are perfect or have holes in the knees: you just need at least one pair of skinny jeans. If you can get black ones, even better!  , Most of the time, the guys are either wearing plain shirts or band shirts. Some bands that 5SOS have been spotted wearing the merchandise of are: The Misfits, Metallica, Green Day, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Nirvana, The Sex Pistols, and more. Dark shirts with slogans on are also worn a lot. Don't wear the shirts of any bands that you don't listen to, as you will be criticised for this.  Flannel shirts have become very popular recently, especially among teenage girls. They can be worn in all sorts of ways: unbuttoned, buttoned up, over-sized, tied around the waist, or however you feel comfortable. Remember to incorporate some of your own personal style into your outfits.  Converse, Vans, boots and similar shoes will be fine. Your outfit should give off a kind of "I don't care" look so make sure you have the walk and attitude to pull that off. Never be mean to anyone, however.  You can really go for whatever you want. Black dresses would also be a good choice.  This jacket helps keep the look together without ruining anything.  Wear whatever you want to wear and don't let anyone judge you. The guys have learned this recently, and have gone with more bold outfits.	Look at images of the band online. Wear the right colors. Wear a pair of skinny jeans. Wear band shirts. Wear flannel shirts. Wear black or brown shoes. When dressing formally, opt for a black shirt and some nice pants and shoes. When it gets cold, your best option will be a leather jacket. Be yourself!
Every state has an agency called either the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Motor Vehicle Bureau, or some other similar name. Whatever the name, this will be the agency that controls your car registration. A quick Internet search for “car registration” and “<State Name>” will probably get you right where you need to go.; , The official web site will usually tell you all the documents that you will need to provide to register your vehicle.  If you cannot find all the answers that you need online, or if you still have questions that remain unanswered, locate the telephone number for the office nearest to you and call for assistance.  In most states, you will need to bring the Title Certificate or some other proof of ownership., This is mostly likely your current driver’s license, or some other identification card., An acceptable bill of sale must generally include a description of the make and model of the car, the car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), date of sale, purchase price, and the names of the both the seller and buyer., You will need to check with the agency ahead of time to find out just what form of proof of insurance they require. Some will have a particular form; some will require a sticker, seal or stamp. Some will have certain timelines that the proof of insurance can be no more than a certain amount of time before the date of the registration. Plan ahead and follow the instructions., An inspection is not required in all states, while other states may require very thorough inspections. Make sure you know what is required in your state. , Most states require a completed registration application form, which you can print from the web site or pick up in a registry office.  Be sure to complete the portions of the form that apply to what you wish to do. The New York State form, for example, uses a single form to Register a Vehicle, Change a Registration, Renew a Registration, Replace Lost or Damaged Registration, Get a Title Only, and Transfer Plates. Make sure that you mark only what you need., Omitting information, or writing illegibly, will delay your application or could create errors on your registration form., You will be asked to describe the year, make and model of the car, and provide the VIN. Be careful to provide this accurately. Errors on the application form can lead to errors on the final registration, which can be difficult to correct later., Many states have a service that will allow you to submit your paperwork for registration through their web site.   For example, New York has an “E-Z Visit” service that will let you start your application online, which will then reduce the time you need to spend at the registry office.Another example, Pennsylvania will let you renew your registration online, as long as you meet certain qualifications.You will want to check your own state’s site to learn your options.  Use the state’s web site to locate the registry office that is closest to you. You may also be able to find out if appointment times are available, to reduce your wait time at the office. Take your completed forms and payment for all required fees to the office.  The registration fee is based on the value of the vehicle that you are registering. You may not know the exact amount of the fee before going to the office, but you can find out ahead of time what forms of payment are accepted. Most offices will accept cash, checks, money orders, or credit and debit cards. You should check with the office ahead of time to confirm which methods of payment will be acceptable and to get an estimate of the amount of the fee.  States require various frequency levels for registration renewals. Some will have to renew every year, while others are less frequent. There will be a fee for renewal, and most renewals can happen online or through the mail. While in-person registrations are necessary initially, renewals are quicker and require less paperwork.  Keep copies of all registration materials, renewals, and fees paid. This will provide proof of registration and save time when the renewal date approaches on a regular basis.  With each registration renewal, many states provide a stamp, sticker or decal to affix to your license plate. If you forget to apply this when it arrives, you may be stopped and ticketed for having an expired registration.	Start at the source. Review the web site. Call the office for personal assistance. Bring proof of ownership. Be prepared to show proof of identification. Bring proof of Sale. Have proof of insurance. Have proof of inspection. Print the form. Complete the form carefully. Complete all the identifying information carefully and completely. Provide all requested information about the vehicle. Find out if you can register online. Register in person. Call ahead about fee payment. Keep up with registration renewals. Keep organized files. Keep your license plates current.
The better the guitar, the better the sound. And that means it will be easier and more fun to learn on. That said, it isn't at all necessary to go out and spend tons of money on a nice axe. Don't spend less than $200. There are a lot of poorly made beginner models out there that could just end up leaving you frustrated.   For Rock, an entry level Epiphone (by Gibson) or Squier (by Fender) model guitar is a good idea to start with. If your budget can handle it, Fender and Gibson have famous names on the headstock. They make instruments the way they made them in the 50s, 60s and 70s. For metal, some good brands are B.C. Rich, DBZ, Dean, ESP, Jackson, and Ibanez. If you're old school, Gibson and Fender clones can also be used for metal. Now, you may be asking: what's the difference between a rock guitar and a metal guitar? The most important difference is in the pickups. Heavy metal guitars tend to have "active pickups", while rock guitars usually have "passive pickups". Go ahead and look up the difference. Remember, just because a guitar has passive pickups doesn't mean you cannot play metal with it. Vice versa, just because a guitar has active pickups doesn't mean you can't play rock with it.; , Get something small (no more than about 30 watts, no less than 10) to practice with, and spend no more than 100 dollars on it. It should be a "combo amp". You don't need to pay much heed to this term, but if you're curious, look it up elsewhere. Anyway, you can move to higher-end models later once you are more experienced. Line 6, Crate, Epiphone, Fender, all make decent entry level amps. Fender, Vox, and Marshall make higher-end tube amps, among other companies as well. Read on to find out what the difference between tube and solid-state amps is.   There are two types of amps: Solid-state and Tube. Solid-state amplifiers are much, MUCH cheaper, and are recommended for a beginner. However, some metalcore and metalcore guitarists prefer solid-state amps because they can sound very harsh (doesn't always apply to cheap entry-level amps). Tube amps (also known as "valve" amps, especially in the UK) are frequently used by professional rock musicians, and a large percentage of heavy metal players use tube as well. Unfortunately for the beginner, they much more expensive than solid-state amps. Tube-driven amps are widely considered to sound highly superior to solid-state amps. They are definitely not recommended for a beginner, as they do require maintenance and care must be taken when using them; they are quite fragile and can be costly to repair.  Special note: Some amps use a combination of Tube and Solid-State technology. They are often a good choice for the amateur guitarist who has moved beyond the beginner level. They sound far superior to entry-level Solid-State amps and are a lot cheaper than fully Tube amplifiers. Another special note: "tube" does NOT refer to the shape of the amp.  Get lots and lots of these. You're going to be losing them, I promise. No guitarist can avoid that, so have backups. Get some with a thin to medium thickness and some that are heavier. You will probably find you like one more than the other. Once you have found a preference, buy primarily that type of picks. Jim Dunlop makes great picks of all thickness.  Guitars are nothing without good strings. Investing in these will produce awe-inspiring sound.   D'Addario and Ernie Ball strings are the most commonly used strings for both rock AND heavy metal. It's mostly a matter of personal preference. Keep in mind the string gauge when buying strings. String gauge refers to how thick the strings are. When people refer to string gauges, they usually use the gauge of the high E string (the 1st string). For example, if you buy strings that are .009 gauge, that means that the 1st string gauge is .009 inches (0.0 cm) thick. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Strings#Electric_Guitar for an accurate list of string gauges. The thicker the string gauge, the more bass you can hear and powerful-sounding the strings will be, but it will be more difficult to do string bends. A string bend is when you bend the string so you can change the pitch of the note. The thinner the string gauge, the easier it will be to do string bends, but the strings will sound more like treble. Make sure you try many different kinds so you can figure out what suits you best.  Tablature is a system that uses numbers to represent positions on the fretboard. Remember, the 1st string is the one closest to your feet when you play, and the 6th string is closest to your head.   The long lines represent the strings:  E (1st)--------------------------------------------- B (2nd)--------------------------------------------- G (3rd)--------------------------------------------- D (4th)--------------------------------------------- A (5th)--------------------------------------------- E (6th)---------------------------------------------    , Here is a tablature staff telling you to play a note at the 3rd fret on the 6th string, then a note at the 6th fret on the same string, then a note on the 3rd fret of the 5th string, and finally two notes together - 2nd fret 4th string and the fifth string open (not fretting any note). Whenever notes are shown directly over or under other notes, all of them are played together as a chord.   E (1st)--------------------------------------------- B (2nd)--------------------------------------------- G (3rd)--------------------------------------------- D (4th)-------2------------------------------------- A (5th)-----3-0------------------------------------- E (6th)-3-6-----------------------------------------  , If you don't know how to tune the guitar, buy a tuner. Everybody uses them anyway, because tuning by ear is impossible for a beginner. If you cannot get a tuner, use a pitch pipe or some point of reference to:   Tune the fifth string to A. Then match the sound of the 5th fret on the 6th string to the open A. Match the D string to the 5th fret of the 5th string. Match the G string to the 5th fret of the 4th string. Match the B string to the 4th fret of the 3rd string. Match the high E string to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.  Key, is a big mystery to a lot of beginners. It's going to remain one too - because we aren't going into the swamp of music theory here. Next is this nifty chart which will tell you what fret (position) you can play your pentatonic scale at over any chord and stay in key. If this confuses you, remember that the scale starts on the 6th string, and the first note in the pattern is the root. Even if you skip the 6th string and start playing on the 4th, whatever fret you started on is your position.

Take out the dipstick, which will be red, orange, or yellow. You should not need to remove the oil cap itself to check the dipstick. Wipe off any oil with a rag or paper towel so you can see the mark that indicates the proper oil level. "Dip" the stick into the oil reservoir and then take it back out. Look to see if the oil on the stick reaches the oil level mark.   It is ideal to check your oil once a week. Add oil if the crankcase is low or empty. Continue checking every 30 minutes. Rapidly leaking oil could mean there is a hole in your oil pan.; , The combination of an ultraviolet (UV) or blue light and fluorescent dyes allows you to find small oil leaks. Add the dye to your oil reservoir and let your engine idle for 10 minutes. With the overhead lights off, shine the fluorescent light over your engine. Glowing areas indicate leaks.  Wrap packing cellophane around the connectors, sensors and wiring harnesses and secure with duct tape. Spray degreaser on your engine, chassis and suspension and let sit for the time specified in the instructions. Using a steam cleaner, eliminate any grease or hardened dirt. Dry electrical components and sensors with compressed air.  Drive your car for about 15 minutes. If there is oil on the surface, it will appear in the powder, allowing you to see its point of origin.  Multiple oil leaks can be present due to natural wear of the seals used to retain the oil. It is not uncommon for valve cover gaskets, cam seals, and oil pan gaskets leak at the same time. All the rubber seals that retain fluid on an engine are exposed to the same heating and cooling of the engine, and may fail one at a time or all together.	Check your oil. Use a fluorescent leak detection system. Consider "steam cleaning" your engine to make it easier to spot oil leaks. Apply a thin coating of talcum powder around the engine. Look for multiple leaks.
The first thing you should do is to clear up the area around your Rose Bush. Weeds growing around your Rose Bush may be sucking up all the nutrients in the soil.   Fallen leaves and flowers should be picked up by hand instead of raked. Raking “disrupts” the soil and may expose weed seeds to sunlight, therefore urging them to sprout. Always remove any dead flowers and fallen leaves from the ground around your Rose Bush. These may look harmless, but if they get wet and do not dry properly, mold will fester and may infect your Rose Bush.; , Dead flowers and leaves that are still attached to the rose bush can either be plucked off or pruned using shears as closest to the cane as possible.  Weeds around your rose bush should also be removed. Make sure you have a firm grasp of the weed, as close to the roots as possible and give it a good tug. Roots should be removed or else they will sprout again in as little as a matter of days.  You should consider pruning your rose bush as soon as the weather starts to warm up—usually right after the last frost so that your rose bush is not at risk of being damaged by another frost or sudden rise in temperature.   You should also prune your rose bush when the buds start to swell. Check your rose bush for signs of new leaf growth and if the buds are starting to grow red in color. Sometimes, pruning depends on the type of rose you have. There are some roses that require pruning while dormant, whilst other roses require pruning after they bloom. A rose bush should be pruned while it's dormant if you notice that it produces new growth in the spring and the blooms come from this new growth. However, if the blooms come from the old canes, then it should be pruned after it blooms instead.  You do not want to cause more harm to the canes by using blunt shears. Also try to avoid cutting at a straight line. Instead, try cutting at an angle because it will help the cane heal quicker.   Don't hesitate to cut off the all dead and diseased looking canes in your Rose Bush, before it starts infecting the healthy ones. Also prune old canes to allow new growth  , Prune the center of the bush to allow maximum air circulation to prevent fungi growth due to accumulating moisture. This also allows for better exposure to the sun. Prune the growth on main canes that don't grow to a reasonable thickness. If the growth is no thicker than a pencil, then it should be pruned.   Prune old and dead canes down to where it meets fresh ones. You can tell that a cane is dead or diseased if it has dead leaves and is “woody”, characterized by a dried and brown appearance.  You can tell if a bush is overgrown if it looks like a huge shrub of intertwined canes—basically a tangled mess. Most overgrown bushes will have dead canes and unproductive canes. Don't hesitate to prune as many canes as needed.  To get your Rose Bush back to it's healthy state, make sure to provide adequate nutrients to your soil. Water the soil thoroughly before spreading the ingredients evenly around the bush up to the outer perimeter. Afterward, water again. To make a nutrient-rich soil feed:   1 cup bone meal or super phosphate 1 cup cottonseed meal ½ cup blood meal ½ fish meal ½ Epsom salt (magnesium sulphate)  , Most people fertilize their rose bush at the start of spring, however, if you notice new growth in your rose bush, you can start giving it fertilizer even if it's a bit early. Your rose bush will require more nutrition when it is growing and budding.   During the peak growing season, fertilize your rose bush every 4-6 weeks.  Watering it before applying fertilizer prevents the fertilizer from burning your plant.  If the fertilizer is allowed to come into contact with your plant’s leaves, the fertilizer will burn the leaves and cause them to wilt. Because of this, make sure that you keep the fertilizer at the base of the plant.  This will allow the soil to retain more moisture for the roots and discourage weed growth, which will compete with your Rose Bush for nutrients and moisture.   If the area around your rose bush has a good drainage, you can apply 2–4 inch (5.1–10.2 cm) layer of mulch. If the drainage is poor, a thinner layer should be used. This is to make sure that your rose bush does not drown in too much water.  The newspaper or cardboard mulching technique is highly recommended for those with extreme weed problems. This is done by placing a layer of newspaper or cardboard the whole area of soil and adding a top layer of mulch. This is to prevent any weed seeds from being exposed to the sun as to avoid allowing them to sprout.  During the summer or if you live somewhere where the temperature reaches 90 degrees, it is recommended that you water your rose bush for 15 minutes straight, daily. During the winter, you can just water your Rose Bush every other day.	Clear up the area around your rose bush. Inspect your rose for dead flowers and remove them. Remove weeds around your rose bush. Prune your rose bush. Use proper pruning shears and make sure that they’re sharp. Know where to prune your rose. Prune an overgrown rose bush. Add nutrients to your soil. Know that you can fertilize before spring arrives if need be. Make sure to water your rose bush before and after giving it fertilizer. Add fertilizer directly to the base of the plan. Cover the area around your Rose Bush with at least an inch or two of mulch. Try a newspaper mulch if you have weed problems. Make sure to water your Rose Bush adequately.
Your approach to an album theme can be as loose or elaborate as you like, but some kind of theme is necessary to make your album cohesive.It can be as simple as creating a lyrical theme that fuses the songs together, or you can go all out with a deep-rooted concept album that tells a story through song.   For example, a loose theme could focus on a specific emotion, one of the four elements, a particular event that affected you or your own social commentary.To get an idea of how concept albums work, reference The Wall by Pink Floyd, Mothership Connection by Parliament, Pet Sounds by Beach Boys, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars by David Bowie, The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra by Sun Ra, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back by Public Enemy and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles.Before you start writing songs, spend some time reflecting. Keep a journal and write down your thoughts and ideas as they come to you.; , Chances are, you have songs written that you haven’t done anything with yet. Look closely at those songs – are there any connecting lyrical or melodic themes? Are they strong enough to build your album on?   At the very least, these songs might inspire new ideas, or jumpstart a concept you already have in mind. Consider already-written material for your album. Work on building a repertoire of solid songs that you don’t necessarily have a plan for yet.  During the writing phase, don’t aim for perfection or fully realized songs. You can perfect the songs later. For now, explore ideas and make room for inspiration to strike. As you work on the songs, also work toward developing your own unique sound.   Inspiration can come at any time, so be prepared. Carry a pen and notebook with you everywhere. Use a voice recorder app on your phone to capture lyric or melody ideas on the fly.Don’t try to force the songs. If you get stuck on one, put that song away and start work on another one. You can come back to it later with fresh eyes and ears., Organize specific times for practicing and stick to that schedule as closely as you can. Consistent practicing will help you hone your craft.You’ll also get more comfortable with your material and your new songs will fully develop. Take note of any changes or variations that happen spontaneously while you’re practicing.   Think about why these variations might be happening. Do you need to rehearse more to work that kink out, or should that change be incorporated into the song? Don’t be afraid to change your songs based on what comes out naturally while you’re practicing. Allow them to develop organically.  Pay attention to their reactions and get feedback from trustworthy people in the crowd.   Use gigs as opportunities to improve and refine your songs.  If you are the front person or the main songwriter of a band, it can be difficult to relinquish full control. However, you have to give your bandmates room to interpret your vision while still putting their unique spin on the sound. Allow room for their creative juices to flow.   Respect the suggestions and input of your bandmates. The songs will be better for it.  After honing in on what you envision as the thematic heart of your album, explore your concept more deeply by writing even more songs. In general, most completed albums range from 8 to 12 tracks, so try to write around 20 songs.If 20 seems like too many, just aim to write as many songs as you can. Having an excess of material will allow you to literally craft your album by going through a process of elimination once you’re in the final stages., As you narrow down the final tracks, think of the album as sculpture.Carve away the songs that don't fit your concept. Don’t focus on choosing what you perceive to be the obvious “singles” – include a wide range of songs.   Contrast is important to maintain a listener’s attention. Produce only the best of your music. Choose the songs that truly showcase your musical talent.  Track sequencing has always been important, but in today’s digital music market, it’s even more so. Research has shown that the earlier a track appears on a record, the more likely a consumer is to listen to it.The first song in particular is crucial, since it sets the tone for the entire piece.   If you’re working with a very particular theme or concept, try to create a narrative framework. It might help to imagine that you’re composing the music for a film.If you aren’t trying to tell a literal story, think more in terms of grouping songs together in chunks that relate to one another in a way that makes sense to you. Even if your concept/theme is more on the ambiguous side, you still want the album to be as cohesive as possible.  At this point you probably already have a working title in mind, but it’s best to wait until the entire thing is compiled before committing to one. Choose a title that conveys the theme/concept you’ve been working toward. Go through your lyrics and see if anything jumps out at you as being title material.   Bands often use the title of one of the songs as the album title. If you decide to go this route, choose the song that best exemplifies the theme or mood of your album. Another popular choice is to self-title the record, especially if it’s a debut album. To self-title means to make your band’s name the record title. Consider this if you feel that the album’s themes encapsulate what your band is fundamentally all about.  Studios usually charge by the hour and they are not cheap. Because of this, make sure that you’ve rehearsed the studio versions of your new songs until you have them down cold. Do as much pre-production on the album as you possibly can before hitting the studio.Figure out the BPM of each song before you go into the studio. This will help you avoid wasting valuable studio time figuring out tempos. If you have fellow band members, make sure everyone has rehearsed. Ask everyone to tune and prep their instruments before going into the studio.If you are self-recording your record at home, this is still a good rule of thumb. Before you sit down to record a single note, do all of the pre-production for your record.  Everyone should put away their cell phones and come into the studio ready to focus on recording the songs. Make sure the room is comfortable enough to spend large chunks of time in.Limit (or even prohibit) visits from friends, family and significant others.   Remember to take frequent breaks to avoid over-exerting yourself. You want to keep your mind sharp. Step outside for a few minutes every hour or so for a breather. Avoid using drugs and/or alcohol in the studio. Abusing substances is a very popular musician cliché, but you run the risk of wasting studio time and negatively affecting your ability to play the songs., It’s good to go into the studio with high expectations, but don’t hinder yourself by establishing goals that don’t make sense. Even the simplest of songs should take you about 1-2 hours to record, not counting set up time.Expect overdubs to take about 1 hour per song.   Book your studio hours based on the above estimations. You may want to even give yourself a little extra time on top of that. It’s better to work with a slight excess of time rather than not enough. Otherwise, you’ll stress yourself out by rushing to finish, and may end up with recordings that you aren’t proud of.  Get a list of what gear the studio has to offer before you go in and have a discussion with the engineer about what sound you are going for. The most important aspect is tracking the drums, since they are the hardest to get right in a recording. If you are short on cash, book studio time just for drum tracking. The rest can be done at a home studio with software like Pro Tools or Logic, especially if your band already owns decent gear and you have some quality microphones.To record good vocals, all you really need is a quality mic and an isolation booth. If money is an issue, vocals can definitely be recorded outside of an expensive studio. Use the talents of your friends whenever possible. As a musician, you probably know people who have engineering talents and home studios., You need to listen to the recordings with a critical ear, but try to step back and be as objective as possible. It is not uncommon for musicians to over analyze the smallest of details in the studio and then tweak their recordings until they sound completely sterile.   You want the songs to sound good, but you also want to preserve their original creativity. Overuse of studio equipment has a way of sanitizing recordings to a fault. It might help to bring some trusted friends in, after the majority of the recording is completed, to get fresh ears on the recordings.  Cover art is often the final piece of the puzzle – the visual representation of what the album sounds like. The artwork can pull together your theme and add to the cohesiveness of the songs. It’s also crucial because it’s the first interaction most potential buyers will have with the album.   Create or choose powerful images that represent your songs. Keep your album’s theme and overall mood in mind. You want the artwork to be eye-catching, but it should also epitomize your album’s theme., The colors used in the artwork are just as important as the images themselves, so develop a color theme that reflects the album’s emotions.It wouldn’t make sense to record a bleak record about the death of a loved one and then put a pink and yellow cover on it. Conversely, a jubilant-sounding album shouldn’t have artwork that is mostly black or gray.Inspect the artwork of some of your favorite albums for inspiration. Think about how the color choices on those album covers relate to the emotion of the records.  This includes even the font choices and your band’s logo (if you have one). The idea is to present a complete package – a fully realized piece of art.   The more uniform your complete album package is, the easier it is for people to remember. Keep consistency in mind even when it comes to your band’s merchandise, website, etc. For example, a somber album shouldn’t be paired with a pink band t-shirt.  When it comes to your album, you are the expert. You know it inside and out. If you aren’t artistic in this way, try to work up a loose initial design in Photoshop or on paper before handing it off to more capable hands. At the very least, have a solid idea of what you are trying to achieve with the artwork before having someone else design it.   Be protective of your vision, but also leave a little room for the artist to be creative.Make sure the final design has a high quality digital file that goes with it. When the artwork goes to print, the highest resolution possible is needed to ensure the final product looks solid and professional.	Develop a theme or concept for your album. Build on songs that you’ve already written. Spend a significant amount of time crafting new songs. Practice frequently. Book gigs and perform in front of crowds as often as possible.Performing will give you the chance to perfect your songs and test your new material out on an audience. Collaborate with your bandmates. Write more songs than you’ll need for a single record. Choose the best tracks for the record. Arrange the track listing with emphasis on the first track. Give the album a title. Rehearse the songs to prepare for recording in the studio. Remove all distractions from the studio. Create a realistic recording schedule and stick to it. Use the best studio equipment you can afford. Avoid overthinking every detail. Make sure the artwork represents what the album is about. Put some thought into the color choices. Be consistent once you’ve decided on a particular vibe and treatment.Your chosen theme and album vibe should have continuity across the board. Create your own artwork whenever possible.
Gardenias perform best in day temperatures between 65-70 degrees F (18-21 degrees C) and night temperatures between 60-65 degrees F (15-18 degrees C). Since most climates will only see these temperatures in the spring, that’s the best time to plant them to ensure flower buds form.If your climate sees colder temperatures in the spring, you may want to wait until late spring to plant. And if your climate is hotter, plant in late winter or early spring.; , Your gardenia should receive 6-8 hours of full sun a day. If you live somewhere with very hot temperatures, pick a spot with morning sun and afternoon shade so that it doesn’t get scorched.Potted gardenias should be placed somewhere with bright light but no direct sunlight. If indoors, try a table beside a bright window. For outside, place it on a bright but shaded deck or balcony., Gardenias like acidic soil, so test the soil where you’d like to plant it. You can use a store-bought probe or take a sample and pour water and baking soda on it to see if it fizzes. If not, you can make the soil more acidic by purchasing sulfur from a home improvement or garden store and adding the amount recommended on the packaging.Avoid planting your gardenia near a concrete walk or foundation, since the soil will likely be too alkaline., Gardenias have shallow roots, so you don’t need to dig it very deep, but make it 2-3 times as wide as the root ball. If you’re planting multiple gardenias, space them at least 3-6 feet (1-2 meters) apart., Add some organic matter like peat moss, which you can buy at a garden store, or compost, which you can make at home by combining dead plants, food scraps, and water in your backyard. Then place the gardenia in the hole and fill the hole halfway with some of the displaced soil., Pour enough water into the hole to saturate the soil. This will help settle the soil and reduce air pockets. Once you see the water drain away, refill the rest of the hole with the remaining soil., To maintain the moisture in the soil and keep its temperature constant, add 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) of organic mulch around the base of the plant. This may result in excess fertilizer salts in the soil, so water once a month with distilled water to drain them away., Gardenias should receive the equivalent of 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rain a week, but you can simply water your gardenia whenever the top inch of soil begins to feel dry. Check the moisture level by sticking your finger down into the soil at the base of the plant. If it feels dry, saturate the soil with water., Gardenias need humidity to thrive, so many people mist them regularly with a spray bottle of water. This can lead to fungal infection on the leaves, however, so it’s better to place the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water. You can also use a humidifier in the same room as an indoor plant to help with moisture., During the growing season, lay acid fertilizer, fish emulsion, or bone meal across the soil at the base of the plant. You generally won’t need to do this from November to February., Whenever you see your gardenia blooms begin to fade, clip them back to just below the leaf node. This will encourage continuous blooming.If you wish to prune the plant down, only do so when the plant is not actively growing (during the winter months is ideal). This will promote branching and give it a chance to heal.  These pests can sicken your plants over time so it’s important to spot them early and treat the problem. Whiteflies look like miniature white moths and mealybugs look like tiny cotton balls stuck to the leaves. Check the top and bottoms of leaves as well as the stems for any insects., If you spot any pests, purchase an insecticidal soap or horticultural oil at a garden store and spray the tops and bottoms of all leaves. Do this 3 times, waiting about a week between each application., For cold snaps that produce frost, or throughout the winter months, bring potted gardenias inside. For planted gardenias, cover them with large tarps or blankets, or place a cardboard box over it.	Plant your gardenia in the spring. Select a spot with full sun or light shade. Test your soil for a pH of 5-6. Dig a hole as deep as the root ball. Transfer the plant into nutrient-rich soil. Water the roots and fill in the soil. Add mulch around the base. Keep the soil moist. Create humidity for an indoor plant. Fertilize the gardenia every 3-4 weeks. Clip faded flowers. Look for whiteflies and mealybugs. Spray infested leaves with an insecticidal soap. Protect the plant during cold snaps.
You can rent a pressure washer from your local hardware store. Rent a pressure washer with a flow rate of at least 4 gpm (gallons per minute) and a PSI of at least 3,000., Remove dirt, leaves, twigs, and other debris from your steps using a broom or an electric blower. Also make sure to remove nearby plants, toys, furniture, and decorations.Make sure to cover any nearby plants that cannot be removed with a tarp or trash bags.  Fill a plastic bucket with one part hot water to two parts liquid dish soap. Mix the ingredients together until they are well-combined. Then scrub the treatment into the concrete using a push broom or a stiff bristle brush. Let the solution set for 15 to 20 minutes.Alternatively, you can pretreat the steps with a specially formulated concrete cleaner.  Hook the pressure washer up per the directions on the instruction manual. Use the high-pressure nozzle and rinse mode to clean the steps. With the nozzle facing the concrete, press the trigger. Starting from the top of the steps, begin to clean them in a back and forth sweeping motion.Wash the steps until all of the soap, dirt, and grime are removed. To ensure your safety, wear close-toed shoes, clothing that can get wet, and safety goggles.  Do this once the steps are completely clean. If you are going to apply a sealant, make sure the concrete is completely dry before doing so.It may take one to two days for the concrete to dry completely.	Rent a pressure washer. Clear debris away from the steps. Pre-treat the steps. Wash the steps. Let the steps air dry.
A parallel circuit has more than one loop and all are connected to same voltage. The capacitors in the circuit are arrange in parallel to each other.  , The sum of all the capacitance value in a parallel circuit equals to the total capacitance in the circuit. This is given by the equation CT=C1+C2+C3. .  For example: A parallel circuit has three capacitors of value: C1 = 2F, C2 = 3F, C3 = 6F. Then the total capacitance, CT is 2+3+6 = 11 F.  The total charge in a circuit depends on the total voltage and the total capacitance in a circuit. This relationship is given by the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}.   For example: The circuit has a total capacitance of 11 F and total voltage of 10 V. Plug in the givens to the equation: Q = 11*10 = 110 C.  In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each capacitor is the same and equal to the total voltage in the circuit.   For example: The total voltage in the circuit is 10 V. Then the voltage across V1 is 10 V, V2 is 10 V and V3 is 10 V.    , Once the voltage is identified for each capacitor with a known capacitance value, the charge in each capacitor can be found using the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}.   For example: The voltage across all the capacitors is 10V and the capacitance value are 2F, 3F and 6F respectively.  Charge in first capacitor is Q1 = C1*V1 = 2*10 = 20 C.  Charge in first capacitor is Q2 = C2*V2 = 3*10 = 30 C.  Charge in first capacitor is Q3 = C3*V3 = 6*10 = 60 C.  Once the voltage and charge in each capacitor is calculated, the circuit is solved. Label these information in the circuit drawing to keep everything organized.	Identify the circuit. Calculate the total capacitance. Calculate the total charge. Find the total voltage across each capacitor. Calculate the charge in each capacitor. Draw and label each capacitor with its charge and voltage.
You can simply crack the egg in half, but you won't have much space to plant the seeds in. Instead, consider cracking the egg near the upper third with a spoon.Save the egg yolk and white for eating later.   Don't use hardboiled eggs, as the shells would be brittle. If you already cooked the egg, save the water you cooked it in, let it cool, and use it to water your plants instead. Don't use colored or painted eggs (such as Easter eggs). The pigments in paints and markers contain dyes that can harm the delicate seedlings., When rinsing the shell, be sure to run your finger around the inside of the shell to remove any residue.  It is easiest if you do this from the inside.It is not absolutely necessary, but it will help prevent over-watering, which can kill a young plant. , Larger vegetables, such as beans, cucumber, and squash can work, but they will need to be moved outside 1 week after they sprout.Consider easy-to-grow herbs, such as: basil, dill, and parsley. Marigolds are great for starting in eggshells, and they are edible too., The holder can be as simple as an egg carton to as fancy as an egg holder. If you are using an egg carton, consider lining it with plastic first so that it doesn't get soggy from the draining water.  Depending on what type of seed you planted, you might see the seedling emerge in less than a week. When watering the seedlings, consider using a spray bottle instead of a watering can; it will be a lot more gentle on the delicate, young plants.Depending on how dry it is in your home, you may need to water the seeds every day to every few days. Consider rotating the eggshell every few days. This will allow the plants to get equal amounts of sunlight and grow more evenly.You may need to pull out the smaller/weaker seedlings so that each eggshell has one plant growing in it. This will ensure that the young seedlings enough space to grow in., Before you plant the egg in the soil, crush it slightly in your hand—enough to break the shell but not so much that the soil loses its shape. This will break the shell up a little and allow the roots to poke through.Eggshells are biodegradable. As they decompose, they will release nutrients and calcium into the soil, which will help the young plant grow.,	Crack open a raw egg and remove the yolk and white. Clean the shell, inside and out, using warm water, then set it down in the sun the dry. Consider poking a small drainage hole in the bottom of the shell using a pin or thumb tack. Fill the eggshell with damp, seed-starting soil.If you are having trouble getting the soil into the eggshell, roll up a piece of paper into a cone, and use it to funnel the soil into the shell instead.You can also use a small spoon instead.  , Sprinkle 2 to 3 seeds on top and lightly cover them with more soil.Smaller plants, such as flowers and herbs, work best when starting in eggshells. Place the egg in a holder and place it on a sunny windowsill where it won't be disturbed. Water the seeds, and wait for them to grow. Transplant the eggshell outside when the seedling has 1 to 2 sets of true leaves. Finished.
Check metal roof vents, flashing or metal valleys on the roof to see if there are any dents. Soft metal will show dents, and also indicate the size of the hail.; ,   Check the ridge cap of the roof for dents. This area of the roof will receive the most damage from hail since it is flat and will take a direct hit in a storm. Look at the shingles. Check the whole shingle, as well as the edges, for signs of damage.  The 3 major signs of hail damage include bruising, cracking and granules missing from asphalt.   Check for missing pieces in the asphalt of the roof. Look for areas on the shingle that have exposed, black substrate. This means the granules of the asphalt have been compromised or knocked off by something. Search for bruising in the shingles. Dents from hail are not always completely visible. Run your hand over the shingle to feel for small dimples in the surface. Press 1 of the dimples to see if it has any give. If it does, this is a sign that the shingle has begun some deterioration. Look for cracking in the shingle. Large hail can make a circular crack if the hail hits it hard enough.	Search for damage on the metal. Set up a ladder to your roof to examine the top of the roof. Identify the types of damage caused by hail.
Loosen the radiator cap to release any pressure still left, and then re-tighten.  Many newer cars have the cap on the coolant reservoir instead of the radiator itself, but, on certain cars, there may be no radiator cap at all. In this case, emit the pressure by loosening the thermostat cap.; , Elevating the car on ramps may help the process., The heater inlet hose usually runs between the firewall and the top of the radiator. This may be done using a clamp and a couple of screws., Attach a coupler to the flushing tee to prevent backwash.  The black part should attach to the tee and the yellow part should attach to a garden hose. On cars with no radiator cap (or reservoir cap), flush by disconnecting the upper radiator hose.  A cleaning solution may have also been provided in the antifreeze flush kit.,, Some leakage of water and diluted antifreeze will come out of the tee., Replace your radiator cap and run your car for 10 minutes after it reaches its running temperature., Add more as needed.	Check the engine to make sure it is no longer hot. Place a pan or bucket under the radiator plug beneath the car to catch the old antifreeze. Splice the "Flush Tee" to the heater inlet hose. Remove the cap covering the tee as well as the radiator cap. Flush with tap water until it runs clear.Mix antifreeze according to what your climate needs, somewhere between a 50% and 70% mix. Pour the amount you measured into your radiator, reservoir or thermostat opening. Recap the tee and tighten the clamp by hand. Allow your engine to cool again and check antifreeze levels.
A vocal range is the span from the lowest to highest note that a voice can make. There are four main vocal ranges with several sub-ranges that people can produce.   Every person possesses a different vocal range, and while men typically fill out the lower ranges and women the higher ranges, some people possess an ability to span several ranges. The four main vocal ranges from highest to lowest are: Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass. Sub ranges include: Mezzo-soprano, Contralto, Countertenor/Tenor 1 or Tenor 2, Baritone. High tenor is also known as Countertenor or Tenor 1.; , Middle C will help you find your vocal range since it’s in the middle of the piano or keyboard and a great starting pitch that most people can sing.   To locate middle C, Look for the name of the piano manufacturer in the center of the piano. You’ll see a grouping of five black keys in the middle separated by two white keys. The white key directly to the left of two black keys in the center of the piano is middle C.  You can find your vocal range on a piano, keyboard, or with a computer program by singing along as you go up and down in the notes. To accurately find your full vocal range it’s best to do some vocal warm ups before you begin to loosen up your vocal chords.   Start warming your voice up by humming, allowing your pitch to slide up and down freely. Perform lip trills by pursing your lips and blowing air through them as if you were blowing bubbles underwater. Sing scales.Start at middle C and match pitch. Then progress downward on the piano hitting each note and matching its pitch. Once you’ve gone as far down as you can and still produce a sound with your voice, make your way back up and continue matching pitch to notes until you’ve gone as high as possible being to sustain the note. As you go higher up, you will have to sing in head voice and falsetto. Head voice is when you feel the vibrations in your head as you’re producing sound from higher up in your body. Think Mickey Mouse when trying to sing in head voice. Head voice marks the break in your voice, where you can’t smoothly hit a higher note. Falsetto, or “false voice” is when you feel that nasally pinch in the back of your throat. Once you’ve gone as low and high as you can, count how many octaves your voice spans. Each octave is eight notes. Start at middle C and count down to the next C, remembering which is the lowest key you could hit. Repeat with the upper keys. Most people possess a range of 1.5 octaves. High Tenor is in the (G♯2-)C♯3-B4(-E5) range.  If you naturally sing in the tenor range, you’re well on your way to singing in high tenor. Locate middle C again and match pitch with an "Ahhhhh" sound.   Now locate the C an octave below Middle C, followed by the C an octave above Middle C. Match your voice to each note by going, "Ahhhhh." Typically the highest note for a tenor is around the E5 key.  Your head voice is like a bell. In order to master your head voice, you have to be able to access the resonance in your nasal cavity and employ your pharynx. The pharynx is the passageway that connects your nasal cavity to your larynx.Start in the middle of your range and produce an “Ng” sound. As you open your mouth into an “Ahhhh” sound and move up through the scale, really connect to the vibration you feel in the back of your neck.Head voice is a connected sound, as it still involves part of your chest. Meaning that you may not feel a break when transitioning from chest voice to head voice. To strengthen your head voice, sing an “Ahh” sound starting at the upper middle point in your range and sliding up until you can’t sing any higher without transitioning into falsetto. Do lip rolls. Lip rolls will help you learn to control your vocal cord closure, which develops a well rounded head voice.  Register breaks occur when you transition from chest voice to a higher mode like head voice or falsetto. Breaks can also occur when coming back down, and can be smoothed out with proper technique and practice.You can learn to minimize your break by opening up the throat further through manipulation of vowels. This means not pronouncing vowels as you would when speaking. Instead drawing out and rounding vowel sounds to keep your larynx stable.  Countertenors have the ability to produce a full sound in falsetto, sometimes allowing the voice to reach lower alto levels. Your falsetto doesn’t draw from your chest, but your nose and throat.If you’ve ever imitated a female voice, this is similar to falsetto. To produce a well rounded falsetto sound, keep your larynx stable, and picture yourself closing around the notes, not pushing or straining them outward. Start with the lowest note that you can in falsetto and practice scales going up and down until you can produce a consistent sound.  They tend to be tensed when hitting high notes.   You might be tempted to raise your chin as if you’re reaching for the note, but this will strain your voice and restrict your vocal cords. Keep your head level. Pull your shoulders back and align your spine in a straight line, extending through the crown of your head.  It will help you hit the higher notes and it should be very light sound. Project your voice from your nasal cavities.When you sing higher notes your vocal cords get tighter and smaller, like the strings on a guitar. Don’t think about reaching up to hit higher notes. This will cause your voice to strain. Instead, picture reaching out farther in front of you to grab the notes.  Begin by singing an “Ahh” sound in your chest voice, and move up the scale. Notice how the pharynx and back of your throat feel when singing in your chest voice.As you ascend the scale, keep your throat open and try not to let your pharynx move up in your throat. You’re still still drawing breath from your diaphragm, but you’re not involving your nasal passages as much as you would when singing in chest voice. Pinch your nose and sing. Though higher notes involve your nasal cavity, you’re not singing out of your nose. Pinch your nose and transition to head voice and falsetto. Work on being able to produce a consistent sound with your nose blocked.  The best way to sing in high tenor is to practice repeatedly. By singing songs that force you to consistently hit higher notes you can begin to train your voice and expand your range. Consult a vocal coach to help you as well. Some countertenor songs are:   Alone in The Universe from Seussical the Musical. Bring Him Home from Les Miserables. Dentist, (The) from Little Shop of Horrors. Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You from Jersey Boys.	Learn the different vocal ranges. Find Middle C. Middle C is also referred to as C4 in Scientific Pitch Notation on a music scale. Locate your vocal range. Practice your Tenor vocal range. Develop your head voice. Smooth your register break. Practice your falsetto voice. Relax your body, especially your mouth and your shoulder area. Start singing in your Head Voice. Open the back of your throat. Practice songs that have countertenor vocals.
Trigger capos work by using a spring-loaded clamp to hold their tension. This clamp is simply is squeezed to open and close the capo. Players like trigger capos because they can be quickly and easily repositioned using just one hand, making them great for live performances.         This is the recommended type of capo for beginners, as it is simple and easy to use.; , Screw capos work using an adjustable knob that can be screwed to your desired amount of pressure. The downfall about screw capos is their impracticality – it's hard to do a live show when you have to keep screwing and unscrewing your capo in place. However, these capos are sometimes preferred when recording music because of the amount of control they give the guitar player., This design combines the speed of a trigger capo with the precision of a screw capo. Shubb capos use a simple lever, which can be adjusted for tension, and can easily be flipped on or off. Though they’re more expensive than the previous capos mentioned, they are very popular amongst seasoned guitar players., The G7th performance capos have become a favorite amongst many guitar players, as they are gentle, practical, and give the player great control. These capos allow for easy tension adjustment – all you need to do is squeeze it down over the desired location, and the G7th performance capo automatically locks in place. To release the capo, all you have to do is flip a lever.Some reviews claim that this capo is actually better at preserving the tone of your guitar as well.  Set your guitar on your lap, or place it around your shoulders using your guitar strap. You should position your guitar how you would typically play it, even if you were not using a capo. Hold your capo in your fretting hand so you can easily clip it in place.  Using a capo raises the key one half-step for every fret. If you place the capo on the first fret, the new key will be one half-step higher. If you place the capo on the second fret, the new key will be two half-steps higher. This continues with every fret.         For a specific example, let's use a standard E tuning. Say you've placed a capo on the third fret. The E strings become Gs (three half steps higher in pitch than E). All the strings become three half steps higher in pitch once the capo is applied — B becomes D; G becomes Bb; D becomes F; and A becomes C. If you're reading a tab sheet, the tab will typically tell you which fret to place your capo on.(Example: Capo 4, meaning capo on the fourth fret).  There are a few kinds of capos that operate slightly differently, though they essentially do the same thing. All have two thick rubber paddings that clamp down on the strings of your guitar. The longer side of the capo that comes in contact with the strings is the front. The back of the capo is usually shorter and clamps down on the back of the guitar neck.  If you place your capo on the wrong part of your guitar, it can easily become out of tune. The capo should be placed in the fret, just behind the fret bar. Do not leave a large space between the capo and the fret bar, but don't place it directly on top of the fret bar either.          If you place the capo too far back in the fret, it may cause your guitar to go sharp., Once you place a capo on your guitar, only the strings below the capo will be in the new raised key. The section below the capo is the part of the neck closer to the body of your guitar. The section above the capo is the part of the neck closer to the head and tuning pegs of the guitar. Be sure to only play below the capo once you've placed it on your guitar.         All of the chords you play below the capo will sound like they're in a higher key. Play the chords as you normally would.  Many guitarists choose to clip their capo on the head of their guitar during a live performance so that it is easily accessible throughout their show. This allows the guitarist to easily use the capo for some songs and take it back off for others.  All voices are different, so the original keys of some songs may not be a fit for every singer. Capos come in handy when you have to find a new key of a song for a singer. Using a capo will allow you to play the song in the new key without having to learn entirely new chords., A guitar capo can do much more than simply change the key of a song, it can create an entirely different sonic experience. For example, playing in the key of A with and without a capo will have entirely different feels even though you're playing in the same key, so experiment with your capo to hear the differences. Essentially, you'll be suing different voicing to play the same chords, which produce entirely different sounds.	Use a trigger capo. Try using a screw capo if you want greater control over your capo's pressure against the strings. Buy a Shubb capo. Invest in a premium capo. Hold your guitar and capo in the proper position. Place your capo on the desired fret. Open the capo and clamp it down in the fret, slightly behind the fret bar. Place your capo properly on the neck of your guitar. Play below the capo. Use your capo in a live performance. Find the best key for a singer. Use a capo to get a different timbre.
The international driving permit (IDP) is not truly a license. Instead it is just a translation of your existing driver's license into 11 languages. You must continue to carry your regular driver's license with you at all times.The permit is recognized in 150 countries (a list of those countries can be found at thenac.com/international_driving_permit_countries.pdf). In 40 countries, you are required to possess an IDP in order to obtain a rental car.An IDP will not be issued more than 6 months before you need it. It is only valid for one year from the date of its issuance.; , You can only receive an IDP if you currently hold a valid driver's license. An IDP will not be issued if your license is suspended or revoked. In addition, there are a few requirements.   Your domestic license must be valid for at least six months after your IDP is issued. If your license will expire during the six month period, renew your license at your local DMV office. You must be 18 to get an international driving permit.  The U.S. State Department website notes that only the National Automobile Club and the AAA offer international driver's permits in the United States.Do not pay any other organization for an international driver's permit. Such offers are often scams. Even if you do receive something that appears to be a permit, it may not be a legal document.   The United Nations does not issue international driving licenses. If you obtained a document purported to be an international driving permit issued by the U.N., you do not have a valid international driving permit. A real, valid IDP is a multi-page booklet 4 by 6 inches (10.16 by 15.24 cm) in size. It has a gray cover. It includes a page displaying the holder's name, date and place of birth and home address. This information is repeated in 9 other languages on separate pages. If you have any questions regarding the validity of an IDP, take it to your nearest AAA office.  As noted above, there are only two agencies that provide the IDP in the United States--the National Automobile Club and the American Automobile Association. You can either obtain an IDP in person or through the mail.   If you would prefer to get your IDP from AAA, you have two options. You can download the application from the American Automobile Association and bring the completed form to an AAA office near you.Alternatively, you can mail the form to the closest AAA office. You can find the AAA office in your area on their website.You can also download the application from the National Automobile Club website and mail the form to the NAC at the following address:The National Automobile Club, Attn: IDP, 373 Vintage Park Drive, Suite E, Foster City, CA 94404. Included with your application forms, you must supply two “passport type” photos. You can get these pictures taken for a small fee at an AAA office. The cost of the permit is $15 (from either association).  Even though an IDP will not be issued more than six months before you plan to travel internationally, make sure that you get your IDP well before the trip. If you have waited until the last minute, go get your IDP in person to avoid mail delays.   There is no waiting period, so if you decide to go in person everything can be handled in a single visit. Applications sent through the mail will normally be processed in 10 to 15 business days.  Remember that the IDP is really just a certified translation of your driver's license. You must keep your actual driver's license with you at all times.	Understand what an international driving permit is. Determine if you are eligible for an IDP. Watch out for scams. Apply for an international driving permit. Submit your IDP application well in advance of any travel plans. Use your IDP in the country you are visiting.
; ,   Prune your ficus tree after new growth stops for the best results. Most ficus trees put out new growth in spring and early summer. Late summer and early fall are good times to prune. Prune right before bringing a ficus back indoors if it was summered outside. Pruning can be done anytime if it’s necessary to make the plant fit into a certain area. Prune off dead or broken branches at any time.    Decide whether you need to limit the height or the width or both.       Look at the form of the tree and try to prune so that the tree has a natural looking form.  This is where a leaf or a twig joins the stem.    Cut as close to the node as you can without cutting into it. Always leave at least 1 node on a branch if you want new growth in that area. If you want to eliminate a branch so that no new growth occurs there, cut it back to just before the trunk or main limb and don’t leave a node.	Get some bypass garden pruning shears to prune a ficus. Choose the right time to prune. Examine the tree to see where it needs to be controlled. Look along the branches in the area you want to prune until you find a node. Cut the branch on a slight downward slant just before a node.
Open all of your car doors one-by-one, and take your mats out of the car, if they are removable. Do not clean them while they are still inside the car.You want to remove the mats so that you won't get water damage in your car’s interior. Also, you should not allow oily or foam consistency products to come in contact with the gas, clutch and brake pedals in your car as this could cause your foot to slip off the pedal during driving, which is dangerous. Clean the mats outside. You can clean the mats at a gas station or at home in your parking lot or inside your garage. Most car mats are removable. However, occasionally the mats are built into the car. In those cases, you will have to clean them inside the car.; , Use a vacuum to ensure that you suction up all of the dust particles and soil specks from your car mats before you try to clean them further.   Cleaning a damp carpet mat can be difficult. You could use baking soda to absorb some moisture and foul odor by lightly sprinkling it onto the carpet floor mat and then leaving it to sit for about 10-20 minutes, before vacuuming. Vacuum the mats on both sides, making sure to thoroughly get crumbs and dust off of them. , This will shake out some of the dust that is embedded in the rubber or cloth floor mats. Do this outside.   Give the mat a couple of whacks against the ground. Find a hard surface to strike the mats against. This works for rubber and cloth mats. You might also want to use a scraper to remove hardened materials from the rubber mat before cleaning it.	Remove your floor mats, whether rubber or cloth, from your car, if possible. Vacuum cloth floor mats first. Shake or whack the mats to remove dirt.
As night slowly begins to fall over a city's streets and highways, there is almost always an hour or two during which some cars will have their headlights on and others will not. As a general rule, if you notice the day becoming darker (even just slightly), it's a smart idea to flip your headlights on. Though you may not need your headlights to see the road during these times, other drivers may have an easier time seeing you with your headlights on (especially if the setting sun is behind you, obscuring the view of oncoming traffic).Additionally, it's important to note that in many jurisdictions, driving without your headlights on in the evening or morning can be against the law. For instance, in California, headlights must be on from one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after sunrise (and during any other low-visibility conditions).; , As a general rule, night driving requires slower speeds than daytime driving. Because visibility is much lower at nighttime than during the day (even on well-lit urban roads), it takes longer to see and react to traffic hazards, pedestrians, and other obstacles. Since you can't control the types of hazards you'll encounter on your drive but you can control your driving, your smartest move is simply to drive slower, giving yourself more time to react to any problems you come across. You'll never want to "out-drive" your headlights — that is, to drive so fast that you can't stop within the distance illuminated by your headlights in front of you.   A good rule of thumb for night driving is: "The posted speed limit is the highest speed that's legal — not the highest speed that's safe." Don't be afraid to go slower than the posted speed limit if you can't see very far in front of you, especially if you're rounding a corner or going over a hilltop, where your visibility is further obscured. Allow other drivers to pass you as needed.  Statistically, there are almost always more drunk and overtired drivers on the road at night than there are during the day.This can have deadly consequences — for instance, in 2011, drunk driving contributed to more than four times as many accidents at night as it did during the day.Both of these conditions can dramatically lower a driver's reaction speed and lead to reckless behavior, so keep an eye out for erratic drivers on the road and give them a wide berth.   Keep in mind that weekend nights (Friday and Saturday) usually have more drunk drivers than ordinary weeknights because many people choose to start their weekend with a drink or two. Holidays can be especially bad. For instance, some analysis has shown that the early hours of January 1st can be the deadliest time of the year for drunk driving accidents., Just as you'll want to keep an eye out for other motorists who may be impaired by fatigue, you'll also want to make sure to keep your own fatigue in check. Being fatigued on the road can have many of the same risks as being drunk, including decreased awareness, slower reaction times, frequent "spacing out," weaving in and out of the lane, and so on.To fight these problems, be sure to stop frequently, giving yourself a chance to exercise, have some food and/or caffeine, and re-focus before getting back on the road.   If you're too tired to drive safely — for instance, if you're having trouble keeping your eyes open — pull over or find a rest stop and get some sleep. It's much better to be safe than sorry and the life-threatening risks of falling asleep at the wheel for just a few seconds are much more important than the inconvenience of being late to your destination.  Animals crossing the road can be especially dangerous at night. It can be very difficult to see animals ahead of you on poorly-lit roads when driving at high speeds and crashes involving large animals like deer can be deadly or cause major damage (for the driver, animal, and car). Stay vigilant when you're in places where deer or other animals are likely to cross the road (like rural areas). Pay attention to any animal crossing signs posted near the road and lower your speed appropriately. Additionally, be aware that most deer-related accidents occur in the late fall and early winter (though they can happen year-round).If you see an animal ahead of you, the smartest move is usually not to swerve. While it may be your first instinct, swerving is actually the leading cause of injuries and fatalities from deer-related accidents.Instead, lower your speed as much as you can by pressing the brakes and allow your car to hit the animal. One useful trick for spotting animals ahead of you is to look for their retinas. While it's usually difficult or impossible to see an animal's body before it comes into the range of your headlights, you can often see the light reflected in its eyes from much farther away.If you see two closely-spaced glowing dots in the darkness up ahead, slow down!  , "Spacing out" can be a big problem for nighttime drivers. To stay focused, try to keep your eyes moving while you drive. Constantly scan the road ahead of you for potential hazards. Glance to the sides of the road and check your mirrors occasionally to remain aware of your surroundings. Resist the urge to simply focus on the dividing line in the middle of the road — this doesn't give you much important visual information and can "hypnotize" you into a state of reduced awareness.The relatively quiet, calm atmosphere of most night driving and the uniformity of dark or pitch-black surroundings can combine to put night drivers into a dangerous trance-like state. Even if a driver doesn't outright fall asleep, this distracted state, which can cause lower reaction times, forgetfulness, and other dangerous problems, can be very unsafe. Always stay alert and vigilant — your life and the lives of other motorists may depend on it.  It may seem obvious, but it definitely bears mentioning that all of the safety precautions you take during the day are especially important at night. Make sure to buckle up, adjust your seat and mirrors, put away your cell phone, and focus on driving while you're behind the wheel. These simple, everyday precautions make driving safer and accidents less likely, day or night.  Your headlights are your most important lifeline when driving at night. If they're not in good working condition, you're essentially increasing your risk of an accident for nothing. Keep your headlights clean by washing them every few weeks — this should keep their brightness and clarity high. If a headlight burns out, replace it as soon as you can during the day and avoid driving at night until you can do so. Note that it is often illegal to drive without proper working headlights.   In addition, for top visibility, you'll want to keep your windshield, windows, and mirror as clear and clean as you can. Avoid using your hand to wipe these important parts of your car — the natural oils of your skin can leave obscuring smudges. Instead, use a newspaper or microfiber towel.  Your car's high-beam lights can seriously boost your safety while driving at night, but only if you use them correctly. High-beams should be used when driving in very dark, low-visibility areas where there is not much traffic. In these cases, high-beams can make your field of vision much wider and deeper, so use them as needed.   Be sure to turn off your high-beams when following another car or there is oncoming traffic. In these cases, the bright light of the high-beams can distract other drivers, making it harder for them to drive safely. If you're rounding a corner or going over a hilltop and you start to see the faint glow of another car's headlights from around the bend, turn your high-beams off in advance so that the other driver isn't suddenly blinded.  Sometimes, a car's headlights are angled lower to the ground than is necessary or aren't aligned perfectly symmetrically. The brightest headlights in the world aren't useful if they're not properly angled to illuminate as much of the road in front of you as possible, so if you're having a hard time seeing ahead while driving at night, you may want to consider having your headlights re-adjusted. At a professional mechanic's shop, this procedure is usually quite quick and cheap.   It's also possible to adjust your headlights yourself. Since every car is different, if you want to do this, be sure to follow the instructions in your car's owner's manual. Be patient — it can take some time to get a set of headlights aligned perfectly., In a perfect world, other drivers would always dim their high-beams when they see you, just as you would for them. Unfortunately, drivers don't always remember to do this. If an oncoming car has its high-beams on, avoid looking at them, as their bright light can momentarily blind you. Instead, glance to the right hand side of your lane (or, in countries that drive on the left side of the road, the left) while keeping your peripheral vision alert to hazards. This keeps you as alert of the hazards around you as possible while preserving your vision.   If a car behind you is using its high-beams, try adjusting your rear view mirror to keep the light out of your eyes. You can even move the mirror to shine the light back at the driver and alert him to his mistake., If you anticipate doing lots of driving at night and in foggy conditions, you may want to consider investing in a set of after-market fog lights. Often, these lights are mounted low on the front bumper to illuminate as much of the road ahead as possible (fog often is thinnest in the foot or so just above the road).However, not all after-market lights are created equal, so talk to an automotive expert before making this purchase.   Never use your car's default high-beams in the fog. The reflective water particles that make up fog can shine the bright light back at you, obscuring your vision of the road more than if you had used no lights at all.  Other cars' headlights (and especially high-beams) can pose unique challenges to drivers with glasses. Glasses can sometimes reflect oncoming lights in ways that create an obscuring glare for the wearer. To avoid this, try wearing contacts or buying a set of glasses that use an anti-reflective coating, which should minimize these effects.If you do buy a specialty pair of glasses, keep them in your car so that they'll be available to you whenever you go driving.  Once you've mastered the fundamentals of safe night driving, the experience can actually be a fun, relaxing one, especially if you make the most of entertaining opportunities that also help you drive safely. For instance, if you have a passenger in the car with you while you're driving at night, you may want to partially engage yourself in a light conversation with him or her. Talking to other people is a great way to stave off driving fatigue, and the calm, pitch-black surroundings can often encourage surprisingly intimate conversations.   Be sure, however, not to engage yourself too heavily in the conversation. Getting into a heated argument, for example, can distract you from the most important task at hand — driving safely.  Driving at night can be a fantastic time to listen to your favorite music on your car's stereo. The relative quiet and calm of night driving makes it easier to hear a song's minor details, making good music especially enjoyable. Some people prefer to listen to slick disco or electronica cuts at night, while others appreciate the thrill of hard rock tracks. There's no "right" type of music to listen to at night — it's up to you! Below are just a few great night driving tracks from several different genres (there are many, many more):   Kavinsky - "Nightcall" Chromatics - "Back From the Grave" DJ Shadow - "Midnight in a Perfect World" Kyuss - "Gardenia" Allan Kingdom - "Evergreens" Golden Earring - "Radar love" Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich - "Hold Tight" Quiet Riot - "Party All Night" Daft Punk - "Contact" Charles Mingus - "Moanin'"  , Driving at night can sometimes be a way to come into contact with people and things that you wouldn't otherwise see! For instance, most major city centers truly "come to life" at night and bustle with unique characters enjoying the night life. Even rural areas can have their share of unique late-night "flavor". Every stretch of road is different, so keep your eyes peeled for attractions as you drive — if you're taking lots of breaks to fight night-driving fatigue, you should have ample opportunities to stop. Below are just a few things you may want to look out for:   Late-night diners/hang-outs Bars and nightclubs (note: avoid drinking and driving, especially at night) Truck stops/rest areas Scenic paths and overlooks Camp grounds Drive-in attractions (theaters, restaurants, etc.)  , Driving at night can be an experience like no other. With the calm, steady hum of the engine and the darkness of your surroundings, driving can be almost like flying through space. Driving at night feels mysterious, fun, and even exciting — for some people, it's one of life's simplest yet most addictive joys. It's perfectly fine to enjoy a good night drive, but don't forget to focus on what's most important of all — your safety and the safety of other drivers. Always remember that getting distracted while driving can be deadly (especially at night), so keep your attention on the road. If you're confident in your safe driving habits, you'll be able to responsibly relax, tune in, and enjoy your ride!	When in doubt, turn your lights on. Slow down. Be wary of drunk and tired drivers. Take frequent breaks to fight fatigue. Watch for animals, especially in rural areas. Keep your eyes moving. Take all normal daytime driving precautions. Keep your headlights, mirrors, and windshield in top condition. Use your high-beams for low-light situations. Consider adjusting your headlights. Deal with others' high-beams by glancing to the side of the road. Consider adding low-to-the-ground fog lights. If you wear glasses, use an anti-reflective coating. Stay awake by talking to a passenger. Listen to night-driving tunes. Visit late-night attractions. Enjoy the calm (responsibly).
Burning is a good way to remove the stump after you have killed it. Start by drilling plenty of holes across the surface of the stump. The holes should be about 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide and at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep, or 12 inches (30.5 cm) if you have a long enough drill bit. Penetrating deeply will ensure the stump gets burned down to the tips of the roots so that it will be easy to remove.  Soaking the stump with kerosene will enable you to light it on fire so it will burn into ash. Make sure the stump is fully saturated, or the fire may go out before it reaches the tips of the roots.          Another option is to place charcoal on top of the stump and light the charcoal on fire. The coals will slowly burn down through the stump. This method will reduce the chances of burning nearby plants. If you're worried about nearby objects catching fire, you shouldn't use this method. You're going to be setting the stump on fire, and while it's quite effective, it can be dangerous if you don't have plenty of room around the stump. Check local city ordinances to make sure it’s legal to do a controlled burn. Call 411 to find out more information.  Put scrap wood on top of the stump and use a fire starter to ignite it. As the fire burns down, the stump will catch and burn up. Look closely to make sure the stump actually catches, and add more wood as necessary to keep the fire going.         Be sure to monitor the stump as it burns to ash. Don’t leave it unattended, in case the fire gets out of hand. Depending on the size of the stump, the burn may take several hours.  Use a shovel to remove all of the ashes, down through where the roots were, and fill in the hole with fresh soil.	Drill holes in the stump. Pour kerosene into the holes. Build a fire on top of the stump. Dig out the ashes and fill in the hole.
There are a number of products designed specifically to clean your tires. Spray tire cleaner onto your tires and follow the directions regarding how long to leave it on.Car wash soap is designed to clean and protect paint and clear coat, not rubber, so it can leave a film over your tires or prevent them from shining. Just as car wash soap does a poor job of cleaning tires, tire cleaner can have a negative effect on the paint of your vehicle. Do your best to avoid getting any on the paint. There are some cleaners designed for use on both wheels and tires. If you did not purchase cleaner designed for both applications, avoid getting tire cleaner on your wheels.; , Because rubber is a fairly porous surface, it can be difficult to get the grime and brake dust off of your tires. Allow the tire cleaner to sit on the tire for a minute or two, so it can soak in and dislodge as much dirt and grime as possible.Follow the instructions regarding how long to let the tire cleaner sit on the tire for optimal effect. Wipe any overspray on the wheels or paint off immediately with a clean rag.  If your tires have a white film or have browned due to deposits of grime, you may need to scrub them to get them clean. Use a brush with fairly stiff bristles and don’t be afraid to apply a lot of pressure when scrubbing your tires clean for the best results.It does not matter if you scrub your tires in a back and forth or circular motion as long as you are consistent throughout the tire. Use a stiffer brush than you would on paint, but avoid steel tooth brushes as they may penetrate the rubber and lead to leaks.  After scrubbing as much grime off of the tire as you can, use a hose to rinse the tire off. Use a power washer or high pressure hose if possible to limit the amount of dirt that remains on the tire.Tire cleaners are designed to be environmentally safe, so it’s fine to allow the tire cleaner and water to drain or run off into your yard. Be sure to wear eye protection if using a pressure washer.  After scrubbing the tire with tire cleaner on it and rinsing it off, there may still be a white or brown film left on the tire. Reapply tire cleaner and allow it to set again, then scrub and rinse the tires a second time to remove as much road grime as possible.Read the instructions on the tire cleaner you purchased. Some may specify that they should be applied to dry rubber. If that is the case, wait for the tire to dry before reapplying. Repeat the cleaning and scrubbing process as needed for your desired level of clean.  If your tires are still brown after a thorough cleaning, you may choose to use a tire gel to return the rubber to its original shade of black. There are a number of types of tire gel, but most are applied with a sponge to the entire sidewall of the tire. Apply the gel and then rinse it off one tire at a time to avoid letting it dry out on the tire.Tire gels can undo rubber browning from age. It is best to apply tire gel to an already cleaned tire.	Use a cleaner designed for tires. Allow the cleaner to sit for a minute. Use a stiff brush to clean tires. Rinse the tires with a hose. Repeat the cleaner process if necessary. Use tire gel for browned tires.

Greens with dark leaves (such as spinach) and many root vegetables (such as carrots and beets) tend to work well as food dyes because they have deep, consistent, opaque coloring. Your natural food dyes will be most effective if you choose veggies that are mostly one color throughout (and which have a color that is bright or deep).Some vegetables may seem like good candidates for natural food dye, but if they have high water content (as does celery) they will actually produce very weak, light shades. Many vegetables (even those with vibrant coloring) lack the thick, concentrated juices produced by many fruits. In general, do not expect vegetable-based food dyes to be as bright or even as those made from berries. Beets (for red) and carrots (for orange) are exceptions to this rule.; , Some vegetables leach color into the water when boiled. The vegetables that work best for this are those with lots of water content (and therefore juices) that are also deeply hued. Red cabbage (for purple) and beets (for red or pink) are two great examples of vegetables that can be boiled to extract their coloring.For a more concentrated color, only use as much water as is needed to barely cover the vegetables. The colored water becomes the dye -- the more you dilute it, the lighter the shade. A good rule of thumb for figuring out which vegetables produce the best colors is that those that stain your fingers when handling them will also easily dye the foods with which they come into contact.  Use a food dehydrator or set your oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit and place the item(s) inside on an oven-safe tray. Cook them until they are as dry as possible (without becoming burned); this could take up to six hours.For large vegetables (especially sphere shaped ones), cut them into extremely thin slices before dehydrating them. This will speed up the process and dry them more consistently. Once dried, your vegetables can be safely stored in an airtight container for several months to a year.  Use a coffee grinder or food processor to do this most efficiently. The finer the powder, the less the dye will affect the texture of the food you wish to color.You can also use a mortar and pestle to grind the veggies by hand, but this will take much longer and could result in less even consistency. Thoroughly rinse off any utensils you use to make the powder before using them to grind up a different color of dried food. This will keep you from contaminating the color and flavor (if any) of your next veggie powder.  Many vegetables/herbs can be purchased in dried, powdered form, which eliminates the need to do the drying and grinding yourself. Just be sure to select those without added spices or flavoring so you don't influence the flavor of the food you wish to color.   If you are not worried about watering down your food, you can mix the powder into a small amount of water or other liquid and then stir this into the food. Do this gradually to achieve the right color and avoid over-saturating your food. For yellow dye, use stale turmeric. Turmeric is often used to give vegan puddings and tofu scrambles their "eggy," yolk-like shade. Stale turmeric tends to have lost quite a bit of its natural flavor, so use this to avoid influencing the taste of your colored food.	Choose vegetables with consistent coloring. Boil your vegetables. Dehydrate your vegetables or herbs. Grind the dried veggies into a powder. Select foods that are already in powder form.
Different drums are available for beginner players and for more advanced drummers.   A beginner bongo is smaller and does not weigh as much as drums made for more skilled players. A bongo for an advanced drummer is typically more expensive due to better quality heads and rims and more ornate design.; , The difference between the 2 materials is the tone of the sound of the drum. When it is played, a fiberglass drum offers a bright pop, while a wooden drum sends out an earthly, hollow sound.    When deciding on a rawhide skin to purchase, hold it up to the light. Look for an evenly colored skin, which indicates a skin of uniform thickness. Color variations can suggest the skin is not the same thickness all the way across, which affects the sound quality of the particular skin. Since weather affects rawhide heads, expect changes in tone as the weather changes, and plan on spending more time tuning the head. Warmer weather tightens the head and produces a higher pitch. Synthetic heads are mass produced of man-made materials and provide a consistent and smooth playing surface. Changes in weather do not affect synthetic heads. Synthetic heads offer a convenience above rawhide heads in that they come already stretched and tucked onto a frame and are ready to mount to the drum and play.    Synthetic heads are typically pre-fitted. Pre-fitted heads are convenient to replace quickly. They are not affected by humidity, altering the tuning and sound of the head, as rawhide heads are. Flat heads give you the decision power of the exact rawhide you want for your drum and the satisfaction of tucking it on your own. If you use flat heads, you will have to learn how to tuck heads, and then each time you tuck one, you will have to wait to play the bongo until the head dries.    The size of the drummer can direct you to the size of bongo you purchase. A smaller drum set better accommodating a person of smaller stature. Sound preference can be instrumental in determining the size of your bongos. Smaller drums offer a higher pitched sound, while the sound of drums with larger heads is deeper.	Purchase a bongo based on your skill level. Choose between a wood drum or a fiberglass drum. Select whether you would like synthetic or rawhide heads. Select the style of head you want: flat or pre-fitted. Pick the size of bongo that suits you.
Look for signs of an approaching train. You should see signs, like a sign with an X and RR written on it. Check for flashing lights, a person signaling a train, and a horn or bell from an approaching train. Even if there are no signs of a train, slow your bike. Crossing tracks at full speed on a bike can be dangerous.Make sure you are in the appropriate spot for a bike. The laws may state that bikers stay on the road, or on a specific bike path.  If there is a train, you should stop your bike completely and wait. Do not try to race across the track before the train approaches. Either continue sitting on your bike, or get off your bike and stand next to it while holding the handle bars. Wait until the train has passed. Make sure another train is not coming. You are able to cross the tracks when the lights have stopped flashing, and the crossing gate has been lifted., There are several risks you are taking when crossing railroad tracks on a bike. Knowing the risks before crossing the tracks will help prevent you from falling or becoming stuck on the tracks. The risks include falling into the gap next to the rail, falling in a gap near the tracks, and sliding on the tracks. The way you cross the tracks depends on what risks your perceive before crossing., Falling into the gap perpendicular to the rail happens because sometimes railroad crossings use coverings to make the railway smoother, but the coverings are made up of individual pieces that leave gaps. The gaps are often wider than a bike tire, which risks the bike tire falling into the gap. To avoid this, cross the tracks close to a 45 degree angle, instead of perpendicularly.   Judge what is a 45 degree angle by using the outermost tracks as your basis for the bottom line of the angle.  Sliding happens on the tracks when they are slippery and/or wet. Avoid leaning the bike on slippery tracks. Instead, cross the tracks in a straight line. Try to go as slowly as possible when crossing.  Do not try to line your bike up with the tracks. If your bike tires are narrow, do a slight S weave on the tracks, between 20 and 70 degrees. It is also an option to get off of your bike and walk it across the tracks.You can “hop” across the raised tracks on your bike if you are an experienced bike rider. Do not attempt this if you do not know how to jump with a bike. It is dangerous and could lead to a crash if you are not experienced.	Slow your bike when approaching railroad tracks. Wait for the train to cross. Know the risks of crossing the tracks on a bike. Go over the tracks at a 45 degree angle. Cross the tracks in a straight line. Cross the tracks safely.
For variety, choose two different colors of paper, or even pick several different colors. Pick colors that are appropriate to the season or occasion -- red, green, and yellow for Christmas, or pastel colors for a baby shower or bridal shower.; , Use a sturdy pair of scissors to cut equally-sized strips of paper from each piece of paper. You can adjust the size a bit according to your preference -- adjusting the width of the strips will make the garland loops wider and adjusting the length will make the loops longer.  Simply create a loop by making the flat strip round, and touching the edges of the paper so that they are overlapping by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). The most dependable way to make the strip stay in loop form is to glue the ends of the strip together and wait for the glue to dry before you move on. But if you don't have the time or patience to individually glue each garland, you can also tape the loops together using clear masking tape.          If you're really pressed for time, you can even staple the ends of the loops together twice. Remember that if one loop falls apart, the garland will disconnect.  Now take another strip of paper and run it through the first loop until you connect the ends of that strip to form a second loop. Connect the ends of the second loop just as you did with the first loop. If you're going for alternating colors, make sure you pick a different color for the second loop.  Continue running each strip of paper through the previous loop and then connecting it to make a loop until you've connected all of your loops and have created a paper garland of interlocking loops. If you'd like your garland to be a bit longer, just cut more strips of paper and create more loops until you're satisfied with the length.  Once your garland has been created, all you have to do is hang it up. You can drape the garland over a tree, a back patio, a column, or any piece of furniture. If you want to hang your garland up on the wall, hang the loops over a sturdy protruding nail.	Gather at least 10 pieces of construction paper. Cut at least 3 strips of 2.5 inch by 10 inch (6.3 cm by 25.4 cm) paper from each piece of paper. Form one strip of paper into a loop. Connect another loop with the first loop. Repeat this step until you've connected all of the loops. Hang up your garland.
If the non-rubber blade and arm parts are still in good condition, it goes without saying you won’t need to replace them. But sometimes the rubber breaks down faster than non-rubber parts (especially in sunny areas).Remove and replace the rubber blade inserts., Pull the metal arm away from the windshield. Where the blade attaches to the arm, you should see a joint. On this you’ll find a release for the arm. Open the release, take out the old blade, insert a new one, and reset the release.On some cars, there may be a push-tab or tension hook attaching the blades to the arm assembly. Release these kinds of fasteners with your hands and slide off the blade. Depending on who you ask, you might hear that you should change your blades every six months or once a year, but it’s always a good idea to before the rainy season., Follow the wiper blade down the arm to its base. You should see a nut sticking up from this point. Remove the nut with a wrench. Now you can pull the arm off. Fit a replacement arm into place and fasten the nut and your new assembly is good to go.With time and use, the assemblies holding your wiper blades in place can become misshapen or inflexible, contributing to squeaking.	Install new rubber inserts. Replace your wiper blades regularly. Replace the wiper assembly.
You may remove the cabinet doors entirely if the hinges are visible or if they are easily removable. This will allow you to paint the cabinet face and shelving thoroughly and separately with little mess.; ,, Apply the chemical carefully per the manufacturer's instructions. Once clean, rinse all surfaces thoroughly with fresh water and allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.  You will want to create a rough enough surface for the paint to stick to, so ensure that all surface areas are well scuffed. Once you are finished sanding, clean all of the dust away by first vacuuming the surfaces and then wiping them with a clean, damp cloth. Again, allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.  You can purchase an appropriate primer at most hardware stores. Allow the primer to dry completely per the label instructions.  Oil-based paints provide a smoother finish and are easier to clean, so they are the better choice for kitchens and bathrooms. Apply paint with a roller to avoid leaving brush strokes on the laminate surface.	Remove all visible hardware from the cabinets, including knobs and pulls.Cover any un-removable hardware with painter's tape  , Clean all laminate surfaces thoroughly with a de-greaser, such as tri-sodium phosphate. Sand all laminate surfaces with 120-grit sandpaper. Apply a specifically formulated laminate primer per the manufacturer's instructions. Apply a latex or oil-based paint of your choosing over the cured primer. Replace all hardware and rehang the cabinet doors once the paint has fully dried.
Be sure to choose your size and material wisely.   Avoid choosing a fabric that is to sheer or flimsy, unless you intend to make a sturdier lining. Avoid using a piece of fabric that is too big, but you can always cut it to size. Avoid using a piece of fabric that is too small.; ,, If your fabric has a "right side" and a "wrong side," make sure that the right sides will end up on the outside of the pouch.  If you want to, you can include a clasp or closure. At this step, you could also decorate and personalize your pouch.	Get a piece of fabric. Fold the fabric in half.  , Use a hot glue gun or sew the fabric together. Add a handle if you wish. Fill your pouch with anything you may please.
For much of the film, Burton’s Alice wears a blue dress that falls close to ankle-length. In some scenes her blue dress is loosely draped and worn off the shoulder. However, in the court scene she wears a strapless red tea-length dress with white and black sheer overlay.   Adults may own a suitable red cocktail dress. The loosely draped version of the blue dress would be difficult to buy or construct, but could be appropriate as an informal toga-style costume. Vintage stores and thrift shops can be good places to find affordable longer dresses that can be modified to look like Alice's film costume.  In the film, Alice does not wear the iconic white pinafore. However, the overlay on the red dress is something like an apron worn backwards; open at the front, covering the back.   You can make your own reverse pinafore by tying a length of black and white fabric across the back of a red dress, and draping part over one shoulder.  In the film, Alice wears white-tinted stockings but they are sheer and not terribly distinctive. In warm weather, going without stockings would likely be as appropriate as wearing nylons.  Burton’s Alice wears white lace-up boots with a kitten heel and a black toe. These might be quite difficult to find.   Black and white saddle shoes might provide a convincing alternative. Some websites that feature vintage imitation clothing, such as Modcloth, stock high heels in black and white that look similar. Purchasing a pair of white boots from a thrift store and painting them with black accents is an affordable alternative.  Alice’s hair is blonde and parted down the center. It falls in loose waves around her shoulders without a headband or other styling.   If your hair is naturally straight, use a curling iron or hot rollers to achieve more body. If your hair is naturally a color or texture that makes imitating the film look impossible, consider wearing a wig to achieve the full effect.	Pick a dress. Decide whether to use a pinafore. Choose your stockings. Find the best footwear. Style your hair.
For example, some cars have hand controls but no wheelchair access for passengers.   Decide if the disabled person will be driving or requiring a surrogate driver. If you need a rental car without wheelchair access or a swivel seat and there is a surrogate driver, the rental car company is likely to rent you a regular car and waive any driver fees by special arrangement. Determine if you need wheelchair access. People with wheelchairs may need a transfer board and an easy access bus. Vans and mini-buses are generally the only vehicles that come with wheelchair access, and there is very limited availability at major rental car companies. If the handicapped person is trained in driving with hand controls, rental car companies usually carry a limited number of vehicles that use left or right hand controls. You should also ask about a panoramic mirror for easier views and a spinner knob that helps the driver to control the wheel with a single knob. Determine if any handicapped drivers or passengers need a swivel seat to get in and out of the vehicle. These are often removable and available by request.; , Most airport websites have a list of the car rental companies that are available to its patrons.  You will need to call the company directly, instead of using travel aggregate sites like Expedia, Travelocity or Hotwire.   In busy airports and during vacation or high-season travel times you should call 1 to 3 months in advance to reserve your handicapped rental car or van.    You do not need to explain all the details of the person's disability, merely what you will need in order to rent from the company.  Most rental car agencies will require you to bring the driver's license as proof of age and the ability to drive.   A disabled person who is over the age of 25 can rent a car with a surrogate driver without a driver's license. The surrogate driver will need to be over the age of 25 with a valid driver's license. Ask if your car or van may has a handicapped accessible license plate. If not, you may need to bring your dashboard disability sticker. , Before you book, it is important to ensure they will be able to transport you to and from the rental car location in a handicapped accessible shuttle or van.  If not, you can call a wheelchair accessible van rental agency.   Accessible Vans of America, Wheelchair Getaways, Wheelchair Vans and Wheelers rent handicapped accessible vans exclusively from their websites. Specify your location and travel dates to see what availability they have.  You should be clear about what services will be provided, such as a shuttle, before you place the reservations.  Few rental car companies will charge you in advance; however, they will require a credit card in case of a late cancellation.	Determine what type of car is necessary for the needs of the handicapped person who will be using the car. Look up the airport or location where you will be arriving. Call rental car companies, like Avis, Hertz and Enterprise at least 48 hours before you arrive. Tell the customer service agent what equipment you will require in your rental vehicle. Ask what proof of disability is required upon check in. Call additional rental car agencies in the area if you are unable to find a van or car for the dates you are traveling.  , Ask what services the rental car agency will provide for pick up and drop off at an airport. Decide if a rental car company will provide what you need in a wheelchair accessible vehicle. Call to speak to a customer service representative if you have any questions. Reserve your wheelchair accessible van or car with a credit card.
It's very important for a budding autobiographer to document their life regularly. Journals, videos, photographs, and mementos of the past will be extremely helpful for you as you start walking down memory lane. We often remember things incorrectly, or struggle to remember specifics, but objects can't lie. Photos will tell you the truth. Your journal will always be honest.   If you don't already, start keeping a detailed journal of your day-to-day life. The best way to give yourself a reliable record of what was going on in your world and in your head is to keep a journal every night before you go to bed. Take lots of pictures. Imagine what it would be like to have forgotten what your best friend from school looked like, and not have a picture of them. Pictures will help jog memories later and provide a helpful record of places and events. They're essential for autobiographers. Video can be especially moving to look back on. Seeing the way in which you've aged on camera, from youth to adulthood, or seeing an old family pet living and moving around can be a powerful experience. Take lots of video over the course of your life.; , To start collecting notes and start working on an autobiography or memoir, it can be instructive to talk with other people. You may feel like you've got a good sense of yourself and your "story," but other people may have a very different version of you than you think. Ask them for their sincere impressions by conducting one-on-one interviews and recording them, or even writing up a survey and letting others fill it out anonymously. Ask specific questions of your friends, family, and acquaintances:   What is your strongest memory of me that i cannot forget? What is the most significant event, achievement, or moment of my life? What's a time you remember me being difficult? Have I been a good friend? Lover? Person? What object or place do you most associate with me? What would you want to say at my funeral?  , One excellent way of looking for meaning in a life and finding a motivation to start writing can be found in the past. Get in touch with distant relatives you might not have previously related with, and visit locations in your past that you might not have visited in a long time, if at all. See what's become of your childhood home. Go find the old park where you used to play, the church where you were baptized, the place your great-great-great-grandfather is buried. See it all.If you're the child of immigrants, it can be very moving for many people to visit the birthplace of your family, if you haven't already. Arrange a trip to the homeland of your ancestors and see if you identify with the place in a way you hadn't before. Try to get a sense not only of the story of your life, but the story of your family's life. Where did they come from? Who were they? Are you the child of cattle ranchers and steel workers, or the child of bankers and lawyers? On what side did your ancestors fight in an important war? Has anyone in your family been to prison? Are you the descendant of knights? Royalty? The answers to these questions can make for powerful discoveries.  Don't just look through your own documents and memorabilia, look through the leavings of your ancestors. Read their letters back and forth, written during wartime. Read their journals and diaries, making copies of everything to archive the objects safely, especially if you're dealing with delicate documents that are very old.   At the very least, it's a great idea to look through old photographs. Nothing can jog stronger emotions and powerful nostalgia quicker than seeing your grandparents wedding day, or seeing your parents as children. Spend time with old photographs. Every family needs a reliable archivist, someone who takes charge of looking over the family's documents. If you've got an interest in digging around in the past, start taking on this responsibility. Learn everything you can about your family, your history, and yourself.  Lots of nonfiction books are planned beforehand, plotting an exciting change in your life, travel, or project to document with a book. It can be a great way to generate material. If you're worried that not much exciting has happened to you in your life, consider making a big change and writing a proposal to get it funded.   Try being a fish out of water. If you're a city-dweller, see what would happen if you moved to the country for a year and decided to eat only food that you could grow. Spend a year researching farming methods and homesteading skills, propose the project, and strap on your gardening gloves. You could also travel to a turbulent location, getting a gig teaching overseas, somewhere exciting and unfamiliar to you. Write about your experience being there. Try to give something up for a long period of time, like throwing away your garbage, or eating processed sugar, and document your experience of this experiment. If you have an exciting enough proposal, lots of publishers will advance you some money and a contract if you've got a good track record of publishing, or if you've gotten a really great idea for a non-fiction project.  Before you get started on your own, see how other writers have approached the task of recording their lives in print. Some of the best writing comes from writers taking on the challenge of their own lives. Some classic autobiographies and memoirs include:    Townie by Andre Dubus III  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou  The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X and Alex Haley  Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood by Marjane Satrapi  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers Life" by Keith Richards  Me by Katherine Hepburn  Another Bullshit Night in Suck City by Nick Flynn  , The hardest thing about writing an autobiography or memoir is in finding the core of your story. At the worst, an autobiography can be a rambling series of boring details, flying by whole months and years without any interesting or specific details to hold up the story for itself. Or, an autobiography can elevate mundane details to feel important, profound, and grave. It's all got to do with finding the emotional core of your story and keeping it at the forefront of your story. What is your story? What is the most significant part of your life that needs to be told?   Picture your whole life, as you've lived it, like a beautiful mountain range off in the distance. If you want to give people a tour of your mountains, you could rent a helicopter and fly over it in 20 minutes, pointing to little things in the distance. Or you could take them on a hiking trip through the mountains, showing them the nitty-gritty, the up-close, and the personal. That's what people will want to read.  If you're struggling to find the relatable part of your life, start thinking of big changes in your life. What's the difference between the way you used to be and the way you are now? How have you grown up? What obstacles or struggles have you overcome?   Quick exercise: Write up a short one-page portrait of yourself 5 years ago, 30 years ago, or even a couple of months ago, if necessary–however long you need to account for a significant change in yourself. What would you have been wearing? What would have been your major goal in life? What would you have been doing on an average Saturday night? In Dubus' Townie, the author recounts what it was like growing up in a college town, where his estranged father worked as a successful and famous novelist and professor. He, though, lived with his mother, doing drugs, getting into fights, and struggling with his identity. His transformation from being an out-of-control, anger-obsessed "townie" to a successful writer (like his father) forms the core of the story.  Every good story needs a strong supporting cast of other characters to round out the narrative. Although it's your life that will form the main structure and focus of the autobiography, nobody wants to read a self-absorbed rant. Who are the most important other characters in your story?   Quick exercise: Write up a one-page character sketch of each member of your family, focusing on questions you've asked of yourself, or asked others about yourself for research. What is your brother's most crowning achievement? Is your mother a happy person? Is your father a good friend? If your friends are more significant in your autobiography than your family, focus more on them. It's important to keep your list of main characters as small as possible, and "blend" characters, if necessary. While all the boys you used to hang out with at the bar, or all the people you used to work with may be important at some point in the story, throwing 10 new names at us every two pages will quickly overwhelm your reader. It's a common writer's technique to blend them into a single character to avoid burdening the reader with too many different names. Pick one main character per important setting.  What will the setting of your autobiography be? Where do the most important dramatic shifts, or events, or changes take place? In what way has that placed shaped you and your story? Think both in terms of the geography and in terms of the specifics–your country and your state might be just as important as your street, or your neighborhood.   Quick exercise: Write down everything you associate with your hometown, or the region you're from. Do you identify as a Midwesterner, if you're from Iowa, or do you identify as an Iowan? When people ask you about where you're from, are you embarrassed to describe it? Proud? If you've moved around a lot, consider focusing on the most distinctive, memorable, or critical-to-the-story locations. Mikal Gilmore's Shot in the Heart, which chronicles a life on the move and his tumultuous relationship with his brother, the convicted murderer Gary Gilmore, involves dozens of moves and living spaces, but will often summarize them, rather than dramatizing them.  The difference between a successful and unsuccessful autobiography is whether or not you'll be able to limit the scope into a single, unifying idea, or whether the amount of different details will overwhelm the story. No one can include their entire life in a story. Some things will have to be left out. Deciding what those things will be can be just as important as deciding what will go in.   An autobiography is a record of the entire life of the writer, while a memoir is a document that covers a very specific story, period of time, or aspect of the writer's life. Memoirs are more versatile, especially if you're young. An autobiography written at the age of 18 might be somewhat tedious, but a memoir could be great.If you want to write an autobiography, you need to pick a unifying theme to carry through the story. Maybe your relationship with your father is the most important part of your story, or your military experience, or your struggle with addictions, or your rock-solid faith and the difficulty in holding onto it.  When you start getting some sense of what you think your autobiography or memoir might include and where you might go with it, it's helpful for many writers to write up a rough outline of where the story will go. Unlike in fiction, where you've got to invent the plot, you already will have some sense of where your story might end, or what will come next. Outlining can be a helpful way of looking at the major plot points all at once and deciding what to emphasize and what to summarize.Chronological autobiographies work from birth to adulthood, following closely to the order of events as they occurred in your life, while thematic and anecdotal autobiographies will jump around, telling stories based around particular themes. Some writers prefer to let whim drive the car, and not a complicated outlined plan for the plot. Johnny Cash's autobiography Cash wanders around his story, starting at his home in Jamaica, then going back in time, constantly shifting around like a good late-night conversation on the front porch with an old timer. It's a wonderful and familiar way of structuring an autobiography, impossible to outline.  The biggest secret that successful writers, novelists, and memoirists have about the process? There is no secret. You just sit down and start working. Every day, Try to write some more of your autobiography. Get some more out on the page. Treat it like you're mining raw material out of the earth. Get everything out, as much as possible. Worry about whether or not it's good later. Try to surprise yourself before your work is done.   Ron Carlson, a novelist and story writer, calls this commitment "staying in the room." While you might want to get up and grab a cup of coffee, or fiddle with your record player, or take the dog for a walk, the writer stays in the room and sticks with the difficult part of the story. That's where the writing happens. Stay in the room and write.  Many a writing project has faltered due to lack of production. It's hard to sit down at the desk every day and actually get some words on the page, but it can be a lot easier for some people to write up a schedule and try to stick to it. Decide how much you'd like to produce on a daily basis and Try to meet that level every day. 200 words? 1200 words? 20 pages? It's up to you and your work habits.   You might also decide on a set amount of time you can commit to the project every day and not worry about a number of words or pages. If you've got a solid 45 minutes of quiet after you get home from work, or before you go to bed at night, set aside that time to work on your autobiography undisturbed. Stay focused and do as much as you can.  If you want to write an autobiography but aren't thrilled about the idea of actually writing, or if you struggle with things like vocabulary and grammar, it might be more appropriate to record yourself "talking" your story, and transcribe it later. Get yourself a good drink, a quiet room, and a digital recorder and hit the green button. Let the stories flow.   It might be helpful to have someone to talk to, treating the recording process more like an interview. It can be weird to just talk into a microphone by yourself, but if you're a great raconteur with lots of hilarious stories to tell, it might put you in your own element to have a close friend or relative to talk with and lob questions at you. Most rockstar autobiographies, or memoirs written by people who aren't professional writers, are "written" this way. They'll record interviews, telling stories and anecdotes from their lives, and then put it together with a ghostwriter who oversees the actual writing of the book. It may seem like cheating, but it works.  Memories are unreliable. Most real-life stories don't fit together with the simplicity and the elegance of fiction, but writers have a tendency to let narrative guidelines and rules affect memories, polishing them and fitting them into the story. Don't worry so much about whether or not the story you're telling is 100% accurate, worry about whether or not it rings true in the emotional sense of the story.   Sometimes, you might remember two important conversations with your friend Craig, both times over pizza at your favorite place. Maybe they happened on two separate nights two years apart, but for the purposes of the story it'd be a lot easier to make it all one conversation. Is there any harm in doing so, if it tidies up the narrative? Probably not. There's a difference between cleaning up the messy details in your memory and straight-up making stuff up. Don't invent people, places, or problems. No outright lies.  Every writer has an internal critic perched on their shoulder. That critic complains, finds everything too cliché, shouting insults into the writers ear. Tell that critic to can it. When you're first getting started, it's important to uncensor yourself as much as possible. Just write. Don't worry about whether or not what you're writing is perfect, whether each sentence is immaculate, whether or not people are going to be interested. Just write. Do the important work of cleaning it up in revision.   At the end of each writing period, look back at what you've written and then make changes, or better yet let your writing sit on the shelf for a while before you do anything to make changes.  If you're going along and writing your story, you might eventually get stuck and find yourself at a loss for where to go next. Time to get creative. Use all your research and the documents you've collected to wrestle something out of yourself onto the page. Treat it like a collage, or an art project, more than a "book."   Dig out a picture of your family from the era yore writing about and write about what you imagine each character was thinking at the moment the picture was taken? Write it. Let someone else talk for a while. If you've done some interviews with family members, write in one of their voices for a while. Transcribe an interview you conducted and get their input on the page. Imagine the life of an important object. Make your grandfather's brass knuckles he brought back from WWII be the point-of-view character for an argument between he and your father. Sit with your father's coin collection and imagine his collecting them, his feeling them, his looking through them. What did he see?  , When you're writing narrative prose, it's important to learn to distinguish between writing scenes and writing summaries. Good writing is paced according to its ability to summarize periods of time in narration and at a distance, and to slow down certain important moments and display them in scenes. Think of summary like montage in a movie, and scenes like particular exchanges of dialog.   Example of summary: "We moved around a lot that summer. It was all scraped knees and gas station hot dogs, the hot leather in the back of dad's '88 Suburban. We fished at Raccoon Lake, got leeches at Diamond Lake, and visited grandma in Kankakee. She gave us kids a jar of pickles to split while dad got drunk in the backyard, fell asleep, and ended up with the god of all sunburns lobstering across his back." Example of scene: "We heard the dog whine and Grandma opened the screen door a crack to look out at him, but we could see she held her foot against the bottom of it, like she was scared of something she saw. Her hands were still covered in globs of pie dough and her face was like a mask. She said, 'Bill Jr. you touch that dog again and I'm calling the police.' We stopped eating pickles. The pickles seemed ridiculous, suddenly. We waited to hear what she would say next."  , Good writing is made of luminous particulars and specific details. Bad writing is made of abstractions. The more specific and detail-oriented you can make your writing, the better off your autobiography will be. Try to make each important scene as long as possible, get everything out of it that you possibly can. If it ends up being too much, you can always cut it back later.   If the emotional core of your story revolves around your relationship with your father, you could give us 50 pages of a systematic takedown of his worldview, railing against his small-mindedness, or misogyny, or tyrannical ranting, but you might lose a lot of us three pages in. Instead, focus on things that we can see. Describe his after-work routine. Describe the way he said things to your mother. Describe the way he ate his steak. Give us particular details.  Most inexperienced writers over-use dialog, writing whole pages of exchanges between characters. Writing dialog is very difficult, especially in an autobiographical project. Only use dialog when characters absolutely need to speak, and summarize all other spoken language. Aim for no more than one exchange of dialog for every 200 words of summary and narration.   When you're writing a scene, the dialog should be used to move the scene forward, and should also be used to show us something about how the character is experiencing the scene. Maybe it's important for the grandmother character that she be the one to stand up to Jay Jr. and tell him to stop. Maybe that's a big important change in the drama.  There are no "good guys" and "bad guys" in real life, and they shouldn't show up in good writing. Memory has a tendency to colonize our opinions, and it can be easy to erase the good qualities of an ex-girlfriend, or only remember the good parts of college friends. Try to paint an even-handed portrait though, and your writing will be better off for it.   There should be no straight-up evil characters that show up in autobiography, they need to have motivations and attributes all their own. If Bill Jr. is a drunken dog-beater, there needs to be a good reason why, not just because he's Satan reincarnate. Let "good" characters have moments of embarrassment, or failures of character. Show them in failure so we can see them in success and appreciate them more for it.  Keep to your production schedule as much as possible. There'll probably be days that you won't feel like writing much, but try to keep going. Find the next scene, the next chapter, the next story. Jump around if you need to, or go back to the research well to jog something else loose.   If you have to put your writing aside for a while, so be it. You can always live a little more, gain some more perspective, and return to the book with fresh eyes. An autobiography can be an ever-changing thing. Keep living your life and writing new chapters.	Start documenting. Interview your family and friends. Travel and talk to long-lost relatives. Go to the family archives. Consider planning an exciting project to write into your autobiography. Read other autobiographies. Find the emotional truth of your story. Name the way in which you've been changed. Write a list of the important characters in your story. Decide where most of the story will take place. Limit the scope of the book. Start with a rough outline. Just start writing. Write up a production schedule. Consider recording your story and transcribing it later. Let yourself remember incorrectly. Tell off the "cool police.", Incorporate as many other elements into your autobiography as possible. Understand the difference between scene and summary. Write small and write specifically. Use dialog sparingly. Be generous. Stick with it.
Cast on 16 stitches., Work 4 rows in moss stitch. Continue in stocking stitch until the pocket measures 12 centimeter (4.7 in), ending with a knit row. Cast off in knit stitch. Cut the yarn, leaving sufficient to sew up.	Pocket. Border.
Make a figure of 8 with your first rubber band and poke your index finger through one hole and your middle finger through the other.  This time, don't twist them to make a figure 8. Instead, simply slide them over your fingers in an 0 shape.  Take one side of the bottom band and bring it up and over your finger, and then drop it so that it rests on top of the other two rubber bands, in between your fingers. Do the same with the other side.  Place it on top of the last one, spread between your fingers. Make sure you do this after each step, so that there are always three rubber bands on your fingers.  Pull one end up over your finger and drop it over the rubber bands in the middle, and repeat with the other side. Then add another rubber band to your fingers.  You will quickly see a fishtail pattern forming between your fingers; this will be your bracelet. Keep weaving the rubber bands until the bracelet is big enough to fit around your wrist.  Take the two bottom bands and pull them over so that you only have one around your fingers. Then slip the loose ends onto a C or S clip, and do the same with the loose end on the bottom of the bracelet.	Use two fingers as a loom, and set up your first band. Place another two rubber bands on top. Bring the bottom rubber band over the top of the other two. Add another rubber band. Again, bring the bottom band over the others. Keep repeating this pattern. Finish your bracelet. Experiment with different color and weaving patterns to create lots of different rubber band bracelets.
, Lifting the vehicle allows more freedom for the tires to move under the wheel wells.  Higher quality suspension systems like Jeep's Rubicon or Rubicon Express allow the axles and tires to articulate and move in relation to objects, thereby supplying much improved traction.        The most common lift ranges are 1-4 inches (3-10 cm). If you do not lift the vehicle, there is reduced body-to-tire clearance and increased risk of damage to the undercarriage, frame and suspension. On the other hand, too much lift will cause the vehicle to be top heavy and is, generally, not very practical.  Skid plates, "Nerf" bars and roll cages can help protect you and your vehicle while out on the trail.    Large tires add extra ground clearance and allow for a smoother ride and better handling. Surfaces of the trails greatly and these may require differing tread designs. The universal or "knobby" tires are a minimum requirement and provide a good starting tire for most off roading trails. Tires ranging from 29 to 35 inches (75-90 cm) in height will be sufficient for most off-roading adventures. These tires are also designed to run at a very low pressure (5-15psi or 35-100kPa). Low tire pressures are preferred for flexing around tight spots and corners in the trail. The low pressures generally give more traction and the tires are less likely to be punctured by sharp rocks and other debris.  Many trails can be found in books, online and through your local group or club. Trails range greatly in difficulty: The novice should start with easy or medium trails.   Easy trails are usually just basic off-asphalt trails and require no technical or extraordinary handling experience. Any four wheel drive (FWD) or all wheel drive (AWD) vehicle should be able to easily navigate these trails. Medium difficulty trails will likely be relatively mild with no extreme grades and only a few more technical obstacles. A small SUV is recommended,— one, preferably, with after market tires and/or suspension. Hard trails should be left to the well seasoned and experienced off roader. Once your vehicle is prepared with after market tires and suspension, the vehicle should be outfitted with a roll cage. Roll cages should be considered a necessity and should be installed before you attempt this class of difficulty.  Rocks can move, boulders can be slippery and water driving can be tricky. Each can be more intense than anticipated.  Observe the terrain, obstacles and upcoming features closely and react with a level head. Going slowly allows you more time to react to your changing environment. Remember, off-roading isn't a race. It requires technical driving, some finesse and large measures of patience and restraint to maintain a constant, slow speed and "crawl" the terrain successfully., Try tackling some hills and a couple of rock beds. They offer a slippery surface and a stiffer challenge when attempting to crawl your vehicle. Once you build confidence and ability, your off-road driving experience can go one of two ways.— It will only get easier or it will become more challenging ans intense. The choice is yours. You should look expand your horizons and attempt new challenges.  When driving on more challenging rock beds, always have a spotter outside your vehicle to help you with wheel placement. A spotter is a person that looks for what you are unable to see from inside the vehicle and will help guide wheel placement.       When driving on sand, snow or ice, loss of control is also a possibility. Drive much more slowly than normal and use snow chains or studded tires to greatly improve performance and ease of handling. On these surfaces, you will need to keep tires from spinning by providing the best traction possible and changing your speed gradually. That is, accelerate from a dead stop to speed and decelerate from speed to a stop should be slow, even and gradual.       On sand, knobby tires can greatly increase traction. As the tires spin, they act as paddles to propel you forward or backward. Still, no matter the tire type, you cannot spin too much. There is a very real danger of sinking your tires in the sand and it can happen before you know it. Increase your awareness and, if this starts to happen, stop before you are more than a few inches deep (especially if you aren't actually moving any at all). Try backing up, or rocking the vehicle out of the depression before it becomes a crater.  The best way to learn how to traverse all kinds of obstacles and surfaces is to try it— learn by doing. Up the difficulty of your playground and don't be discouraged if things become tougher than you expected. Respond to the challenges as best you can, then listen to the experienced off-roaders. They may offer suggestions about how to better spend your time on the trail or to more easily surmount recent challenges you have faced.   If you are unable to complete a section of the trail, other drivers on the trail will probably be willing to help you navigate the obstacles by spotting or will give you advice. Forcing your way through an obstacle or trail, may damage your vehicle. Remember: Your vehicle should survive the ordeal with little or no damage and live to off road another day. Your vehicle will be needed to carry you and yours safely home from the trail and is likely used around town too, so avoid powering through difficult situations.	Purchase a reliable off road vehicle, such as a Jeep Wrangler. , Adapt the vehicle by lifting the vehicle, that is, adjusting the suspension. Install accessory items to improve safety and vehicle toughness. Purchase large tires. Take your vehicle to a legal off-roading trail. Start out slowly until you get the hang of the terrain. Remain calm in all situations. Build your skill and confidence. Experience as many terrains and trails as possible.
Cover surfaces like trim, windows, and floors with drop cloth. The drop cloth is suitable for painting since it absorbs paint easily and allows for smooth painting.At this point it is safest to clear the floor of any potential tripping hazard that could catch on the sprayer hose.  Wooden sticks are commonly provided with purchased paint and work well with mixing. To strain, a simple and effective method is using scrap window screen.This will remove any foreign particles or lumps and guarantee a smooth coat.   Use a Two-Part Epoxy Primer as they are waterproof, resist corrosion, and offer the best level of adhesion for metal and industrial painting., Hanging your pieces gives you closer to a 360º access while painting. This will also work well for bottled spray paint. If however you do not have access to a stand, simply spray the pieces over an ample piece of drop cloth.  Allow them to dry, and add a second coat.If using bottled spray paint, apply the primer as evenly as possible all around the metal part.  Store your primer in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area. Also check to ensure the seal on your container is air-tight. Primer will not expire if properly stored, but it will evaporate if not securely sealed. Also keep in mind that primer is flammable and should be kept away from open flames, points of ignition, and temperatures over 100ºF.  Make sure to remove your compressed air source and air regulator before you begin cleaning. It is important that a spray gun is thoroughly cleansed before you switch to a new substance, so follow the related wikiHow's instructions closely before moving on.  More often than not, paint stores will be glad to provide a wooden paddle for stirring. Be sure to ask for one with your purchase. As with the primer, using scratch window screen is an effective and simple way to filter out any lumps or foreign particles from your paint., There are a few keys to keep in mind while painting. Maintain a distance of about 6 inches between the tip of the spray gun and the material surface. Using a sweeping motion that goes side to side while painting. If the spray gun is not in motion, then do not pull the trigger. This can lead to uneven, blotchy painting.Allow the paint to dry completely; this often takes 20 minutes to an hour for each coat.  The clear-coat finish will also protect the chrome against rust and dust. Follow the same tips you did in the previous step.  You can then buff the chrome exterior using a buffing cloth and buffing compound to give it a glossy shine.	Guard your workspace from unintended painting. Mix your primer and strain it to prevent any clogs in the spray gun's tip and internal filters. Hang or position any pieces to be painted on a metal stand. Evenly coat the pieces with Two-Part Epoxy Primer using your spray gun. Properly store any left over primer by pouring it from the spray gun's paint cup into its original container. Clean the spray gun properly before adding your chosen paint. Mix and strain any paint to be used with the spray gun. Apply your chosen automotive paint. Give the chrome a polished appearance by applying 3 coats of automotive clear-coat paint. Wait for approximately 3 days until the automotive clear-coat paint has dried.

A lot can go a long way, so you only need about 1 to 2 tsp (5 to10 ml) of ketchup, at most.   Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results. Tomato juice is a mild acid, so the use of tomato-based products can help dissolve debris causing tarnish and dullness on your brass. Ketchup is your best option since it is so thick, but in the absence of ketchup, you could also try tomato paste or tomato juice.  Wipe the sides of the brass object down with the ketchup-covered cloth, coating all sides in the ketchup.   For best results, rub the ketchup on in a single direction instead of rubbing it on in a back-and-forth motion or a circular motion.  Use a damp cloth to wipe off the ketchup after allowing the tomato substance to sit on the surface for a couple of minutes.   You could also rinse the brass under running water to get the ketchup off, but using a damp cloth provides the added benefit of a little extra buffing.  Use a dry, soft cloth to dry off any remaining moisture while giving the brass a final shine. Thoroughly buff the entire surface by passing over it in small, circular motions.	Squirt a dollop of ketchup onto a soft cloth. Rub the surface of the brass with the ketchup. Wipe off the residue. Buff until dry and shiny.
Guitar straps come in a wide variety of styles and sizes - some are audacious, some are plain, some are thick and padded, others are thin "seat belt"-style straps. Check out the selection at your local music store or in classified ads to get a sense of the options available to you. Below are just a few things you'll want to consider when picking out a strap:   Material - Many of the most affordable straps are made from the aforementioned seat belt-style material, but for a little more cash, it's possible to buy durable all-leather straps. Size - Not usually a major concern because the vast majority of guitar straps are adjustable, but you'll still want to be sure the strap is at least long enough to allow comfortable playing while standing up. Padding - Some guitar straps incorporate padding into the part of the strap that is slung over your shoulder to make playing more comfortable. This is usually made from foam, but sometimes fur or other materials are used. Aesthetics - Guitar straps come in a huge variety of colors and designs. Pick one that's right for your "sound".; , Guitar straps typically have leather (or fake leather) ends in the shape of rounded triangles. On each end should be a small hole with a slit cut in the side of it. These holes will support the weight of your guitar while you play.  Almost all electric guitars have two small knobs that fit into the holes on the strap. The first of these is at the base of the guitar's body - in other words, if you stand the guitar up vertically, it will be at the "bottom" of the guitar. This knob typically sticks out about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) depending on what type of guitar you have. Slip the hole that is farther from the strap's belt-like tightening/loosening buckle over this knob.          To ensure comfort during playing, ensure that you slip the strap hole over the knob so that the fitting buckle faces outwards - otherwise, it may dig into your shoulder.  Look at the spot where the neck of the guitar meets the body. Nearly all electric guitars will have a knob near here. Slip the second strap-hole - the one that's closer to the buckle used to adjust the strap - over this knob. Put the other end of the strap on this knob.  Congratulations - your guitar is now "strapped up". Now, it's time to test out the strap. If you are right-handed, sling the strap over your left shoulder so that the guitar hangs in front of you, allowing you to strum with your right hand and fret with your left. If you are left-handed, do the reverse - sling the strap over your right shoulder.  Now, ensure your strap fits comfortably and doesn't inhibit your movement by playing a few simple chords or songs. Try playing in a variety of ways - standing up, sitting down, and even kneeling or laying down, for instance.  When you play with a strap, you want your playing to come as easily and as naturally as it would without one. This means that your strap should allow the guitar to hang at such a height that you can strum and fret as you normally would. Use the strap's adjustable buckle to change the length of the strap as needed for your comfort and ease of playing.	Find a strap that's right for you. Find the holes on either end of the strap. Connect the strap to the knob at the base of your guitar's body. Slip the other hole on the strap over the second knob. Slip the strap over your shoulder. Test your strap out by playing. Adjust the strap's length as needed.
larger than your leaf. Place sheeting on the ground. Make sure area is clear of debris and additional leaves. Also, this project works best in an area that is free of any moisture.; , Make sure the leaf is centered and the veins are face up.  Working quickly, use gloved hands to integrate concrete mixture together. Spread mixture over the leaf until you achieve a thickness of approximately 2.5 to 4 centimeter (1.0 to 1.6 in).   Smooth hand over concrete to remove air bubbles and create a flat surface.  Cut wire to within 5 centimeter (2.0 in). of the edge, overlapping pieces if necessary.   Add more concrete over the chicken wire, spread again to a 2.5 to 4 centimeter (1.0 to 1.6 in). thickness. Smooth your hand over the top to remove bubbles.  The plastic will remain in place as the design cures and dries, which could take up to 48 hours.   Add a second piece of plastic over the top of the design to ensure it cures properly and does not simply dry out.  If you worked in a humid environment, the leaf may have already decomposed and broken down.   Use a hose with jet spray nozzle to remove remaining leaf pieces.  You can place the stones in the desired area, but avoid walking on them until the curing process has finished.	Cut plastic sheeting that is approximately 15 centimeter (5.9 in). Place leaf on top of plastic sheeting. Mix concrete according to package directions and then apply directly to leaf. Cut chicken wire to leaf size and place over to the top of the concrete covered leaf. Wrap edges and leaf in the remaining portion of the plastic, taking care to adhere plastic to design with fingers. Peel away small pieces of leaf once design has cured. Spray stones over the next several days as the curing process takes nearly a week to complete.
This is a simple snake that you can make out of a paper plate. It lays flat on your table, but springs up into a long snake when you hang it! Here's a list of what you will need:   Paper plate Acrylic or tempera paint Paintbrushes, spongers, etc Pencil or pen Scissors Crayons, markers, or googly eyes Red paper or ribbon White school glue or tacky glue String, thumbtack, hole punch (optional) Rhinestones, glitter, etc (optional); , Be sure not to go too far into the middle or else it may not be big enough.   If you don't have a paper plate, use a small plate to trace a circle onto a large sheet of paper. Cut the circle out using a pair of scissors, and use that circle instead.  You can paint the snake however you want. You can use a paintbrush, a sponge, or even your fingers. Snakes come in many different colors and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Paint the plate a solid color and let the paint dry. Next, dip a sponge into a different color and tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel. Then, dab the sponge all over the plate. If you want to add another color, wait for the first one to dry. This will give you a scale-like effect.Wrap a sheet of bubble wrap (bubble-side-out) around a rolling pin and secure it with tape. Pour two colors of paint onto a palette and gently roll the pin across. Next, roll the pin across the plate. You will get a scale effect.You can also color the other side of the plate to make the snake's belly. Most snakes have a plain, light colored belly. Do this once the top of the snake dries., Make the spiral about half an inch thick. It doesn't have to be perfect, but try to make it even all the way around. The center of the spiral will be the snake's head, so make it rounded.   You are drawing the spiral on the back so that you won't see it on the top.  Start front the outside of the spiral, and work your way in. Try to do this right on the line, because you don't want the line to show on the finished product.  At this point, you can paint on some extra designs to make your snake even more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Paint thick stripes across the spiral to make a striped snake. Paint Xs or diamond shapes across the spiral to make a diamond pattern. Glue some colorful rhinestones using white school glue or tacky glue.Try not to add too many, or your snake will be too heavy. Make some squiggles and patterns on the snake using white glue. Then, shake some glitter onto the glue. Tap off the excess glitter and let the glue dry.  You can draw the eyes on using a marker or crayons. You can also paint the eyes on. If you have googly eyes at home, you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue.   Remember, the head is the rounded part in the middle of the spiral.  Cut a thin 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08) long rectangle out of red paper. You can also use a piece of thin, red ribbon. Cut a V shape into one end of the rectangle. This will be the snake's forked tongue. Lift the head up and glue the tongue under it.  You can punch the hole at the end of the tail, right between the eyes, or even in the tongue. Thread a piece of string through the hole and tie it in a knot. Use the other end of the string to hang the snake from a door knob, a stick, or even a thumbtack in the wall.	Gather your supplies. Cut off the raised edge of a paper plate. Paint or decorate the paper plate. Draw a spiral on the back of the plate. Cut out the spiral shape. Add more decorations to the snake. Add the eyes onto the front of the head. Add the tongue. Punch a hole through the snake if you want to hang it.
If you’ve got foggy windows in the summer, turn down your air conditioner. This will warm up your car and get the inside air temperature to match the outside a bit better. You can also open your windows a bit to allow more outside air in (and it prevents your car from becoming too stifling)., If the fog is on the outside of your windshield (as it will be during the summer), you can remove it with your windshield wipers. Simply turn them on to their lowest setting and let them run until the fog is gone., This is a quick way to get the temperature inside your car to match the temperature outside. Roll down your windows as far as you can so that the warm air outside gets into the cool interior of your car.	Turn down the AC if it’s warm outside. Turn on your windshield wipers. Open your windows.
The tub has to be able to fit the cymbal in it. If the water in your tub is too hot or too cold, it will ruin the cymbal and possibly crack it. Make sure that the water in your tub is nice and warm. A good mix is 1/3 of cold water and 2/3 of hot water. To test the water, stick your hand in the tub. Your hand shouldn't get cold but it shouldn't burn either. It should feel like a relaxing bath.; , Take your cymbal off it's stand and gently lay it down into the tub. It should be face up like you'd have it mounted on your stand. The cymbal doesn't have to be soaking in the tub for hours, just leave it in there for 1-3 minutes. This will help loosen visible dirt and will help with the rest of the polishing process. Leaving the cymbal in the tub for too long can damage it so be sure to not leave it in there for longer than three minutes.  To dry the cymbal, take it out of the tub and lay it on a dry towel. With another separate, small cloth, pat the cymbal dry. Don't hit the cymbal really hard, a small and light pat will do. For one or two minutes, focus on getting the cymbal dry by patting it. Never scrub the cymbal as this can completely ruin the sound and looks of it.  Put some cymbal polish (whatever one you've chosen) on a small, dry, clean cloth. Clean a small area of the drum cymbal and wait for the polish to soak in. If you try to clean the whole cymbal in one go, the polish will dry and become very hard to remove. If you're not sure about what way to clean the cymbal (I.e, Clockwise or Anti-clockwise) just keep in mind that you need to follow the grooves engraved in the cymbal. Keep repeating this step until you've cleaned the whole cymbal.  Dip another small, clean cloth into the lukewarm water tub and gently wipe the polish off. You still want to follow the grooves in the cymbal and you should avoid scrubbing the cymbal too hard. Every time you rinse off a small part of the cymbal, dry it using the same technique described in step 3. Keep repeating this step until the whole cymbal is rinsed and dried and you're pretty much done. Enjoy your shiny, new cymbals!	Fill the tub with lukewarm water. Soak the cymbal. Dry the cymbal. Apply the polish. Rinse off the polish.
Racing your car on public roads is dangerous and illegal. You will also have a lot more fun on a track that is made for speed and safety. Search on the Internet (see "External Links" below) or look in a phone book.       ; , Call the racetrack on the phone and ask when they will be hosting a "Driver's Education" event or when it will be open for the public. You should not race your car until participating in a Driver's Education event. If the track knows of none, search on the Internet for "motorsports clubs" in your area. If you have a car with a racing heritage like Audi, Porsche, BMW, Subaru, etc., search for that club (i.e., Porsche Club of America). When you go to any track, if there is classroom time, avail yourself of the wisdom which will be imparted. Many racers began their careers participating in autocross events. Contact the local NASA (National Auto Sport Association) or do an online search.  On the day of your first Driver's Education event, check all of the mechanics of your car including oil (which should be topped off), tire pressure (a few PSI higher than normal-ask the instructor or another participant), tire tread, steering fluid, brake fluid and brakes. If you are not experienced in doing a safety check on your car, take it to a mechanic and tell the mechanic you plan on racing the car. When you get to the track, check the tire pressure and oil again. Look under "Things You'll Need" (below) for a list of items to bring to the track.  Every event has different rules. One common rule is a prohibition on passing, among the most dangerous of racing moments. Find out the rules from the event organizer.  Feel the track. Be the track. On the track, go around twice at a normal rate of speed to get the lay of the land; if possible, get out and walk the track paying special attention to the turns. Commit the track to memory by drawing it on paper, noting turn-in and track-out points. Do a drive-through with an instructor if at all possible. Don't be scared of the track (AKA: An "O'Gorman"), but give it the proper caution and respect.  When you first go on track at speed, follow an experienced driver. Every turn is approached with a minds-eye view of entry & exit and understanding of apexes. The prime apex point is the point in the center of the turn which will produce the fastest exit speed. Depending on track conditions(debris)and traffic you may need to use an early or late apex. You want to maintain as shallow an arc from your entry (turn-in point) to the exit (track-out)point. You should always maximize the amount of road surface used.  Rather than braking incrementally when going into a curve, it is best to be going as fast as you are prepared to and to then brake fast. This does not mean slamming on your brakes to the point where you could go into a spin (a common mistake) but it does mean knowing when to brake at the last possible moment. Braking can be practiced daily on interstate off-ramps, etc. Braking is usually done to impending lock-up. With ABS, you simply stand on the brakes. Braking can slow the car to the speed necessary to successfully negotiate a turn as well as settle the car at turn-in or when used in combination with steering and acceleration can cause the car to begin to rotate in order to carry more speed into a corner. A teacher familiar with the track can tell you exactly when you should start braking and turning and even where your car should be positioned going into turns.  Or you can start drifting if you know how to and take a steady and compressive turn and go out of it without losing much speed.  If you are driving under "No Pass" rules, this usually means that passing is still allowed if consent is given. Ask first. If this is the case, ask for the signal to show your consent. You should not be doing a lot of passing (or any passing) as a novice but you should be getting passed often. When you see a driver approaching rapidly, the driver may well be looking for your signal. It is important to be courteous by giving this signal whenever it is safe to do so. This signal is usually an arm point out straight to the left if you wish the driver to pass to your left or, if to the right, your arm out the window and bent over the roof pointing to your right. Give the signal clearly with your arm fully extended. Immediately upon giving the signal, make sure your car behaves as if it is ready to allow passage on the side you indicated. Do not point right and then track right. Stay in your line of travel. Only give a passing signal on straightaways.  While most tracks attach the same meaning to each flag, there is some local variation. Use this paragraph as a guide but be sure to check with the event organizer. The following will usually apply: A solid green flag means that the warm-up lap has ended and that passing may commence (when passing is allowed and then only according to rules of consent). A blue flag with a diagonal yellow stripe means that you need to allow the car behind you to pass. This is usually only shown when you have already failed to do the right thing without request. At the next passing zone, give the signal and hold your line. A stationary yellow means that there is some type of danger ahead. Slow down and use caution. A waving yellow means that there is a disabled car on the track. Slow down and prepare to go off your line to avoid the car. A flag with alternating yellow and red vertical stripes means that there is debris on the track (e.g., an oil slick). Slow down and watch for debris on the road. A black flag means that there is something wrong with your car. If the black flag is shown at all flag stations, it means that all cars are being called back to the pit, usually because there has been a crash or there is something else obstructing the track. Safely slow your vehicle, indicate to the flagger that you have seen the flag and pull into the pits for instruction from the track master. A red flag means you must stop your car immediately. Brake slowly and be aware that another car may be behind you. Come to a stop, preferably off to the side. Stay still and stay in your car. There may be emergency vehicles entering the track. Wait for instruction. A black flag with a yellow meatball means that the run group is about to end. Proceed through the checkered flag and slow to a cool-down lap.  The last run is called a "cool-down" lap because you are cooling down the brakes, which, by now, may be hot enough to melt rubber. Go slow and try not to use your brakes at all. Wave at all the corner workers. Use all of your fingers.  When you are driving, position your hands at 3:00 and 9:00 clock format. This will give you the best response time and best posture at high speeds.  Keep both front windows down. This is necessary so you can signal a pass and arguably safer in crashes where the glass breaking would otherwise cause injury. Also keep your radio off. You want to hear the noises your car is communicating to you, not your music.  You will be shocked at how difficult it is. Early in your development you will be assigned an instructor at each Driver's Education event. As you improve and the different organizations get to know you, you will be allowed to drive without on instructor.  You will be shocked at how fast you go through brake pads, rotors and tires. the additional strain on your car will have you replacing other unexpected items.  If you are especially clever, buy a dedicated track car that will easily join a popular and relatively inexpensive race class.  Each racing organization has a Competition School that is necessary to get your Novice License.	Find a racetrack. Get schooled. Perform a safety check. Learn the rules. See the track. Track to curb. Learn how to brake. Alternate of braking. How to be Passed. Learn and be mindful of the flags. Chill out. Steer correctly. Keep your windows down. Driving fast takes a lots of practice. It is an expensive pursuit. If you are smart and lucky you will recognize early that you've become addicted and will get your daily driver off of the track and buy a dedicated track car. After over 40 track days, you may begin think about racing.

There are four main kinds of backing up maneuvers you might come across in your large vehicle driving: straight back, offset back, alley dock, and parallel parking. Each of these can be identified by the following characteristics:    Straight back spots are usually located in a grid and form a perpendicular (L-shaped) angle with the traffic passage that vehicles pass through to go deeper into or exit from the parking area.  Offset back spaces are usually arranged in an offset grid. These meet the traffic passage vehicles use to enter into or exit the parking area at a diagonal angle.  Alley dock spaces are almost always for semi-trucks. These require you to move straight back through a narrow passage and then turn sharply to maneuver the trailer to meet a loading/unloading dock, which is usually at a right angle (L-shape) to the passage.  Parallel parking spaces are on the side of the road, with either traffic, obstacles, or empty spaces before or after the spot. These require you to back your vehicle in, and can be especially challenging. New drivers may want to avoid these if at all possible., This is going to be slightly different for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer versus large, normal trucks that have a bed attached to the cab. While large, attached-bed trucks will turn similarly to smaller vehicles you may be used to driving, these will require plenty of extra room to complete the turn. Semi-trucks/vehicles with trailers will turn backwards opposite the direction you turn your wheel.Getting the hang of backing up a semi-truck/vehicle with a trailer requires time and practice. You should consider finding an empty parking area and executing reverse maneuvers to get a feel for how your trailer responds to turning. If you are are prepping for a driving test or expect to have to reverse your large vehicle into a space, you should purchase some traffic cones from your local hardware store or set out some obstacles, like a cheap folding chair, in an empty parking area. This way you can practice avoiding and guiding your trailer/rear end around obstacles.  You'll want to pull several feet ahead of your parking spot to make sure your turn doesn't cut too sharp and hit parked vehicles in the near-side spot, or swing wide and hit vehicles parked in the far-side spot. The more distance between your large vehicle and the parked cars means you will have more distance to straighten your rear-end before approaching the parked vehicles. This extra room can be the difference between scraping up another car and sliding into your spot without incident.   Roll down your mirrors on both the driver and passenger side of your vehicle. You want as clear and as unobstructed a view as possible of your mirrors. Do this especially it it's raining, as raindrops can negatively impact your perspective or obstruct your view. Ask any passengers to step out of the vehicle. Even well-behaved passengers can be difficult to see around while backing up. A clear line of sight will help you prevent potential damage to your vehicle or others.  Your mirrors should give you a general sense of the dimensions of the area you will be parking in. However, mirrors can sometimes distort distance or miss important features, like thin metal signs, posts, and so on. Take note of the surroundings in your mirrors and step outside of your vehicle. Then:   Compare your walk-around evaluation of the parking area to your mirror view. Note any inconsistencies, difficult to see obstacles, or missed obstacles. Evaluate the size of the parking spot. If you feel that the spot might not be a good fit, or if you are nervous in your ability to park, you are probably better off finding another parking spot. Adjust your mirrors upon returning to your vehicle. Now that you have a more complete idea of the area in which you are parking, you can adjust your mirrors to give you a better perspective of the surrounding area you will be turning into. Your mirrors will normally be situated for straight-traffic driving, so adjusting these for a better parking view can help immensely., For attached-bed trucks as well, but especially for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer, you should swing your front-end in an outward arc away from your parking spot by cutting your wheel in the direction of the parking spot. This will allow the rear-end of your vehicle to cut sharply in the direction of the space you are attempting to park in. Once your rear-end is angled diagonally into the spot, straighten it by turning your wheel ¼ turn or less in the direction away from the spot.   The more space between you and the already parked vehicles/obstacles surrounding the spot in which you are attempting to park, the more time you'll have to align your rear end with the parking spot. This will give you more space to make small adjustments and guide your rear-end into the spot. Outside of your initial hard cut in the direction of the parking spot, which began the hard turn of your rear-end toward the spot, you should only make slight adjustments while backing up. Large adjustments will likely result in over- or under-steering. If you feel your angle of approach too far off, you should pull out and start again. You should keep a close eye on the front- and rear-end of your vehicle during these maneuvers. While swinging out wide with your cab to angle your rear-end into the spot, it's easy to swing out into cars parked in spots across from the one you are backing into., Once your rear end is aligned with the spot, your cab will likely still be at an angle to it. Allow your rear end to travel a few more feet into the spot, then turn your wheel in the direction you made your first hard cut - in the direction of the spot. This should begin straightening your cab without changing the angle of your rear-end. Use gentle steering corrections at this point; oversteering could result in the angle of your trailer/rear-end changing significantly.   Some spots are too narrow or are at too sharp of an angle for you to back into in one attempt. Even experienced large vehicle drivers sometimes need several tries before their vehicle is in the right position when backing into a spot. Adjust your vehicle as necessary. You may need to pull out of your spot, straighten your vehicle one more time, and reverse back into it, nice and even. When pulling out, be careful your rear-end does not cut short or wide into surrounding vehicles.	Identify your backing up maneuver. Understand the mechanics of backing up. Pull ahead of your spot. Check your mirrors and do a walk-around. Swing out wide with your cab. Straighten out your cab.
Look for strings you feel good playing on; it's important to be comfortable when you play.  This is optional. The goal is to get a better feel on your strings. In this way, your fingers will slide with greater ease. Beware though––this is only to help you, but don't overdo it, don’t apply too much “fast fret”!       , If you work without it, you will practice the technique but you will not keep the rhythm. If you do practice with one, be aware that you will not be able to use it in a band or a composition., If you only play with two fingers, start playing with your third finger on a song that you already know. Don’t play a high speed rhythm at the beginning. (Don’t start with Slayer’s Raining Blood, for example.)      , Just scrape the string with the tip of your fingers to be fast enough. If you lose power in the sound, you can use a boost or distortion pedal to offset it. It is also a good way to highlight your shred when you play it in a band!, Focus on your right hand (for right-handed players). The D or G strings are the best for training., Try to change the note when you play. After that, work on your right hand by changing the string you are playing.	Play on high quality, round-wound nickel strings. Apply “fast fret” to your strings. Work with a metronome so that you don't lose the rhythm. Learn to play with three fingers on a high speed rhythm (180 bpm). Play the strings perpendicular to the body when you're feeling comfortable with the technique. Train yourself by staying on only one note. Work on your left hand once you're able to shred on one note.
The soap can break up fat inside the clog, much the same way it dissolves grease in the kitchen sink.   If you cannot find dish washing soap, you can try shampoo or bits of bar soap. It will not be as effective as dish washing soap, but it may work.; ,,, This method is best if the bowl is not too full to begin with, since the soap will be more effective.	Squeeze several squirts of liquid dish washing soap into the toilet bowl. Pour 4 more cups (0.9l) of hot water into the toilet bowl to activate the soap.  , Wait 20 minutes.  , Turn the water valve on and flush the toilet.
Focus on a theme of your own. You might want to make it really original, like the Great Sith War or the New Republic. You can also visit many different places for different planets, or just make one in the setting.   A Jedi could be walking around the neighborhood then attacked by two Sith. Or, you could make the story more complicated by putting it before or after the movies, or even in between.; , Humor will improve the amateur movie, allowing for much forgiveness for the amateur setting and storyline! Add few jokes and punch lines to your movie. It wouldn't be a good one without it. Make sure that you understand people's styles, and make the humor fit to each of them.   Make your own funny scenes. For example:  Rebel 1 and rebel 2 are walking. Rebel 1 collapses. Rebel 2 calls his commanding officer. Rebel 2: "Sir, my partner collapsed and is not breathing, what should I do?" Commander: "Make sure he is dead, then tell me." Rebel 2 shoots rebel 1. Rebel 2: " Now what?".   Make a parody of the original movies. Parody is both fun and clever. Creating a parody script will teach you a lot about analyzing and writing.  You'll need this for the actors to follow and to know that your film has a fully fledged storyline.  You'll need at least one set to film against.   If you live near a city or in one you could make it in Coruscant (see episode 1,2,3). If you live in woods, it would be a good idea to make the movie in Kashyyk (see Episode 3) or Endor (see Episode 6). If you live in a place like Arizona (desert), you could make it on Tatooine (see Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). If in the mountains, make it on Hoth (see Episode 5). Or, if you live in the mountains with either forest or snow (never use both, unless you are creating your own planet), you can make forest moons like Endor or Yavin 4, or ice planets like Hoth. If you have a big field, you could make it Naboo (see Episode 1 or 2). If you live near a swamp, make it Dagobah (episode 5).  Do not just film the thing with toy lightsabers and guns and make swoosh sounds with your mouth. Download Lsmaker or FXhome visionlab Studio (both have a lightsaber effects program). Add other sound effects from the internet.  You can play it on your guitar but you can make it better by adding the real deal. You can get music from the internet as well.  This will depend on your budget and computer type; do the research to get the best for what you can afford.  Remember how Harrison Ford (aka, Han Solo) flew the Millenium Falcon in circles just to lose the Imperials in that asteroid field in "The Empire Strikes Back?" Well, to get characters with a good personality like Solo, you need actors with an equally good personality.   Don't try to use characters from the movies too much, they won't anything like the real thing at all (unless you have a really good makeup artist), and people will get confused. Try to make your own characters, or try to make the character you know and love from a different time (for example, you could make someone Luke Skywalker when he was growing up on Tatooine). Droids are recommended, but optional. If you decide to use droids, you can get some costumes, and if the color of it doesn't fit you, you can either bleach it or tie-dye it.  Get people who are happy with the camera, directing actors, making costumes, doing makeup, writing scripts, editing on the computer, etc. Wherever you have strengths, take on the role, otherwise find others to help you.  Include a lot of popcorn. And let it roll.	Come up with a plot. Make it funny. Produce a script. Make a set. Use good effects. Find suitable music. Use a good editing program to bring everything together. Get some actors. Assemble helpers for filming. Gather your family and friends together for a movie night.
Silk flowers cannot be dyed using fabric dye, because the fabric cannot be boiled. Although you can attempt using food coloring, it will likely rinse off the fabric because it is not permanent. The most success has come from dying silk flowers with acrylic paint. Therefore, you will need a tube of acrylic paint in a color of your choice, a container of gel medium, and water.  Depending on the type of silk flower you use, you may need to prepare them a bit. If your flower has a stamen in the center, you’ll need to use painters tape to block it off in order to prevent it from being dyed. Anything else you don’t want colored should be blocked off with painters tape as well.  To make the dye for your silk flowers, mix 2 parts acrylic paint with 1 part gel medium, Use a stir stick or spoon to fully incorporate this, and then add a small amount of water to thin it down. The amount of water you add to the mixture is dependent on how bright you want the dye to be; the more water you add, the paler the final color. When you’re done, put the dye in a wide-brimmed bowl or container, and place newspapers around it to prevent leaks.  Place a single flower in the dye, and hold it so that it is completely covered in the color. Carefully lift it out of the dye using the stem or tweezers (if there is no stem), and place it onto the newspapers. Use a paper towel to pat the flower and remove the excess dye. Then, leave the flower to dry on the newspaper for 2-3 hours.  Work through all your flowers, dying them using the aforementioned methods. After they have dried for about 3 hours, remove any painters tape you might have applied.	Gather your supplies. Prepare your flowers. Make your acrylic dye. Dye your flowers. Repeat the process.
If you are unsure if you're eligible, go ahead and apply anyway -- you can ask specific questions later if the show contacts you about being a contestant.   If you have appeared on any version of Wheel of Fortune in the past, you are not eligible to reappear. Also, if you have appeared on a game/dating/relationship or reality show in the last year or three of these shows in the last decade, you also are ineligible. In addition, you will be turned down if you work for or are related to anyone who works for Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., the game show prize suppliers, or any TV station that broadcasts the show.; , Visit the Wheel of Fortune site. In the blue navigation bar located under the header photo, hover over "CONTESTANTS." A pink drop-down menu will appear with several options. Click on "Be A Contestant."   The first question will appear, asking you about your age group. Click on either "Adult," "College Student," or "Teen." Fill out the registration form completely and accurately.  As an alternative to the form, Wheel of Fortune has started a "Face of the Fan" contest where prospective applicants send in a 60-second video to score an audition. This way, any person in any city can have a chance.   Visit their website for more information. Because a million people audition each year and only 600 or so are chosen, it is strongly encouraged that if you don't have video equipment to stick to sending in the application form.  It's 39 feet (11.9 m) long, 13 feet (4.0 m) high and bright yellow. It rolls through cities, down highways and into America's heartland. Thousands of fans fill out applications and gather in front of the stage with a traveling version of the famous Wheel and Puzzle board. Applications are drawn at random throughout the event, calling individuals on stage in groups of five to participate in a brief interview, play a version of the Wheel of Fortune speed-up round and win special show-themed prizes.The most promising candidates are invited back to participate in final auditions for the show, usually held at a later date in the Wheelmobile host city. If you want to be notified when the Wheelmobile comes to your area, you can fill out a form online to be notified. However, they do say that they may not be able to contact everyone., They're looking for players who clearly can have fun, are calm in front of the camera, and are good winners and losers. They want you to be decisive and logical in calling out letters and in strategy.   Energetic contestants with a sense of humor generally do the best. Of course, keeping a positive attitude is helpful, too. It's about having a good time, whether you win or lose., The auditions are often held in hotel ballrooms. The contestant coordinators bring about 70 wannabe contestants together and create a sort of mini version of "Wheel of Fortune," complete with puzzles and a miniature wheel. All the participants take turns standing, calling out letters, and solving puzzles.   Then they take a 5 minute written test, consisting of 16 puzzles (where you have to fill in the missing letters). Afterward, they grade the tests and hand outdoor prizes. Then the coordinators tell some of the people to go home, while other people are allowed to stay and play more mock "Wheel" games (as the coordinators size them up). It all takes about two hours. Unfortunately, even if you do make it past the first round, you still won't know the verdict when you finally do head home. You'll have to wait indefinitely to be contacted -- if you've been selected, that is. Whether you're chosen or not depends both on your test scores and on their impression of what kind of contestant you'd make.	Read the eligibility rules. Apply online. Submit a video. Find the Wheelmobile. Have the persona. Rock the audition.
Going out of business sales are often good opportunities to find inexpensive furniture.   Check online or call furniture stores in nearby communities to ask about scheduled sales.; , Damaged furniture will likely be discounted.  You can buy many types of furniture, including solid wood dining sets, bedroom furniture, coffee tables and end tables, desks, bookcases and television and stereo cabinets.  Some stores and websites specialize in selling unfinished furniture.  You may say you saw similar furniture priced lower at another store, and you would be willing to pay the other store's price.  Shopping online has disadvantages because you can't test and handle the furniture, but prices may be much lower. Be sure to include shipping costs when deciding whether to buy online. Get the best prices by comparing online websites(Wayfair, FabFurnish, Ikea, urbanladder, etc)	Watch Sunday newspaper ads, television ads and online websites for sales at local furniture stores. Shop at retail furniture stores for new items that are scratched or dented. Purchase from all-wood furniture specialty stores to avoid furniture made from cheap pressed wood or particle board, which may be sold at high prices even at premier department stores. Buy unfinished furniture from stores or online and stain or paint it yourself to save money. Negotiate prices with sales staff, as some retail stores will lower prices for customers who negotiate. Shop online for discounted furniture.
The ability to hear, recognize, and then match a pitch with your voice is a fundamental ear training skill. While some people have a natural ear, others are “tone deaf.” If you are “tone deaf,” you develop this skill through consistent practice.   Find a digital tuner, piano, or acoustic guitar. Digital tuners are ideal for this exercise because the tool tells you if you are too sharp or too flat. If you don’t have access to any of these tools or instruments, there are several vocal match websites and apps available for you to choose from.; , A target note is the musical note that you wish to match in pitch. You can choose any note within your vocal range—you could start by trying to match pitch with the lowest "C" in your vocal range. As you move through the exercise, continue to pick random notes that fall within your vocal range and attempt to match their pitch.   Play the target note on the digital tuner, piano, or guitar. Listen to the pitch carefully. Try to hear the note in your head. This ability to hear, or visualize, a note in your head is called auralizing. This skill is developed over time and through persistent practice. Sing the target note. If you are using a digital tuner, look at the screen to see if you have perfectly matched the pitch, if you are flat, or if you are sharp. If you are off key, slide your pitch up or down until you perfectly match the pitch. Once you have matched pitch, select a new target note and repeat the process. It may take you awhile to find notes that are within your vocal range and you are comfortable singing. Don’t be afraid to experiment with notes in different octaves., Scales are musical exercises that go up and down in a predetermined pattern. Major scales are the most predictable and familiar. Scales are extremely adaptable and personalized exercises. When you sing scales, you can focus on mastering a specific technique, such as vibrato, overcoming a certain problem, like pitchiness, or increasing your vocal range.   Play a major scale on a piano or acoustic guitar. The C Major scale is an excellent place to start. The C Major scale follows this pattern: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, C, B, A, G, F, E, D, C. Listen to each pitch and visualize the note in your head. Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the scale, focus on matching and maintaining each pitch. After mastering one major scale, move on to another major scale. Repeat the process., Arpeggios, like scales, are musical exercises. Instead of moving up and down from pitch to pitch, arpeggios go up and down in intervals. Practicing arpeggios will not only improve your pitch, but they will also enhance your ability to jump from one pitch to another pitch as you sing.   Play a major arpeggio on a piano or acoustic guitar. Basic arpeggios follow this pattern: 1, 3 (Major Third), 5 (Perfect Fifth), 8, 5 (Perfect Fifth) , 3 (Major Third), 1. Start with the C Major arpeggio. It follows this pattern: C (1), E (3, Major Third), G (5, Perfect Fifth), C (8), G (5, Perfect Fifth), E (3, Major Third), C (1). Listen to each pitch and interval. As you hear the notes, visualize the pitches and intervals in your head. Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the arpeggio, strive to match and maintain each pitch. Pay particular attention to hitting each interval. After mastering the C Major Arpeggio, work on another Major Arpeggio. Repeat the process.	Match pitches on a digital tuner, piano, or guitar. Select a target note. Sing major scales. Sing major arpeggios.
Now you will want to create the tube. This tube comprises the main section of the headband. It will go around the head and embellishments will be added to it. Make it as even as possible but since it is made of stretch fabric, most imperfections will be hidden naturally.          Fold the rectangle of fabric. If you’ve chosen to use stretch lace, this will be unnecessary. If using other materials, fold it lengthwise so that the wrong side is facing outwards. Pin the material using straight pins, so that the long edges are in line with each other. Straight pins should be placed perpendicular to the long side of the fabric. This will keep your sewing machine from catching on a pin if you forget to remove one. It will also make it possible to sew right over the pins as well. Sew the length of the material, leaving your quarter to half-inch seam allowance and the ends open. Use a stitch and sewing machine needle appropriate to the material you have chosen. Stretchy fabrics will require a ball-point needle and a stretch or zigzag stitch. For plain cotton a normal needle and straight stitch should suffice. The same methods can be done by hand but will be more time consuming. Reverse the fabric. This can be done simply by hand but it may be easier to use basic tools. The most common method is to use a small safety-pin. Pin it at the end of the tub in such a way that the dead of the pin is inside the tube. Begin pulling small sections of fabric over the pin and pushing the head down the length of the tube. This takes time but is fair simple. When you are done you may wish to iron the tube flat, to create more of a band appearance. You may also wish to forgo ironing, in favor of a looser, draped look.  The elastic will allow the headband to gently stay on your baby’s head, without constricting or requiring snaps or ties. It will also allow the band to grow with your baby, allowing her to wear it for longer. Be sure that you have enough elastic, as a too-tight band is not good for your baby.          Feed the elastic through the tube. This will be easiest if you place a safety-pin at one end of the elastic and use that to guide you. Make sure that as you pull the elastic through the tube, the elastic remains flat. Sew the two ends of the elastic together by hand or by machine. A zigzag or x-shaped stitch is good for this. Be sure that the elastic is flat and did not twist inside the tube. Close the tube. While it is possible to use your machine, this step works best when using hand stitching. Tuck the ends of the fabric inward as much as possible. Use careful, small whip stitches to join the ends of the tube together. If you do not want to sew by hand, close the tube with your machine, overlapping the fabric and sewing a line down the back. This method will be more visible that hand-stitching. With the tube closed, now your band is done!	Create the tube. Add the elastic.
Chain drives are some of the most popular and durable openers on the market. These drives use a metal chain on a sprocket to lift and lower doors.Chain openers also tend to be some of the most affordable options; however, the affordability and strength of a chain drive come at the expense of noise.Chain drives are ideal for the heaviest garage door types, including oversized doors, one-piece wood doors, and wind-rated or heavily insulated doors. If you have a detached garage or a garage that is at the opposite end of the house from the bedrooms, then the noise will be less of an issue.Many upgraded chain-drive models can come with chain separators to help stop the chain from hitting against the track, which cuts down on the noise of a chain drive.; , Screw drives use a long metal rod threaded like a screw to lift and close garage doors.Due to having relatively few moving parts, a screw drive tends to be quite reliable as well.If noise is your biggest consideration, screw-drive openers tend to be middle of the pack. They’re not nearly as quiet as belt or direct drives, but they are most typically quieter than chain drives.Screw drives also require a bit more maintenance than most of the other types. Despite having fewer moving parts, the threaded metal rod meshes against a drive section with plastic teeth to catch the threading. Without the proper lubrication on this drive, the rod can wear on the teeth and eventually strip them, so you must grease the works fairly regularly—approximately every few months.The type of garage door you have should also be taken into consideration. For heavy wood one-piece doors, the extra weight and strain can wear the teeth in the inner works of the drive down pretty quickly. This makes screw drives most effective with single-car garage doors or steel doors since the thinner materials cut down on weight.Screw-drive openers also offer some of the faster speeds available. Newer models can open at 10” to 12” per second as opposed to the more standard 6” to 8” per second of most other drive types., Belt-drive openers use a rubber or rubber-like belt on a cog to open and close doors.Since the opener doesn’t have the loud, banging metal parts, it’s one of the quietest options available.Consider your particular garage door. If your door makes a lot of noise on its track, then the lower volume of the belt opener may be moot.Pay special attention to the current of belt-drive openers. Alternating current belt openers start and stop at full power, which can cause the door to jerk into movement and lead to noise despite the relative quiet of the drive.Direct current belt drives offer soft starts and stops that reduce noise even further, as well as reducing wear and tear., Though less common than the other models, these alternatives are gaining in popularity, and both offer additional options for quiet door openers.   Jackshaft openers attach directly to the front wall of the garage, meaning no overhead parts.These models use cables attached directly to the garage door along with pulleys and a rolling torsion bar to lift and lower the door.Many models of this computerized system even include an automatic deadbolt that locks when the door closes for added safety.Due to the compact nature and computerization, jackshaft openers are some of the most expensive models available, and the cable system also means that they only work on sectioned garage doors.Direct-drive openers still have an overhead rail with a chain, but the actual motor moves along the track with the door connected to the motor via a J-arm.Since the motor moves instead of the chain, these models are also extremely quiet, and since the only real moving part is the motor, they tend to come with extremely good—maybe even lifetime—warranties. They are still on the pricey side, however—comparable to a belt drive opener., 1/2-HP is the standard for most garage doors, and it is also the most popular motor speed. Depending on the type of drive you pair it with, the 1/2-HP motor can lift most garage door types. However, while it can lift most door types, well-insulated garage doors and one-piece, wooden doors can put extra strain on 1/2-HP motors that might lead to more wear and tear than with something more powerful.  3/4-HP motors are the next step up from 1/2-HP models. The additional power makes these motors a more durable, longer-lasting option, but the increased durability comes with a higher price tag as well. The extra power doesn’t just increase the life of these motors, but it also means they’re capable of lifting heavier doors more easily without as much wear.   Door styles that might benefit from the additional power include one-piece wooden doors on two-car garages or specialty doors with heavy insulation and wind-load ratings.  1-HP motors offer the maximum in efficiency and power. These motors are perfect for the heaviest garage doors, including oversized doors and commercial or industrial doors. When it comes to a standard, sectioned garage door, the extra power may prove unnecessary for your needs, especially at the larger price.  In addition to the horsepower of a motor, you should also consider the current. Direct current motors are most common on belt drives, but more manufacturers are incorporating them into other drive types as well. Direct current motors are typically more expensive, but they offer the added benefit of soft starts and stops, which means that the drive begins a gradual lift and stop on the door, and this equates to much less noise than a motor that jerks to life and shakes the door.Direct current motors are also more likely to provide backup battery options, allowing you to get several uses out of your garage door even during a power outage.	Consider chain-drive openers as a cost-effective option. Consider screw-drive openers for a well-rounded option. Consider belt-drive openers for quiet operation. Consider direct-drive and jackshaft openers for quiet and highly dependable options. Consider 1/2-HP models for standard doors. Consider 3/4-HP models for insulated or one-piece, wooden doors. Consider 1-HP models for oversized or industrial doors. Consider AC versus DC motors.
Choose strong fabric, such as upholstery fabric, from the sample range. You can often get samples, off-cuts or even the whole sample book simply by asking nicely at a store you know stocks such fabrics. When the season or line is no longer fashionable, the sample books are often donated.; , Each strip needs to be at least 10cm/4 inches in length and 2.5cm/1 inch in width. For the best design, use a different fabric for each strip but coordinated. For example, keep flowers with flowers, stripes with stripes, etc.  Gather it by sewing through the middle several times and knotting off tightly. Repeat for each of the other strips. They will look like little bows.  To do this, align the middle pieces in a clock formation, fanning around. Then sew all of the center pieces together.   Use a strong needle that is suited for upholstery fabrics and a thimble or thumb protector to give you the necessary oomph to push the needle through. Sew slowly, as this can be hard going. For certainty of hold, do at least six stitches, up to ten at most.  This not only covers up the stitching but serves as the center of the floral brooch. Choose a pretty button!  , Sew the pink/brooch back in place. Check that it is firmly attached.   You could also glue it in place. If so, follow the package instructions.  The fabric flower brooch is now ready for wearing. Why not make a few more for friends and family?	Select the fabric. Cut the fabric into strips using pinking shears. Pinch the middle of one strip in. Connect all of the pieces together. Sew a button in the middle area. Turn the brooch over. Done.

Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work one chain stitch from the loop., Work 12 single crochets into the center of the chain you just created.  Join the last single crochet to the top of the first using a slip stitch. Completing this step should form a tight circle that will act as the foundation round.  Chain one. Double crochet once into the stitch at the base of chain and the stitch that follows, completing one decrease.  Chain three. Double crochet once into the next two stitches, completing another decrease. Chain three.  Repeat this pattern across the remaining stitches in the round.   Join the last chain to the top of the first completed double crochet using a slip stitch.  Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first stitch of this chain. Slip stitch once more into the first chain-three space.  Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first chain. Slip stitch once into the next double crochet. Chain three, slip stitch once into the first of those chains, then slip stitch once into the next chain-three space. Chain three and slip stitch once into the first of these chains.  Repeat this pattern around the rest of the round.   Join the last stitch of this round with the first using one slip stitch.  Work a chain long enough to wrap around your finger. Connect the last stitch of this chain to the opposite side of the picot decoration using a slip stitch.  The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your finger, so you'll need to check the length against your finger before completing the band. When joining the band to the decoration, slip stitch into the slip-stitch space in between picots on the opposite side of the ring.  Cut the yarn, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of excess. Pull this excess yarn through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.  Using a tapestry needle, weave the excess ends into the stitches. This step completes the project; your ring should be ready to wear.	Chain one. Single crochet into the center. Decrease double crochet across the round. Slip stitch across the round. Chain around your finger. Fasten off the yarn.
Check to see if there is a webpage for foreign travelers about driving in the country you’re visiting. Many countries in Europe, for instance, will have information available online about specific driving rules and regulations. Since these webpages are designed for foreign visitors, they will often be available in multiple languages.   You own country’s embassy websites can also helpful. Visit the website for your country’s embassy that is located in the country you’re looking for information on. If information is not forthright, there will likely be contact information on the website.  Your own government’s recommendations about driving abroad can also be helpful. In particular, these websites will contain information about driving practices that you are used to, but that are uncommon in other parts of the world.   This will be especially helpful when visiting a neighboring country. When travel between the two countries is common, you will be able to find plenty of information on government webpages.  While you already know you should never drink and drive, it’s important to recognize that the legal blood alcohol content to operate a motor vehicle in many countries is very low. In some countries, such as Japan and Czech Republic, you can get into serious legal trouble for driving with any alcohol in your system at all.Your country’s embassy in your destination country is the best source of information on unique driving rules and regulations. Other countries, such as Italy and France, will fine you for not wearing a seat belt on the spot. Prevent this by always wearing your seat belt. Finally, some European cities have outlawed using your horn unless it is an emergency. While horn use is both popular and common in some countries, it is heavily frowned upon in others.	Visit the destination country’s government website. Check your own country’s recommendations. Be aware of strict laws in some places.
Check to see if the caulk has pulled away from the tub or wall, or if it has formed cracks that may allow water to seep through to the wall.; ,   Silicone caulk is soft and rubbery and often comes off in 1 strip. Latex caulk is harder and often more difficult to remove. You can locate a caulk-softening agent from a hardware store to help in the caulk-removal process. Use the agent and the least abrasive tool that you can use to remove the old caulk.    Latex is easiest to work with and clean up, but silicone is more durable. Caulk may come in a squeeze tube, but for others you may need a caulk gun.  Use a utility knife and a piece of wire or long nail to break the seal at the bottom of the nose piece.   Do not try to squeeze the caulk without piercing the seal because the tube may burst.  Make sure that the caulk is being pressed into the joint and not just sitting on the outside of it.  You may also purchase a caulking tool to shape and smooth the caulk. ,	Inspect the caulk around the wall joint of your tub or shower. Use a putty knife to remove the defective caulk from the tab or wall joint. Purchase either silicone or latex caulk to replace the caulking seals around the tub or shower. Cut off the tip of the caulk tube at a 45-degree angle. Place a bead of caulk along the joint. Use a wet finger to smooth the caulk. Remove excess caulk with a rag or a caulking tool.  , Allow the caulk to cure as directed by the manufacturer.
You can find this in the owner's manual, on a sticker inside the driver-side door jamb, or in the glove compartment.   It may be the same for all four tires, or the front and rear tires may be different—it differs by model. Normally, it will be in the range of 28 to 36 psi (pounds per square inch) or 195 to 250 kPa (kilopascals). You can also find the maximum tire pressure on the tires themselves, but use this only if you can't find the vehicle's recommended numbers. "Maximum" doesn't necessarily translate to "best." A good rule of thumb is to set the tires to 32 psi. Then find the proper pressure and correct as needed.; , Warm air expands, and will give you a false reading of greater pressure.  This is the little black or silver stem poking out from your wheel. Remove the cap, and put it where you won't lose it.          There are two kinds of valve stems: rubber valve stems and metal valve stems that are on wheels equipped with TPMS (tire pressure monitoring systems).  Place the plug end of the gauge squarely onto the valve stem, and press down firmly. It may hear the hissing of air escaping; if so, press harder until the hissing stops. Read the gauge as directed to determine the pressure.          If the tire pressure matches the recommended number, replace the cap and move to the next tire. Repeat this process for all four tires, plus the spare. Should you run flat, it's not going to be helpful to have a flat spare!	Find the recommended pressure. Check the tires when cool. Remove the screw-on cap from the valve. Attach the gauge.
The natural green copper patina can be mimicked with an ammonia solution, while the slightly darker color of an American penny can be created with baking soda and water. Because the application of these solutions are so similar, they are both described in this section.  Wipe the item clean with a dry cloth. Grimy copper items should be washed in warm, soapy water instead, then dried thoroughly.  If you are trying to create a green patina, you'll need to use ammonia. Work outside or in an area with a powerful ventilation system or fan. Ammonia fumes can be toxic, so ammonia should never be handled in an enclosed space. Rubber gloves and safety glasses are recommended.   If creating a brown patina with baking soda and water, no safety precautions are required.  Stir together 2 cups (or 500 mL) white vinegar, 0.5 cups (or 125 mL) non-iodized salt, and 1.5 cups (or 375 mL) clear ammonia.Ammonia can be found at some grocery stores and drug stores, but take care not to purchase the weaker "detergent" variety.   The more salt you add, the greener the patina will be.  This solution will turn your copper a darker brown, roughly the color of an American penny. Simply shake baking soda in a bottle of hot water one spoonful at a time, until additional baking soda does not dissolve., Use a spray bottle to apply the patina onto the surface of the copper. Spray more heavily if you want a more even result rather than streaks or patterns.  This patina may take a few hours to develop, but keeping it in moist air will speed this process up. If the copper is kept in a dry environment, use a plastic bag or plastic sheeting to cover the copper without touching its surface. This will help retain moisture.  Depending on the environment the copper is kept in, and how often it is handled, the patina may wear off or fade before it sets permanently. If this occurs, reapply as before, either to the entire surface or to the area wear the patina has rubbed off.   The green patina tends to be more powdery and easier to rub off than the brown one.	Mix your own solutions to achieve specific colors. Clean your copper. Follow safety procedures if working with ammonia. Use ammonia for a green patina solution. Mix a brown patina solution instead. Spray the copper with the solution. Keep in a humid area for one to eight hours. Reapply the solution if the patina fades.
An eBook reader is a device for browsing electronic files representing books. An eBook reader typically has a low-resolution but low-glare black-and-white screen, often not backlit, the size of a paperback book page. Compared to a general-purpose computer or smartphone which is often backlit, an eBook reader will be thin and light and have a long battery life. eBook readers typically read one or more of several proprietary "eBook" file formats. Some eBook readers are also capable of reading documents in other forms, such as open-standard "ePub" eBooks, plain text files, PDFs, Word documents, and so forth, and some will also allow you to take notes, sync with other devices, etc. eBook readers don't have the "feel" of books, which some enjoy. But they have a few advantages such as being lightweight and portable, and being able to hold a lot more than a single paperback ever could. This makes them ideal for taking away on vacation, for reading in a favorite outdoor nook, or for reading on-the-go.   A dedicated eBook reader may be the most convenient way to read eBook files, but it is not the only way. PC and smartphone software is available free of charge to read ePub and various proprietary eBook formats such as those for Nookand Kindle. It would be good for infrequent use, for back lighting, for a big screen which props itself up (on a computer, perfect for complicated material that requires glancing forward and back repeatedly), or for sampling the eBook concept before buying a reader device. An eBook reader can make a great gift for someone who is both a technology enthusiast and a reader of long books. Because there are many specialized kinds, make sure the recipient can easily return it if it turns out not to suit his or her needs. Not all eBook readers can handle the same formats. In addition to certain seller-specific proprietary formats, many readers support HTML, plain text, and JPG but not all support the open standard ePub.This is an important distinction if you want to check out ebooks from your library, or to read the vast library of copyright-free (in the United States at least) ebooks at Project Gutenberg with nicer formatting than plain text files can provide.Be aware that some eBook readers handle PDFs better than others; this is important if you intend to use PDFs a lot.Some of the most common dedicated eBook readers include Barnes and Noble Nook, Kobo eReader, Amazon Kindle, Sony eReader, etc., with each electronic reader having its own features, feel, and capacity. Non-dedicated eBook readers (that is, items that are used for other purposes as well) include your computer, smartphone (with relevant apps installed), and the iPad.; , There are numerous things that you need to consider when choosing an eBook reader. One important thing to keep in mind is that choosing an eBook reader is fairly much like choosing many other electronic gadgets and even cars in on key respect – it all depends on what you want to do with it, and there is no one right eBook reader for every person, and different features can make all the difference to your choice.Since the features count for everything, the following features are currently the ones to pay attention to:    Memory: How many eBooks or other documents does the eBook reader have the capacity for? Can this memory capacity be increased?  Format type: Can the eBook reader handle a variety of file types or only one type (see previous step)? Is this ability (or lack of it) reflected in the price?  Connectivity: Does the eBook reader have 3G and WiFi connectivity? Most of the recent ones should by now.  Screen friendliness: Here you need to be concerned about viewability, color, size, and reflectiveness (glare).   Viewability: Is it easy to read? Which eBook readers seem most like the pages of a book? Some have more of this feel than others.  Color: Black and white or color? Both have advantages and drawbacks. Black and white is easy on the eye for novels and sun reading (see "Viewability" below), while books and other items such as magazines or comics which need color to transfer their beauty and photos (such as art books, cookbooks, graphic novels, etc.), won't appear so well on plain black and white eBook readers and should be experienced in color.  Size: Compare the eBook reader screen with the screen of non-dedicated eBook readers such as an iPad or your laptop to see which you prefer, and if you're happy to downsize your screen reading experience.  Reflectiveness: One of the advantages of black and white eBook readers (using E-ink technology) is that they can be read in full sun without reflecting, glaring, or loss of image, unlike a laptop, color eBook, or an iPad. If you're planning on reading outdoors a lot, keep this consideration at the forefront.    Weight and comfort: Each person's impression of weight and feel is rightly different but there are some things to assess:  Does it weigh less than your usual paperback? It should. Is it easy to carry and hold? You don't want something that's bulky, awkward, or hard to hold. In particular, be sure to hold the eBook reader in the store to check its weight and to ascertain whether the weight is comfortable for you personally. You might spend hundreds of hours with your electronic book reader, and it is important that relationship on a physical level is comfortable. For example, one eBook reader might have buttons and screen that are easy to use for paging through content, but after five minutes you notice some eye strain. That product wouldn’t work for you because you are going to need to be able to look at it for long periods without eye strain or headaches.    Battery life: What's the battery life promised by the blurb? You don't want an eBook reader that runs out after an hour of sitting on your hammock at the beach. You could have taken a paper novel along in that case! Can the battery be replaced by you or do you need to send the eReader to a technician for replacement?  Ease of downloading: Is it easy to download eBooks? Do you have to connect to the computer or can it be done without a computer as the intermediary? This can be important when choosing an eBook reader as a gift for an older person who isn't that keen on "fiddling" with technology.Share ability: The ability to transfer eBooks to another eBook reader is important, especially if you need to remove purchased books from an old eBook reader to a new one; if you can't do this, you may lose the purchase when the eBook reader dies. Does the eBook reader allow sharing with friends or not?  Other features: What other features does the eBook reader have? For example, does it allow you to add notes? How easy is the process? Some readers have keyboards that work well. Others are difficult to use and can distract you from your reading. How easy is it to "page back" and find something? Are there dictionaries and is it possible to upload new ones?  , Although this is a time-consuming activity, it's the most important part of choosing an expensive product, especially one liable to fast changes and updates. You want to be sure that you're getting the best value product for its kind at the time, as well as knowing that it will do absolutely everything you want it to do. The best research will be a combination of reading both professional reviews and user-submitted content because this provides a balance of viewpoints. Where technology reviewers might be paid to focus on about certain features, the consumer points of view should help to inject some realism into the worth or otherwise of the eBook reader.   Ask others about their eBook experiences. Friends and family members may have insights about what is important to know before buying one. For example, some readers only allow you to read down loadable books, but others provide Internet access so you can also read blogs and websites. Asking people who already have used eBook devices is faster than researching the information and most people are generally interested in ensuring you don't encounter the same pitfalls that they did!  , While it may be tempting to purchase an eBook reader from overseas, double and triple check the compatibility for your home area. The problem may be that you cannot download books for it because you live in a different region from where you purchased the eBook reader and that would leave you with a less-than-bargain priced eBook reader! Moreover, check the method by which your eBook reader allows downloads. Some provide WiFi download compatibility and USB download, others only have USB download. What will be most convenient for you?   Look into the breadth of options for getting eBooks that comes with your eBook reader. Some eBook readers enable free reading with a bookstore and loan of items.If that appeals to you, realize that the extent of free reads and loans might be highly dependent on the particular bookstore. Check your local library's provision of eBooks. Many libraries are now adding eBooks to their lending systems. Talk to your local librarian about eBook reader compatibility issues, especially if you intend on relying a great deal on your library.  Some eBook readers are able to access more content than others, and the ideal is to get an eBook reader that has the largest content availability possible, to ensure that you can access eBooks that are relevant to your interests. However, the extent of access is changing rapidly and is becoming less of an issue. What is important is to check that the eBook reader that interests you can access the content that interests you. Ask the retailer for more information if your research hasn't made this clear.  Once you've done the research, make a list of the features you want (see the suggested things to consider above) and take this list along to the store. You may need to visit a variety of stores to cover each eBook reader you're keen to trial. Take a bit of time to play with the eBook readers and to ask the assistants questions about them. It's important to do this manual checking because it gives you the opportunity to hold the item, page through the content, see how the screen appears to you, and to simply get a feel for each type of reader in your own hands.   Try to read at least one chapter of a book to see how the reading feels on each reader. As you're doing so, think about the ease of seeing the text, the ease of turning pages, the ease of finding the information, etc.  It's a good idea to go home after your trialing expedition and to think through the purchase. You've done the research and the testing, now allow a few days for the right one to surface in your thinking. Don't be swayed by boredom, loneliness, stress, or the urgency of trends; these gadgets are new and therefore subject to a lot of change and if you're going to fork out a lot of money for one, it needs to be the right one for now.   While some eBook readers might have more bells and whistles than others, if you just want the basics at this stage, a cheaper, less fancy version could be a good initial solution, allowing you to upgrade to a fancier eBook reader as new versions are released down the track. Note that in the short time since eBooks have been released, the prices have been dropping dramatically, so waiting does no harm. Consider purchasing a reconditioned or used eBook reader. Older models are often just as functional as those which replaced them and can be found for much lower prices. Be sure to check the warranty information. New products can bring unknown problems with them and it's reassuring to know you can return it without hassle if something goes wrong, as well as finding out what happens if you lose any eBooks due to technical malfunctions.	Know what eBook readers are. Know what to look for in an eBook reader. Read online product reviews. Be careful about the ability to find eBooks and download them to your eBook reader. Check the eBook provider's breadth of published content access. Visit the store to try the eBook reader. Don’t rush your decision.
If there's potential to rock out, think like a Boy Scout. You may not be able to rock out as hard in flannel and suspenders ("braces" for you British folks with your eyebrows all a-flutter). Think ahead. How much rocking are you capable of?   Jeans and a t-shirt is always classic for either sex. Is this a party where you can gallivant discalced? Or will you be keeping your shoes on? Consider this when choosing your footwear. Ladies, get ready to move. The last thing you want is to interrupt your metal horns to adjust your hemline. Wear something comfortable.  If they're not already being cranked. But let's face it, you shouldn't be the one to have to get the party started. What kind of party are you even at? Your own? Ah, alright. Proceed.   Find music that gets everybody going. In this circumstance, rocking out is a community bonding session. You'll feed off their energy and they will feed off yours. As a result, a beautiful thing will become nascent. Take time to feel the vibes and let it brew. Don't crank the jams too loudly. The police hate that.  Sting loves it, however.  By this time, the party-goers should be in a distinctive yet morphing shape. Get in there! Show them your stuff.   Use your body. Don't be afraid to get on your knees or pop a handstand (you've been practicing after all, right?). Just make sure the area is clear before you risk popping someone's eye out. Then the fun and games just stop. Jump up and down. And then up and down again. And possibly a few times after that. If no one else is jumping, start it. They'll wonder why they aren't jumping with you. And hey, calf workout!  , Rocking out can be a great release and is sometimes necessary, but it also can be incredibly dangerous or, at worst, fatal. Drinking and driving, smoking, and other illicit drugs get all the hype--think of rocking out like the Korean War (when was that again?). Just because it doesn't receive the appropriate anti-marketing campaign doesn't mean you should rock out carelessly.   Watch your elbows. Those things can be weapons of destruction if flailed about angrily. Stay sober. Drunken rocking out is a recipe for disaster and a recipe for a trip to the temple of the porcelain gods. Besides, you'll want to remember this cathartic experience when it's over. Don't judge other rockers. They may not have the skills you do and that's fine. They may be rocking out to One Direction...also...fine...mostly. Either way, these people are made up of the same stuff you are: stuff that's looking to rock out. Embrace them.	Prepare the look. Crank the jams. Get moving. Be responsible.
They can happen very quickly and suddenly, so be very attentive. If the bright light hurts your eyes, look through a translucent curtain to dull the impact of the light, or focus your eyes away from the window so the lightning flashes in your peripheral vision.   Note that faraway lightning will be much more difficult to spot, so keep a steady watch. If you sense the storm is not close to you (e.g. faint thunder) watch more carefully for lightning bolts.; , Start a stopwatch, count in your head, or use the stopwatch on your phone. Do not stop.  Listen carefully- distant thunder may be difficult to hear. If you have been counting for a very long time, chances are you missed the thunder. Search for another bolt of lightning and start the process over.  (For example: 10 divided by 5.) If the dividend cannot be wholly divided by five, you can either round the quotient or divide to a decimal (you may need a calculator).   Before proceeding, make sure you didn't accidentally make a minor mistake or miscalculation. If you want to find out the distance of lightning in kilometers, divide by three. (e.g. 9 divided by 3). You are likely to come across a decimal, so choose if you want an exact measurement or a rough estimate.  (For example, 10 divided by 5 equals 2, so lightning is two miles away, or 9 divided by 3 equals 3, so lightning is 3 kilometers away.) You can do this as many times as you like, but try to space your countings a minute or two apart, otherwise you will likely end up with roughly the same result.  With time, the miles away of the lightning should either get smaller or larger, depending on whether the storm is moving closer or farther away from you. If you get roughly the same number for a extensive period, check your work to make sure you didn't have any miscalculations.	Look outside for a flash of lightning. Once you see the lightning, begin counting right away. Stop counting once you hear a roll of thunder. Divide the number of seconds you counted between the lightning and thunder by five.  Once you have found your quotient, that is how many miles or kilometers away lightning is.
Not all stars are, but some are, and can be very useful.  Eclipsing binaries, like Algol in Perseus, are two stars orbiting each other.  Compare these to the characteristics of known variable types to determine the type of variable star. For example, Cepheid variables have periods of days to months and amplitudes of up to 2 magnitudes, whereas Delta Scuti  variables have periods of less than 8 hours, and amplitudes of less than 0.9 magnitudes.	Determine if the star is variable. Determine if it is an eclipsing binary. Determine the amplitude and period of the variation.
Block the rear wheels with something heavy (like bricks or lumber which is small enough to jam under the wheels) to prevent the car from rolling or sliding while it's jacked up. Apply the emergency or parking brake to hold the rear wheels fast. (The vehicle's "PARK" gear will only hold one of the drive wheels, if you have a front-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your front wheels and if you have a rear-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your back wheels).  If you skip this step, loosening the lugs may be very annoying, if not impossible. It is also somewhat dangerous to loosen lug nuts after a car has been jacked up.  Caution: a floor jack's wheels need to be able to roll and the jack needs to travel a little and so it must not embed (sink) into a soft floor or surface.   Never work without jackstands that are on solid flat surface like stepping-stones or wide scraps of strong wood to keep the jackstands from sinking, leaning or tilting and falling, etc. Position the jackstands under a solid part of the car — the frame or subframe. You can easily damage the underside of the car, or even break something.       Give the car a couple of good hard, small shoves from side to side; if it's going to shift, slide off the jackstands, sink into asphalt, dirt or gravel, or just twist around and fall, better to learn now while the wheels are on than when you're partially under it with the wheels off.  In case the car slips off the stands, those wheels may prevent you, your arms or head from being caught under a falling car (preventing the car from falling to the ground) if the jack stands fall over.	Park the car in a clean, solid, well-lit place. Loosen the lug nuts before jacking the car up (do not remove lug nuts yet). Jack the car up with a sturdy jack on a solid surface (such as a floor jack if you have concrete to work on) and lower it very slowly and carefully onto jackstands. Finish removing the wheels, and lay the wheels under the car, just to the rear of the jackstands.
Allow the part to dry. Drying can occur using a hair-dryer or in air. If air-dried, allow enough time for the cleaning agent to evaporate from the defects. This may take several hours depending on the ambient temperature and cleaning material used on the part.; , This can be accomplished by spraying, brushing, dipping, etc. Allow the penetrant material to sit for a minimum of 10 minutes. Do not let the penetrant sit on the surface for longer than 2 hours as drying may occur. The part and penetrant should beat a temperature between 50 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  Remove as much penetrant as possible using as many cloths as necessary. This is followed by wetting a lint free cloth with a solvent. The cloth must be damp or moist. A cloth dripping with solvent will wash the penetrant material out of the defect and make the test ineffective. Allow the solvent to dry before the next step.  The developer usually come in a spray can and is normally white. Apply a light coating holding the can about 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) from the surface. You should see visual evidence of the metal surface showing after applying the developer. Too thick of a coat will make the test ineffective.  Bright white light for visible dye penetrants and UV light for fluorescent type penetrants. Evaluating the results. This is the most difficult part of the testing process. Most people do not have a lot of experience with the different defect types, for example, porosity, shrink, cracks, etc.Porosity is typically round and easily defined, while shrink can look like a big blob of residual penetrant. Solvent wiping can help in determining the defect type and if the indication you are seeing is from a real defect or just an anomaly not associated with a defect. Solvent wiping is achieved by wiping the area of interest with a cloth dampened with solvent. Do not flood the area with solvent or allow solvent to run or pool on the surface as this may washout the defect and make it undetectable. As soon as the wiping occurs you can look at the indication to determine defect type	Clean the part thoroughly using a suitable cleaner, acetone, aqueous degreasing, etc. Apply the penetrant to the surface being inspected. Remove excess penetrant using a clean, dry, lint free cloth. Apply non-aqueous developer. The evaluation should occur using the proper lighting.
To do tricks, you need to develop the right foot placement to ensure that the scooter will land where you want it to land. Typically, if you are right footed, your left foot will be your riding foot, placed forward on the scooter, and will not leave the scooter unless you're jumping to do a trick. The right foot will be used to push off and move the scooter, and will stand near the brake toward the back of the scooter when you're cruising.   Practice riding your scooter around and do what feels comfortable. Even if you're right footed, the "fakie" placement, with your right foot as the riding foot, might feel more comfortable.; , Before you start kicking the scooter out from under your feet while in motion, practice the basic "kick" while you're standing still on the ground. With your riding foot on the scooter, use your other foot to push the side of the scooter abruptly and firmly so it spins around under you and comes back to its original position.   Practice jumping out of the way of the scooter as you kick it back behind and around your body with your pushing foot. When you can do this regularly, you're ready to start trying a tail whip in motion.  It'll happen quickly, but you can lift the handle bar slightly with your hands to make sure the scooter raises off the ground. Try to keep the scooter as parallel to the ground as possible while you do this.   Practice by picking up the scooter and getting a feel for its weight. As you practice, get a feel for how high you need to lift the scooter (if at all) and how much you'll need adjust the scooter so it stays level. Your hands should never leave the grips for this move.  Place your riding foot on the scooter and start pushing off until you maintain a good speed. Stay balanced without going too quickly. Put your riding foot forward and position your pedaling foot on the opposite side of the brake, slightly hanging over the edge.  This will cross your legs slightly, so the trick is to get them back uncrossed and land the trick at the same moment the scooter makes it's full rotation. When you first get started, practice your timing by landing on the ground and move on when you can do that regularly.  When the scooter comes around towards your riding foot, place your riding foot on it, and pull it the remainder of the 360 degree rotation to land straight, then position your pedaling foot in a comfortable position.   This will take lots of practice. Steady the scooter and stop its rotation with your riding foot before planting the scooter back onto the ground with your pushing foot.  To do a heel whip, or a "opposite" tail whip, you'll do essentially the same move, but kick the scooter in the opposite direction. Push out with your pushing foot, using your heel to push the scooter forward, instead of behind you. Stop the rotation of the scooter with your riding foot and land the trick with your pushing foot like normal.	Choose your riding foot and your pushing foot. Practice the tailwhip while standing. Use your hands to control the height and motion of the scooter during the whip. Practice while in motion. Jump into the air, and push the brake sideways with your pushing foot. Land the tail-whip. Practice doing a heel whip.
This means, stop using the transpose button gradually, until not using it becomes the new normal for you.; , It is helpful to write out these tools using solfa notation, as this will make it easy to transcribe to other keys.  Choose one key per week, then at the end of the week, rehearse everything you have practiced. Note the difference between practice time and rehearsal time. In practice time, you are learning new material, while in rehearsal time, you are revising the material you already learnt.  Also, when practicing, be sure to have your fingers as relaxed as possible, as this would help improve on speed and accuracy, though much focus should be placed on accuracy  , What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  For example, if you are learning Key C on a certain week, move over to Key F or Key G the next week. The reason for this is because keys a perfect fourth interval apart are very much similar, with a difference of only one extra black note. For example, if you're moving from Key C to Key F, there is only one added black note which is A#.  Include all the inversions of the key you're learning.  Practice their inversions of the key.  Examples are the 2-5-1, 7-3-6, 7-3-6-2-5-1, b5-7-3, and 5-1-4.  In about two months, with some level of discipline and consistency, you should be able to break out of the transpose comfort zone.	Break out of your comfort zone. Write out everything you know on your favourite key including chords, scales, chord structures, scale patterns, and licks. Devote at least two hours daily to practice. Practice until you have developed muscle memory (you can play it without much effort). Don't be afraid of mistakes. As you move from one key to another, do this in perfect fourths or fifths. Practice all the triads (major, minor, diminished and augmented). Practice the seventh chords (Maj.7, Min.7, Dim.7, Dom.7, etc). Afterwards, begin to learn standard progressions and their substitutions on each key, one at a time. Begin to incorporate all the licks you already know on your favourite key into all other keys, one by one.

This example shows use of bronze and white papers for the card. You can vary the colours as per your requirement. Take a more than 160 grams per square meter weight paper (250 gsm paper is used in this example), preferably A4 sheet but you can really use any size you want. Fold it into half and decide which side you want to use as the front of the card.; , In this case, guidelines are made 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) from the edge, leaving enough room for the design to be accommodated.  Don't use ordinary cello tape as it's hard to remove. Scotch tape comes off easily.    Here is how it will look.    This is how it'll look after finishing.    Make one or two rectangles with this ribbon depending on your preference. This is how it'll look after you're finished with pasting the ribbons.  You can use a negative embossing pattern also. In that case, you need to paste it on the back side, much like the angel embossing pattern.  This is how it'll look from the back as you emboss.   After you're through with embossing, cut out the portions from in between and if you wish to, make a thin border cut. ,   This is a flower punch. This is how it looks at the base. This shows you how it punches a flower out of a paper.  Using an ordinary paper punch, cut out two small circles of bronze paper and paste them at the centre of the white flower. And that's it. The card is ready!  ,	Choose the colours you want to use. Make guidelines on the back side of the front cover. Stick the embossing pattern with scotch tape along the guiding lines. Take an embossing needle (as you can see in the picture here) and start outlining the pattern on the front cover, much like moving a pen around on a stencil. Outline the inner pattern after you're through with the outer pattern. Keeping the edge of the embossed pattern in mind, cut the bronze (or whichever colour you want) paper ribbon and paste it as shown. Paste the second mold on the “outside” of the front cover (it's a positive embossing pattern). Start embossing with the needle on the reverse side. Paste a bronze colour paper at the back to give it a matched look.  , Use the same bronze colour paper, cut out flowers and paste them as shown. Paste a white flower of a smaller size on top of the bronze flower. Finished.
This part requires good balancing to ensure that they are not cut off too short or left too long.   Use a sharp knife, clippers, or hand shears to perform this.; , Finished basketry work should be carefully singed to remove the thin fibers that tend to stick out after working with the cane. Do this using the tip of a Bunsen burner or small craft flame.   Avoid using a wax taper such as a candle, as this will blacken the cane-work.  This will remove any dirt and improves the look of the basket. Do not use soap.  If it isn't, it will discolor and it may attract mold or mildew growth.	Cut off any excess ends of cane. Singe the work. Wash the piece with warm water. Ensure that the basketry work is fully dry before placing into storage.
If you want to be able to move your clay person around after it's finished, you'll need modeling clay. This clay doesn't dry in the air, so it's perfect for making clay models out of. If you want your clay person to be still once it's done, you can use oven-bake clay.   You can make your clay person all the same color, or you can use different colors for different parts of the body. For example, if you want it to look like your clay person is wearing a shirt, you can use a green or white piece of clay for the torso.; , Pinch off a piece of the clay. Roll the piece of clay into a ball. This will be the clay person's head.   It's up to you what color the clay person's skin will be. You can make the whole person out of blue clay, or you can find some flesh colored clay for the head and arms., Pinch off a piece of clay that's larger than the head. Shape this piece into a fat snake-like cylinder. Flatten the cylinder slightly.  Pinch off two more pieces of clay. Roll these pieces into two long tube shapes. One tube should be thicker than the other. These will become the arms and legs., Take the ball that will be the head and pinch out of it a little spike of clay. This will be how the head will attach to the body.   The neck should jut out of the head like a small spike or cone, and should be about half the length of the neck. And make sure it's thick enough that you can hold the head up by holding nothing but the neck between two fingers.  Take something narrow, like a pencil, or a toothpick, and burrow out a small hole in the top of the body cylinder. Make sure the hole isn't too wide, but wide enough for the neck to fit in. Make the hole deep enough for the neck to go completely in.  Stick the neck into the hole in the body so that the ball touches the body. Smooth out the edge where the head meets the body to make it secure., Find the middle of the smaller tube and tear it into, for the two arms.  With your thumb and finger, flatten a small bit of one end of both arms. These will become the hands.  First, cut out a bit of the flattened parts. Use something sharp to cut out a corner of the flattened ends of the arms. Then round out the corners of the hand so that it looks like a cartoony thumb and fingers.  Take the finished arms and attach them to the sides of the body. Smooth out the connection between the arms and body to secure them.   If the arms are too long, tear off an even amount from both arms until they're as short as you'd like., Find the middle of the larger tube and tear it into, for the two legs.  Bend one end of both of the legs. Shape this bent part into a rough foot shape. Make sure they are large enough to support the legs. Stand the legs up to test the feet. Press the feet into the table so that the feet bottoms are flat.  Stick the legs into the bottom of the body. Smooth the connection between the legs and body to secure them together. Make sure the feet are facing forward.If the clay person can't stay standing on its own at this point, you'll need to redo the legs and make them thicker.  If you're clay person can't stand up on its own after you attach the legs, there could be a balancing issue. You can always make the legs thicker, but sometimes the legs are plenty thick, and it still falls over. In that case, you might want to redo various parts of the person and experiment with a shorter torso, less clay for the torso, smaller arms, a smaller head, ect.   Also make sure the clay person's torso is straight, and that the arms are close to the same size and weight.  Tear off four small bits of clay. Make four balls out of these clay pieces. Two of these balls should be smaller than the others.  Push the smaller balls into the larger ones. Flatten them a bit into the bigger balls. These will be the eyes.  Press both eyes firmly into to the head of your person.If you want, you can use another method to make eyes, such as using two googly eyes, or making eyes out of paper.If you want a simpler method for making eyes, you can just take a pencil and make two round holes in the head for eyes. You can use a pencil to carve out a smile or open mouth as well.  Take a small pinch of clay and roll it into a small tube. The tube should be no longer than the width of the head. You can make it as thin as you'd like the mouth to be.  Place the small tube under the eyes, where the mouth should go. With the flexibility of the tube, you can make any sort of expression you want, a smile, a frown, or any other mouth shape.  You can add a nose to your clay person's face by just taking a small bit of clay and sticking it in the center of the face. Then use your fingers to form it into any sort of nose shape you want, a small ball, a little triangle, whatever shape you prefer.	Get clay. Make a ball for the head. Make a tube for the body. Make two long tubes for the arms and legs. Pinch out the neck. Make a hole for the neck. Attach the head to the body. Tear the arm tube into two pieces. Flatten the ends of the arms. Mold the hands. Attach the arms. Tear the leg tube into two pieces. Make the feet. Attach the legs. Troubleshoot any balancing issues. Make balls for the eyes. Finish the eyes. Attach the eyes. Make a small tube for the mouth. Attach the mouth to the head. Add a nose.
If you have decided that you are not okay with him paying, and you have talked about it, then the first step is to start changing the behavior. The next time you are out, offer to pay the bill. He may be paying all the time because you haven't offered to pay.Since you two have talked about it and how you feel about it, there shouldn't be any arguments. Try being lighthearted about it, keeping your tone bright and cheery.   ”Nope! My turn!” ”Hey, you've covered like the last 10 meals. I'm paying tonight.” If he takes out his wallet, ”Uh-uh, put it away mister. Tonight is on me.”  , It doesn't need to be a big deal; just let him know that you'd like to pay for yourself once in a while, starting with this bill.   An alternate way is to split the bill by items. Instead of splitting in half or for what you have ordered make an agreement to split up by parts. For example, if he pays for dinner then you pay for drinks and dessert. If you are going to the movies, he can pay for the tickets and you pay for drinks and popcorn.  You can also take turns with who pays for what dates. This works well with friends, too. If he pays for dinner one night, the next time you go out, you pay. Then the next date you have he pays, and so on, back and forth. This is a good way to evenly split the responsibility of paying without having to do check math every time the bill comes.  If you are uncomfortable with him paying for everything, but you can't come to an agreement about it, then just plan for dates that are very inexpensive or free.There are tons of fun, low key things you can do that are cost effective.This way, you still get to date and have fun, without the stress of figuring out who is going to pay or worrying about getting into an argument about it.   For example, you and your boyfriend could go hiking or biking at a local park, take a trip to the beach, go to a free outdoor concert in your community, or stay in for a movie night.	Offer to pay. Split the bill down the middle.Another way to change it up is to offer to split the bill in half or to “go dutch” (each person paying for what they ordered) with the bill. Pay for alternate dates. Go on inexpensive or free dates.
You can also use other fabrics as well, such as cotton, linen, or twill.For a larger bag, cut your fabric into two 16 by 18-inch (40.64 by 45.72-centimeter) rectangles.; , Take one of the fabric pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the long edges and one of the narrow edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter). Secure the edges with sewing pins, then iron them flat.Do this step for both fabric rectangles.  Do not sew the two fabric rectangles together just yet. Simply sew along both of the side edges and the bottom edge on each piece. Remove the pins as you sew.  Take one of the fabric pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the top, raw edge down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron. Fold it down again, but this time by 2 inches (5.08 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron.Secure the folded edges with sewing pins, if you need to.  Sew it as close to the bottom, folded edge of the casing as you can. If you used sewing pins to hold the fabric down, be sure to remove them as you go. You can use a thread color that matches your fabric, or a contrasting color for something more interesting.  Use a color that either matches your bag, or contrasts with it. Avoid using cord that is too thin or too rough, or it will "bite" into your shoulder when you wear the bag.  The paper side is the smooth side. The rough side is the adhesive side.   Iron-on adhesive is also called "no-sew fusible web" and "heat-n-bond."  , Make sure that you are pinning the iron-on adhesive to the wrong side of the fabric. Also, make sure that the smooth, paper side of the iron-on adhesive is facing up.Consider using a contrasting or color for the fabric. For example, if your back is a solid black color, choose a colorful print for your appliqué.  Each iron-on adhesive will be a little different. If you are in doubt, start with a lower heat setting. Avoid using too much heat, or the glue will harden and become stiff., Cut right along the lines that you drew; there is no need to leave seam allowances.  Make sure that you are pinning the appliqué adhesive-side-down. Also, make sure that you are pinning it to the right side of your backpack piece.   You can also pin the appliqué to a pocket piece instead. You must do it before sewing the pocket onto the bag, however.  Again, avoid using too much heat, or the glue will harden and become brittle. Once the appliqué cools, pull the sewing pins out.  You can use a thread color that matches the appliqué, or you can use a contrasting one. If you are using a straight stitch, try to sew as close to the edge of the shape as you can. If you are using a zigzag stitch, sew right over the edge instead. This will help anchor your appliqué to the backpack as well as add some design., You can use the same color as your bag, or a contrasting color. Here are the recommended dimensions for the pockets:Inside: 6 by 7 inches (15.24 by 17.78 centimeters) Outside: 8 by 10 inches (20.32 by 25.4 centimeters)  , Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the short edges and one of the long edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If you need to, use sewing pins to keep the fabric in place.   Leave one of the long edges alone. You will be folding it differently.  Fold it by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) first, then press it flat with an iron. Fold it again, by this time by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press the edge flat with an iron once more. This will be the top edge of your pocket.  Try to get as close to the bottom fold as possible. You can use the same color thread as your fabric, or a contrasting one.  Pin the big pocket to the right side of your first backpack piece. Pin the small pocket to the wrong side of your other backpack piece. Try to pin the smaller pocket towards the top of the backpack piece.   If you wish to add an appliqué to the outside pocket, do that before you pin it.  When sewing your inside pocket, use a thread color that matches the backpack fabric. This way, the stitching won't be visible as much from the outside. You can use any thread color you want for the outside pocket: the same color as the pocket, or a contrasting on.   Do not sew along the top edge of the pocket. To prevent unraveling, sew back and forth a few times along the start and end of your sewing.  Make sure that everything is aligned.  Start just below the casing, and finish just below the casing. To prevent unraveling, sew back and forth a few times over the start and end of your sewing.   Do not start sewing from the top of the bag. If you do, you will sew the casing shut, and won't be able to use your bag.  Clip a safety pin to one of the 58-inch (147.32-centimeter) long cords. Starting from the front-left side of the bag, push it all the way through the front and back casing, until it comes out the back-left side of the bag. Repeat this step with the other cord, but start from the right side of the bag., Make a mark on the fabric where you need the grommets to go first, then make a small "X" shaped hole using a craft blade. Set the grommet using the manufacturer's instructions.   Do not make the hole too big. You want the fabric to stretch around the base of the grommet as you push it through. If you make the hole too big, the grommet will fall out.  Take both of the left-side cords, and pull them through the left grommet; you want the cords to be coming out of the front of the bag. Tie the ends of the cords into a tight, overhand knot. Repeat this step for the cords on the right side of the bag.   If the cords are too thin or the grommet is too big, the knot may not be able to hold the cords in place. Instead, pull just one of the cords through the grommet, then knot both ends of the cord together.	Cut two 12 by 14-inch (30.48 by 35.56-centimeter) rectangles out of durable fabric, such a canvas. Fold and press both of the long edges and one of the short edges by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter). Sew the folded edges down. Fold the top, raw edge down twice on each piece to make the casing. Topstitch the casing down. Cut two 58-inch (147.32-centimeter) long cords. Trace your design onto the paper side of the iron-on adhesive. Pin the iron-on adhesive to the fabric you want to use for your appliqué. Iron the adhesive using the recommended heat setting on the package. Let the iron-on adhesive cool, then cut the appliqué out. Peel the backing off, then pin the appliqué to the front of the backpack piece. Iron the appliqué using the recommended heat setting on the package. Topstitch the shape down. Cut out your inside and/or outside pockets. Fold and iron both of the narrow edges and one of the long edges by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Fold the remaining long edge down twice. Topstitch the top, folded edge down. Pin the pockets in place. Topstitch the pockets in place along the bottom edge and both of the side edges. Pin the two backpack pieces together, with the right sides facing in. Sew around the bottom edge and both of the side edges using a ⅝-inch (1.59-centimeter) seam allowance. Pull the cording through the casing. Set a grommet into the bottom corners of your bag, ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the edges. Pull the cords through the grommets, and knot the ends.
Keep in mind that there are many types of charm bracelets. Some are fancier than others, and some are larger than others. Gold is also more expensive than silver. So remember that price is a big factor too.; , Lobster clasp are the most common as it locks your bracelets at each end. Toggle is also very popular as it’s easily put on and taken off. Keep in mind that you might want a safety chain with your charm bracelet. A safety chain will insure that if your bracelet does come loose, you will still have the safety chain to keep the bracelet on your wrist.  You will want something that represents you as a person, maybe a hobby of yours, or important events in your life. For example, you might want to choose a wedding ring charm to remember your wedding day by or a baby shoe charm with your son/daughter’s name engraved on the bottom.  For instance, Christmas may be a big event in your family. If so, make it a day filled with love, laughter, and lots of presents!  , The London bus charm can remind you of the wonderful time you spend there with your family. It will help keep the memories cherished.  You've worked hard to find them, and paid for them, so take this precaution to prevent losing the charms.	Choose a charm bracelet what will fit your lifestyle. Pick a clasp that will suit you. Think about what you want on your charm bracelet. Have charms that symbolize your family. Pick out charms for places you have traveled to. After you have collected all of the charms for your bracelet, bring it in to a jeweler to have them soldered on securely.
Square throw pillows and covers for them are both very easy to sew, if you have a little bit of experience. Choose a firm batting and sew it into a tightly-stitched, stain-resistant pocket made from two pieces of identical cloth. Sew three sides first, stuff, check for evenness, and then sew up the last side. Slipcovers are a great way to add zest and character to your new pillows. Choose bold, fun fabrics with an eye to the décor of the room as a whole.   More complex slipcovers (such as those with ruffles and textured covers) can be made by following patterns available online or in fabric stores. A crazy-quilt slipcover can add a rustic Americana feel to the room, and is easy to make with fabric scraps and a bit of patience.  A wooden headboard is essentially just a big palette for your sense of style, if you want it to be. Lightly sand, prime, and repaint it however you want, or stitch together a cloth cover for it to change both its color and its reflectiveness quickly. Use stencils to add shapes in a contrasting color, such as leaves or birds.   Even more whimsical designs are possible, using fancy fabrics and crafting supplies. Try gluing seashells and a bit of craft sand to the board, and then covering the top part with ragged fishing net cloth to make a seaside look, for example.  Dedicated light fixtures are expensive and time-consuming to install, but portable and temporary solutions can dress up a room just as well. Use stick-on lights to illuminate kitchen cabinets or closets with the touch of your hand, or staple rope lights along the ceiling seam for an elegant and fun lighting option that's perfect for watching movies, having a romantic dinner, or spending time with a loved one in the bedroom. Rope lights are also useful for softly illuminating pantries and coat closets from above the door frame.   Simple Christmas lights can be used for beautiful illuminated garlands that add a touch of class to a living room or front room. Buy small lights all in one color; white is best for its versatility, but other colors may also be acceptable. Go to your local craft store and buy decorative garlands, preferably with a wire core. Wrap the lights in a spiral around the garlands and nail or staple the finished garland to the wall around a door frame or along the ceiling seam.  Change your garland with the seasons. Use a pine bough motif with berries and pine cones for winter, red and orange maple leaves for fall, and so on. Plug it into a wall outlet for an instant, dramatic effect.  A crochet rug is easy to make, and can combine any colors you want for a homey, personalized look. It's also a great way to recycle old T-shirts or bedsheets. Alternatively, try stenciling a pattern onto a plain area rug with durable fabric paint to make it more dramatic and interesting to look at.   Mats for the bathroom or front door can also be stenciled for a new look. Whenever you stencil a rug or mat, be sure to thin the paint first – it doesn't take much to produce a vibrant effect.	Sew your own pillows. Redesign headboards in bedrooms. Add inexpensive, dramatic lighting. Tie the room together with a homemade rug.
Detached tubs hearken back to a time when indoor plumbing was scarce. As such, built-in tubs were rare. The claw-foot tub is a classic design, and smooth porcelain was one of the most popular materials for early tubs due to the fact that it is an easy surface to clean.; , Like detached tubs, detached pedestal sinks recall an era before the widespread use of indoor plumbing. Select a curvy design to give your bathroom a Victorian look or a straight-edged, boxy design if you want to give your bathroom a Craftsman look, which is the style that immediately followed the Victorian era. If you don't want to lose storage space, consider retrofitting an antique dresser into a bathroom vanity.  The earliest toilets did not have a built-in tank. Instead, the tank and the bowl were separate, and the tank usually hung on the wall high about the wall. The handle was attached to the tank by a long metal chain.  Chrome and other shiny metals tend to create a modern ambiance. For a vintage style, opt for dull metals instead, like copper, wrought iron, nickel, and oiled bronze.	Install a claw-foot porcelain tub. Go with a pedestal sink. Include a toilet with a detached tank and chain handle. Look for the right metals.
Although in some situations you may need to expand your crafting repertoire, the best and most efficient way to contribute crafts to someone in need is to do what you already know. For example, a quilt guild may make quilts and jewelry makers should choose to make jewelry.   Try doing an Internet search that includes your craft and "for charity" in the search terms. This will give you examples of charities and what other people have done.; ,   Before donating crafts or money to a charity, ensure that it is authentic. You can check this at http://charitynavigator.org.  Many groups like to dedicate 1 month each year or a few weekends to making crafts to send to an organization they support. The more people who get involved, the more help you will be.  Consider creating a group that crafts for charity that includes teenagers or elderly people. A charity crafting class could be a mother/daughter operation, or it could take place at a retirement community. Many elderly people knit, crochet or embroider and may be interested in meeting with people who are of a different generation.  Most charities have instructions about the sizes of the crafts that are made, the materials and, in some cases, the patterns. Although most crafters love to be creative, make sure you are doing it within the confines of these instructions.  Corporate responsibility leads many large stores to look for charities to support, while local small businesses may enjoy both the ethical and marketing benefits of donating materials to a charity crafting group.   In most cases it is unlikely that all materials would be donated. You should expect to have to buy some materials. If you have a group, then you can share the burden of costs as well as time creating the project.  For example, October is breast cancer awareness month, so you could contribute to a charity and use pink material, and December is AIDS awareness month, so a red craft for an AIDS charity might be preferable. You can increase your craft knowledge while contributing to a number of charities.	Choose your craft. Find an organization that aligns with your craft and the part of society you would like to help. Ask your friends or crafting group if they would like to join you in giving to charity. Get instructions from the charity of your choice before beginning. Ask a local craft store if they want to donate supplies. Rotate your charitable crafts.
We already have a general theme "Holidays!". Although, what type of holidays? Is it maybe Easter Holidays, or Christmas holidays? It is up to you! In this article we will focus on making a Christmas theme bracelet, but you can easily change the colours to suit your holiday!; , Colours are very important in a bracelet, and they should suit the theme. Probably the first things that come in mind for "colours on Christmas" would be green and red, and maybe gold. These are great colours and complement Christmas decorations/clothes.   Remember your colour theme for the next step.  Searching for the right beads are sometimes hard, which is why you must plan, because planning prepares you. First, have a look around the selection of beads that match your colour choice, and think of a plan in your head. What do you want your bracelet to look like? Will it have big beads and small beads, will it follow a pattern, or will it have a small charm in the middle, then follow red and green small beads?  , Before purchasing the beads, visualize some different variations of the bracelet you would like to make, then buy the beads when/if you are sure you are happy with the selection you have. It is a good idea to buy a bit more beads than what you need in case you switch ideas for the bracelet, but remember do not over-buy beads!  , Hopefully your beads are still in separate little baggies.   Do not dump them all into a big container! It will be hard to find them!  , Find the centre of your piece: On the string you are using for the bracelet, find the centre to use for separation, or where you will put a charm in the middle. No matter the design, it is good to know the centre. Pattern or no pattern? Choose if you like a pattern on your bracelet like "red, green, gold, OR red, red, green, green, gold, gold. No matter what the pattern it should be repetitive and you should not stop halfway through. Continue the pattern all the way. Plain is a choice: Sometimes, less is more! Some simple bracelets look beautiful, especially if you use a three stranded bracelet (which is a bit more difficult) and use 1 row of red, another of green and last of gold, but that is up to you!  , Now that you are ready to start, make sure you know who you are making the bracelet for, so you have enough string. Maybe measure their other bracelets, and leave a bit more space in case you need it. Remember, if you have too little string, you cannot add more, but if you have too much, you can always cut it!  , The process of making a bracelet is hard, so prepare to be patient and take some breaks once in a while!  , You can begin by tying a knot on the beginning of the piece, then continuing with beading. Stop every now and then to check out how your pattern is going. Remember to check the middle!  , Once the bracelet is done, secure the ends in whichever method you use, or get a grown -up to help you do the ends. Wrap up the present and it is ready!	Choose a theme. Choose colours. Look for beads. Visualize. Prepare a little workspace where you will start. Then, start with planning:   Your bracelet should be balanced: Do not have huge beads on one side, and small beads on another, because that is not balanced and will most likely look bad. Start the bracelet. Be patient. Start. Done!
If your can does not allow water to drain, the potatoes will rot. Holes can be drilled or cut with a small saw. Drill as many holes as possible without making the trash can bottom too weak to hold in soil.; , Once the drainage holes are drilled, you can begin adding soil. It is best to use potting mix rather than soil from your garden, as potting mix produces the best results when container gardening. Begin by adding a layer about 10 inches (25 cm) deep.   You can mix in fertilizer if desired. A low-nitrogen fertilizer should be used, as high levels of nitrogen promote leaf growth at the expense of potato size. A "5-10-10" mix works well; this indicates that the fertilizer contains 5 parts nitrogen to 10 parts each phosphorous and potassium.  Small potatoes can be planted whole, but larger ones should be cut into smaller pieces. Each piece should have at least 3 "eyes," or dimples. After cutting the potatoes, allow the cut edges to air dry before planting.  Bury the seed potatoes about 4 inches (10 cm) under the potting mix. In a 32 gallon (120 L) garbage can, you should only need about 4 potatoes, spaced evenly apart. Place the garbage can into an area that receives direct sunlight for 4 to 6 hours a day.   Keep the soil moist as the potatoes grow. In mid-summer, you may have to water the potatoes once a day to keep the soil from drying out.  When the potato plants start growing, you should continually add potting mix to the garbage can to cover the plants' stems, making sure to leave the leaves exposed to the sun. This allows more room underneath the soil for new potatoes to grow.   You should continually build up this hill of soil throughout the growing season. This is why the trash can is such an effective vessel - it allows for plenty of vertical room to continually bury the plants' stems.  At the end of the growing season, you simply have to lay down a tarp and overturn the trash can onto it. You can then pick the potatoes off of the tarp. Do not reuse the potting mix for growing potatoes again, as this will make the plants more susceptible to disease.	Drill holes in the bottom of the trash can for drainage. Add a layer of potting mix to the trash can. Prepare your potatoes for planting. Plant the potatoes. Add more potting mix as the plants grow. Harvest the potatoes when they're ready.
As soon as you realize your apple tree needs pruning, it can be tempting to jump to it and start lopping off branches immediately. However, it is important to prune at the right time to avoid damaging your tree. Prune in the first month or two of spring, at least two weeks after the last frost.          If you need to, pruning can occur later in the spring and early in the summer. Avoid pruning in the fall, as new growth will be stimulated but will die off from the cold of winter.; , A well pruned healthy apple tree will be a poor shade tree; it should have significant spacing between branches.  Pruning requires some specific tools in order to prevent damage to the tree. The blades you use to cut branches should be proportional in size to the branches you cut. For small limbs, use hand pruners. Larger branches that are about 1” thick can be cut off with loppers. Use a saw (a folding saw works well) to cut any branches wider than 3”.  If your apple tree is a good shade tree, then it is an obvious candidate for pruning. However, pruning should not be done on all trees. Hold off on heavy pruning until your tree is at least three years old. If a significant amount of pruning needs to be done for a tree, do portions of it over several seasons.          Pruning young or small trees is done to encourage a strong framework and starting shape. Pruning large or matured trees encourages larger, healthier fruit and maintains the overall shape.	Know when to prune. Decide how much you need to prune. Get the right tools. Know which trees to prune.
If put in the kiln, this will probably make it explode. As outlined in the Wheel Throwing section, slam your clay on plaster (absorbs wetness) and knead it like bread.   If you'd like to check the insides to be sure, take a wire and cut it in half. If bubbles are still present, persist.  When you're hand building, there are generally three methods you can employ. Each creates a very different look. Slab works best for large pieces.           Pinch pots: Begin a pinch pot by forming a lump of clay into a smooth sphere that fits the size of the hand. This method is similar to the way the Native Americans shaped clay into useful pots. While holding the sphere of clay, press the thumb into the center of the ball, half-way to the bottom. While revolving the ball in one hand, press the walls out evenly with the thumb into the inside and the fingers on the outside. Smooth the surface with a damp sponge.  Coil Method: Coils of clay can be used to build bowls, vases and other forms in various shapes and sizes. Keeping the fingers flat, form the clay into sausage shapes, then roll into ropes 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) thick. Make a shallow dish with the pinch pot method and turn up-side down to serve as a foot of base. Place a coil along the edge of the foot. Dampen the fingers and join the next coil to it, with a little pressure. Keep adding coils. Coils may be pressed with the fingers or a tool on both the inside and outside to create interesting texture.  Slab Method: Place two strips of wood on canvas a little further apart than the width of the finished slabs. Working on a textured fabric will leave imprints on the clay slab. Place clay on the cloth between the strips of wood and roll out. Use a pointed tool to trim the slab of clay to desired size. You may make paper patterns to follow if a form that has a number of sides is desired. Rub a wet finger over the edges to be joined and score with a tool. Roll out a thin coil of sticky clay and place it along one edge. Press the two edges together. Slabs of clay may be placed over rocks, bowls, plastic forms etc. to create interesting shapes. As the clay dries, it shrinks away from the form but retains the shape of the form.If it is a medium or larger piece, make it hollow. Solid clay takes an eternity to dry and will explode in a firing most of the time.	Make sure that your clay has no bubbles in it. Pinch, coil or slab.

This can be found either from information in your owner's manual or on the Internet.  You should refer to your electrical schematic for help. You want to make sure that there are no breaks in the connection from the fuse box to the switch. If you did not find a schematic, it might be easier to trace the wiring from the switch back to the fuse box to look for any breaks in the connection., Attach the leads of the multi-meter to where the electrical wires come into the switch and set the meter to D/C volts. It should read 12 volts.  This is the path that a signal will travel to move your window when you press the switch. Any breaks or loose connections in this path will prevent your motor from functioning properly., Attach the leads of the multi-meter to where the electrical wires come into the motor. Again, set it to D/C volts and it should read 12 volts.  If there are any loose or corroded connections in the circuit they will disrupt the signal and cause your window to malfunction.  Push any connectors or wiring harnesses together tightly, and clean any corrosion away with a wire brush or similar tool. .  If your problem was in the circuitry and is now fixed, then your window should freely roll up and down without any restrictions or delays.	Find an electrical schematic of your vehicle. Trace the wiring from the fuse panel to the switch. Use a multi-meter to confirm that the switch is getting 12V of power. Trace the wiring from the switch to the motor. Use the multi-meter to confirm that the motor is getting 12V of power. Look for any interrupted voltage caused by a loose connector or corrosion. Fix the connector or corroded areas. Test the window again.
The leak will generally come from the discharge hose at the standpipe in the wall. Are there water stains running down the wall? Perhaps, when you turn the machine to drain, water comes out of the standpipe. Adjust the drainage hose if you suspect an obstructed flow or stopped up drain. Another common water leak can be a bad hose or loose connection. Pull out the washing machine and turn it on, allowing water to flow into the tub. Check at the back to ensure there are no cuts in the hose or at the connections as the tub fills. There are two hoses that are part of the cycle system. Check as it cycles to verify the clamps and hoses are in good condition.; ,   You need to remove the bottom panel from the washing machine using a Phillips head screwdriver. Possible leaks can be hidden under the washtub.  This would make water come from around the top of the washtub during the spin cycle.   Raise the top of the washing machine to check the gasket. It is normally held in place with two clips in the front. Insert a thin-bladed flat head screwdriver and pry the top up. The two clips are at the back and act like hinges. With the top up, visually inspect the gasket around the top of the tub for cracks, dirt or anything else that would keep it from sealing off the water.	Check where on the washer the leak is coming from. Get on the floor to check the bottom and back of the washing machine as it cycles through. Confirm whether you have a worn out gasket.
The term “RV” applies to a number of different types of vehicle, including Class A and Class C motorhomes, travel trailers, fifth wheels, and toy haulers. Think about what you will be using your RV for and plan accordingly. You can still compare across types, but knowing generally what you want can help narrow your search and save you time and effort.; , There are a number of different sites that have information about different manufacturers. However, you will usually have to pay a fee to get more complete information. But it is still worth a try with a free guide, because it might have just the information you are looking for.   A good place to start is http://www.nadaguides.com/rvs. This site has information about a huge number of different brands and models going back a number of years.  There are a number of different consumer guides available that compare a large number of different brands and models. These guides often include the vehicle specs and recommended pricing information. While they can cost about $100, they can save you a good deal of money and stress in the long run.   Two popular guides can be purchased at the following sites:   JR Consumer. This site offers a complete guide in both ebook ($68) and hardcopy ($78) formats, as well as a number of supplementary products. The guides provide information about make and model, price, value, and customer satisfaction. The guides only include information about 3 or 4 model years, so if you are looking for an older RV, make sure to purchase the appropriate guide.  RV Consumer Group. This non-profit site offers guides for individual purchase ($78), or memberships that include a package of informational products ($139). The guide offers information about price, reliability, value, control, and vehicle specs.  You can do an Internet search for something general, like “RV reviews,” or for a specific brand or model if you have something in mind.   Forums have the benefit of being free, but they do not usually have extremely specific information about a wide variety of models in a single place. Forums can be especially useful once you have narrowed your search.  If you have friends who have purchased RVs before, ask them about their experiences. Are they satisfied with the RV they purchased? Would they recommend a different manufacturer? The more information you have, the better, so ask around as much as you can.  When you feel that you are ready to actually go to an RV dealer, ask him or her for recommendations. Chances are, they will have good information about customer satisfaction from previous buyers. They may be able to give you information that you were not able to get from a consumer guide or online forum. It never hurts to get more first-hand information, so don’t be afraid to ask.	Do some research about the type of RV you want. Search for online consumer guides. Purchase a consumer guide. Read online forums. Talk to friends. Talk to your dealer.
Since you won't be doing any sewing for this, you want to find a fabric that does not fray, such as felt or flannel. Jersey/t-shirt fabric and tulle also make great choices.   This will create a child-sized cape. You can use larger measurements to make an adult cape.  Measure down from your child's neck down to where you want the cape to end. Add 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) to your measurement. Cut the fabric according to that measurement.The cape can be as wide as you want it to be.  Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the top edge down by 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) to make the casing. Secure the bottom edge with fabric glue or iron-on hem tape.Hot glue is not recommended for this because it is not flexible enough to gather. If you do know how to sew, you can sew the casing down, ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) from the bottom edge.  It can be the same color as the cape, or a contrasting one. Something between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) would work best.  If you want to tie the ribbon into a bow, cut it twice the length as the casing. You can also use a piece of silver or gold cording instead.  Secure a safety pin to one end of the ribbon. Use the safety pin to pull the ribbon through the casing., Slide the cape so that it is centered on the ribbon. Next, scrunch the cape on the ribbon so that it gathers. It should be about half the width it used to be., Cut the ribbon down to 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) on each side. Seal the ends with a lighter to keep them from fraying.  If you will be tying the ribbon into a bow, skip this step.  Place one Velcro closure on the front of one ribbon, and the other on the back of the other ribbon. Self-adhesive Velcro would work best. If you can't find any, you can glue on the regular kind with hot glue or fabric glue.  Consider hot gluing some pretty rhinestones over the front of one ribbon to make it fancier. If you left the ribbon long, cut the ends at angles, then seal them with a lighter. If you used cording instead of a ribbon, tie a knot into each end of the cord to keep it from fraying.  You can leave your cape as is, or you can add some finishing touches, such as rhinestones or paint. Use colors that go well with your cape, and remember, less is more. Here are some ideas to get you started:Paint on designs using fabric glue or puff paint. You can free-hand them or use fabric stencils. Use iron-on transfers to add designs to your cape. Glue rhinestones along the edges using fabric glue or hot glue. Use fusible web interfacing to glue appliqués onto the cape. Hot glue a feather boa to the bottom of the cape.	Choose your fabric. Cut the fabric to length. Make the casing. Cut a piece of ribbon that's just a little longer than the casing. Pull the ribbon through the casing. Scrunch the cape to gather it. Trim the ribbon down to make the closure. Add Velcro closures to the ribbon. Add the finishing touches.
Whether you rubbed oil or grease on your interior ultimately doesn’t matter for cleanup purposes. Here’s why:   Oils are defined as any compounds that are insoluble in water, soluble in organic solvents (non-polar things like gasoline), and liquid at room temperature.Grease, on the other hand, is simply an oil that has additives to make it semi-solid (kind of like Jell-O) at room temperature. These additives are solid and do not absorb into the surfaces inside your car.This means that, once you scrape off any excess contaminants from the surface of your interior, the stain left behind is an oil stain. Cleaning oil from cloth seats requires the same process you would use to clean it from carpet.; , You can use a paint scraper, spoon, or knife. It doesn’t matter if you use metal or plastic, but be cautious not to puncture your seat., This will remove any residual oil or grease that is left sitting on the surface of your interior. Use a dry paper towel or shop towel to do this., This will soak up the oil. Allow the baking soda to sit for 10-15 minutes., You can vacuum it up with a shopvac or sweep it up. If there is a large amount of oil, you might put more baking soda on the stain and repeat this cycle several times., If there is any stain left, you can repeat the process as long as you continue to see improvement. Instructions for sponging and blotting with a particular dry cleaner will be included on the manufacturer's bottle. Once you can no longer tell that this method is making a difference, you should move on to another method., A detergent such as Dawn is often enough to break up oil stains, especially fresh ones. You can also buy other over the counter grease/oil removers such as Goo Gone. This is the most common and straightforward way to remove a grease or oil stain., If a degreaser didn’t knock out the stain, you may need to use steam to coax it out. The steam will heat the fibers of your carpet and open up any pores in the fiber. This allows the carpet to “release” any trapped oil and gives you the chance to soak it up.   You can use a traditional steam cleaner to do this job. If you do not have a steam cleaner, you can place a brown paper bag over the stain to absorb the oils. Then, apply steam by putting a clothing iron on top of the bag to create the heat and steam to free the oils.	Understand the enemy. Scrape off any excess oil or grease. Blot the stain. Apply baking soda to the stain. Remove the baking soda. Clean the carpet with dry cleaning solvent if residual stains remain. Scrub with a degreaser. Steam the stained area.
A single horn generally has one main tuning slide. To locate this tuning slide, follow the tubing of your horn from the mouthpiece until you arrive at a tuning slide. This is your main tuning slide.   If your horn has more than one tuning slide, you likely have a double horn and you will also need to adjust the B flat tuning slide.; , Play your instrument for at least 3 to 5 minutes, going through scales or practicing musical and fingering patterns or even just blowing warm air through the instrument, a cold instrument never plays as well, this is all to warm up your own playing as well as the instrument. Also cold air temperature will make an instrument react and play differently, tending towards playing flat. The instrument will also warm up as you play, and the tone will shift slightly and become more predictable., In order to match the tune that the rest of the orchestra or ensemble is playing, match your tone to a consistent tuner (usually the oboe), it is best if the other hornists in your ensemble are there and you can all match the same pitch. Alternately, use a bar or electric tuner, tuning fork or even a well tuned piano.  The approximate position for the main tuning slide is about ¼ inch to ½ inch out. With the tuning slide all the way in, the notes should sound sharp, with it all the way to it is flat. You can listen to your tuner's pitch and yours to determine if you are sharp or flat.  If the piano is playing F above middle C, play the corresponding open note (meaning there are no valves being pressed). Play the third C that would correspond with the middle C on a “horn in F.”, You will want to tune the horn to match the sounds that will emerge when you play it in performance. Keep the positioning and size of your hand’s coverage in the bell consistent as you tune.  As you play this open note with the piano or other tuning instrument, you will hear if your note is flat (below the note) or sharp (above the note). Pull the tuning slide out to draw down sharp tones, or push the slide in to push up flat notes. It might take practice to hear if your pitch is right or wrong, it is a difference but it seems small at first Even though these are minor adjustments, they do impact how much air must travel through the horn and therefore impact how the tone sounds.  If you are playing a double horn, your next step is to tune the horn so that it’s in tune with itself.Press the thumb valve to switch over to the horn’s B flat side. Play F again above middle C on piano. Slide between the F and Bb on the horn. Leave the main tuning slide alone and only adjust the Bb tuning slide the same way as the F slide.  You have now tuned the open note (notes played with no valves pressed down). Now you need to tune closed notes, or those that are played while pressing valves down. You can use an electronic tuner, piano, tuning fork, or similar instrument to help you, but you can also use your ear to listen for sharp or flat notes.   Play your middle C, which you just tuned. This should be perfectly in pitch now. Play either fourths, fifths or an octave above the tuned middle C for each valve. For example, to tune first valve, play F above your middle C. It is much easier to compare notes with middle C and hear the intonation between notes that are distant from each other, such as an octave apart. Adjust the valve tuner for each valve note you play to sharpen or flatten the note. To sharpen, push the slide valve tuner in. To flatten, slide the valve tuner out. Repeat for each valve.For a double horn, you should have six valves (three on the F side and three on the B flat side).  If you have pulled out all the tuning slides and the horn is still sounding too sharp, then you likely need to provide more coverage with your right hand inside the horn’s bell. Similarly, if you have pushed in the slides all the way and you are still flat, then you will need to adjust how much of your hand is inside the bell, instead making the coverage area smaller., Mark the slides after you’ve tuned and adjusted the slide. This will give you a good indication of where the slide should sit to be in tune, although you will still need to tune your horn in comparison to the other instruments with which you are playing.   Marking your slides is especially useful for when you need to empty condensation or saliva from the horn in the middle of a performance. Emptying condensation will usually throw off the pitch a bit. To offset this, make sure you take note of where you’ve put the valve mark so you can return the tuning slide to the correct location quickly. Alternately, you can measure where the tuning slide sits with your fingernail or knuckle and easily return the slide to its proper location after emptying condensation.  The complexity of the French horn is such that you cannot achieve perfect pitch for every note. You will need to compromise by choosing the middle ground on tuning.	Locate your tuning slide(s). Warm up your instrument. Use a tuning instrument to play an F above middle C. Tune your horn to match the arrangement in which you’re playing. Listen to see if you match pitch. Play the horn to match the tuning instrument’s note. Keep your right hand in the horn’s bell. Adjust the main F tuning slide. Tune the B flat slide. Tune the horn’s closed notes. Ensure you have enough coverage with your hand in the bell. Mark your tuning slides with a soft-leaded pencil. Be ready to compromise.
Use a glass cleaner and some paper towels to clean the inside of the window before beginning to paint the frame. This will keep any dust and dirt that may be gathered on the window from getting into the paint.  Use painter's tape to cover any hardware or areas that are not meant to be painted, such as hinges, locks and catches. If removing these items is easier than covering them with tape, take them off the window and set them aside., Prevent paint from getting onto the glass by taping off the window with painter's tape., Muntins are horizontal pieces of wood going across the window. Paint them slowly with a small paintbrush, making even strokes across the wood from 1 end of the window to the other., Using the same strokes and brush as on the muntins, paint the top and bottom horizontal pieces of the window pane.,,,, Do this while the paint is in the process of drying. If the tape is not removed until after it the paint is completely dry, it can chip paint off the window frame., This may take up to 24 hours to dry completely., Use a paint scraper to gently rub away at any paint marks that are on the window. If the paint scraper is too large to manage or reach the corners, try using a small razor blade.,	Clean the window. Tape the hardware. Tape the window. Paint any muntins. Paint the horizontal pieces.Paint the vertical cross pieces.Paint any additional top, bottom or side pieces of wood that are on the window pane.Paint the window molding. Remove the painter's tape from the glass and hardware. Allow the paint to dry on the window frame. Scrape off any paint that landed on the glass.Once the paint is dry, replace any hardware that was removed before the window painting process.
Cut a rectangle around your traced blade to separate it from the main slab. You will need a stiffer hacksaw for thicker steel. This rectangle is what you will grind down to form the profile of the blade.  Put the rough cut blade into a vise and grind away excess metal. Follow the guidelines to form the profile. Use the grinder to finalize the shape of the blade.  Gently grind the edge into a slope with the flap wheel. Make sure that the slope does not go past the middle of the blade. Make this slope on each side of the blade. Doing this forms the actual edge of the blade.   Go slowly during this step, as grinding too much can ruin the blade, forcing you to start over.  Use a drill bit that is the same size as the rivets that you intend to use. Put the holes in the tang. Depending on the size of the blade, you may need a varying number of holes.  Sand the blade using successively finer grits of sandpaper, up to 220 grit. Be sure to take the time to sand out any scratches. Sand all areas of the blade. This will increase its luster and quality.   Sand in opposite directions each time you change grits. You can use a file to add ridges to the inside near the handle. Trace a pattern and file the metal away.	Use the hacksaw to cut the metal. Grind the profile. Grind the edge. Drill your rivet holes. Finish the blade.
If you take a cutting, choose one with a lot of roots on it. This can be planted straight into the garden as they root extremely easily.; , Vietnamese mint will grow best in well-draining, fertile soil that stays moist. Add some well-rotted manure or compost to enrich the soil if needed. Choose an area with bright dappled shade, and where it will definitely get shade during the hottest part of the day.  The mint needs lots of water to establish well.   This plant grows fast so you might want to consider containing it within a container.  Remember that it's tropical, so it needs a wet season, or a simulation of one.  A soluble fertiliser with a high proportion of nitrogen or a complete plant food is ideal, given occasionally during the spring and summer months.  Vietnamese mint grows rapidly and is ready for harvesting within a month, so it needs to be pruned regularly to keep its rampant growth in check.  The leaves are best between spring and autumn but can be harvested all year. Harvesting can begin about 4-6 weeks after the initial planting.  Vietnamese mint is excellent washed, chopped, and added to salads and Thai and Vietnamese dishes. It's a far more authentic addition to cold/fresh spring rolls than common mint. It is best used fresh.	Take a cutting or purchase seeds or a seedling from the local nursery. Prepare the soil. Plant early spring or during the wet season. Water well and frequently. Fertilise. Prune regularly. Harvest. Use.
Extend your arm straight out so that it is perpendicular to the rest of your body.   You can work with either the left or right arm. It is easiest to take an accurate measurement for your Armhole if you have a second person helping you. Your helper will need to use the tape measure while you keep your arm in position. If you do not have a helper to assist you, it might be easiest to measure the Armhole of your non-dominant arm while using your dominant hand to hold and maneuver the tape measure. You should stand in front of a full-length mirror, as well.; , Position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure flat against the the center of your shoulder. Draw the tape measure down over the front of your shoulder and arm, pausing once it hits the center of your armpit.   This measurement is sometimes referred to as your Armhole depth.It is not a full Armhole measurement, however, so you should keep going if you need the full measurement instead of the depth measurement. Keep the tape measure flat against your body. It should also be vertically straight along the front of your body.  Continue wrapping the tape measure around your arm and shoulder, drawing it up from behind your shoulder until it meets the starting end.This measurement is your full Armhole measurement. The tape measure must be vertically straight along the back and front of your shoulder. Make sure that it also lies flat against your body. Note that your full Armhole measurement should be twice as large as your Armhole depth. Since it may not be exactly twice as large, though, it is best to take the actual measurement instead of mathematically doubling the depth measurement.  With the tape measure held in place, move your arm around. Rotate it back and forth, then up and down. The tape measure should not be tight enough to restrict the movement of your arm in any way.   As a general rule, place two fingers underneath the measuring tape and against your body as you take the measurement. Do not stretch the tape, either. Following these two precautions should prevent the Armhole from being too tight.When in doubt, a measurement that is slightly too large is better than one that is too small.	Raise your arm. Wrap the tape measure from the shoulder to the armpit. Wrap the tape measure back up to the shoulder. Keep it comfortable.
Place the nylon in a bucket and cover it with lukewarm water. Allow it to soak overnight, or for at least eight hours.   Soaking the nylon makes it easier for the dye to penetrate its fibers, and a long soak will ensure that the fibers are evenly drenched. With chemical dyes, warm to hot water is necessary, but room temperature water will suffice for food coloring dye.  Add warm water to a large saucepan or stockpot until it is one-half to two-thirds full. Mix your chosen food coloring into this water, stirring until evenly combined.   Make sure that you have a large enough pot and enough water for the amount of nylon being dyed. Test the pot size before you add the water by stuffing the nylon inside. The nylon fill no more than one-quarter of the pot. You will need about 1 qt (1 L) of water for every 1/4 lb (110 g) or less of nylon. For instance, if you are dyeing one pair of nylon stockings, 1 qt (1 L) of water will usually suffice. The right amount of food coloring can be tricky to determine. For a vibrant color, you will need at least 10 drops for every 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Vary the amount as desired to lighten or deepen the shade.  Add the nylon to the dye bath, making sure that it is completely submerged. The dye bath must be allowed to soak into all the fibers of the material.   Stir the nylon as it sits in the dye bath. You will need to stir it almost constantly throughout the entire dyeing process if you want to maintain an even color.  Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it on medium until the dye bath reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).The dyeing process is almost always triggered by heat, no matter what kind of dye you use. If you want the dye to be its brightest and most vibrant, this is the minimum temperature you will need the dye bath to reach. Do not allow the dye bath to reach a rolling boil, however.  Pour a little white vinegar into the dye bath, mixing it in gently. Vinegar will help the color set into the nylon.   The amount of vinegar also varies based on the amount of water you use. As a general rule, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of white vinegar for every 1 cup (250 ml) of water in your dye bath., Turn the heat source off and remove the pan from the stove. Allow it to sit until the dye bath cools to room temperature. Do not remove the nylon during this time.   The water will be close to clear when the nylon is done dyeing. If you do not notice a change in the color of the water after 20 to 30 minutes, place the pan back on the stove and heat it again to reactivate the dyeing process.  Take the nylon to a large sink and rinse it under warm, running water until the water runs clear., Gently squeeze the excess water out the material using your hands, but do not wring the material out since doing so can damage the fibers. Allow the nylon to sit out flat or hang in a warm location with good air circulation until fully dry.   You may need to gently stretch the nylon as it dries if you want the material to lie flat. If you allow the nylon to dry without stretching it, the end result will likely have wrinkles.	Soak the nylon. Mix the dye bath. Dunk the nylon in the dye bath. Heat the bath. Add vinegar. Cool the dye bath. Rinse the nylon. Let the nylon dry.
You may love a character, and think you could cosplay her perfectly, but if she’s not very well known, you’re not likely to get much of a response from other people. The best characters to cosplay as are iconic and distinctive. They don't need to be the most well-known characters, but you will want at least a fraction of convention attendees to know who you're playing as.   If being seen as attractive is your priority, think about which characters members of the fan community are most attracted to, and which ones you find most beautiful.; , Cosplay means costume art to some, but truly dedicated cosplayers act out their character. This requires having a solid knowledge of the character's motivations, history and psychology.Look into the source material and give yourself a crash course in the character. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them yourself. What is her darkest secret? How would she react to a stranger? What hobbies does she have? These may not have a big effect on the character's personality, but it helps you get into the proper mindset.   For example, if you're going as Rei Ayanami from the Neon Genesis Evangelion universe, it helps to watch the show closer to the date of the convention. Observe the way she is animated, and pay attention to her character arc. A good cosplayer might simply act shy and mysterious, but the best cosplayers will try to get into the actual mindset of the character.  To be a great cosplayer, you should be able to capture the essence of your character in a single pose. Without movement or talking, frame your body in such a way that expresses something of the character's personality. Practice some poses in front of the mirror and see if something sticks. If you're having a trouble finding one that really works, try looking up artwork or promo photos for the character you're cosplaying as and copy it.   For instance, an action-based character like someone from the Kingdom Hearts series may suit a battle-ready stance. On the other hand, a schoolgirl-type character from the shojo manga Love Hina. Anime characters are often boldly characterized, so it shouldn't be difficult to pinpoint the dominant mood for the character you're going as.  Poses are best-suited for photo ops. If your costume is impressive enough, you're bound to get a lot of attention. Having a few good poses will maximize how good you look in photos., Dressing up as an attractive anime girl can be an open invitation for some of these less desirable types. If someone like this approaches you or makes a comment you're not comfortable with, the best thing you can do is ignore it and walk away. Nothing breaks character like genuine stress, and you don't want negative feelings to get in the way of your convention experience.   If someone is persistently harassing you, it's a good idea to contact security.  Cosplay if ultimately about expressing yourself, and the best way to do that is through confidence. If you're confident about what you're doing, the cosplay act will come more naturally. Of course, this may be easier said than done for a lot of people. Confidence is not the sort of thing that happens overnight. Nonetheless, you should pat yourself on the back for the fact alone you are putting yourself out there via cosplay. Cosplay takes courage, and simply being interested in doing it means you've got what it takes.  One of the great things about cosplay is that it is a communal activity. Chances are there are others who have cosplayed as the same anime character you've chosen. Looking online at sites like Cosplay.com and Kotaku will yield lots of inspiration.Take a look at the details in costumes you see. Are there any liberties taken with the source material? Any effective makeup techniques? In the end, you want to be your own attractive anime girl, but it doesn't hurt to lean on the innovations of others when you find yourself stuck.   Some cosplayers combine characters for a hybrid cosplay. This is only recommended if you really know what you're doing., Find some pictures of your chosen anime character for reference. From there, you should be able to break down what you need for the costume. Some costumes are easier to put together than others. Many anime characters use a "schoolgirl" aesthetic; the clothes for costumes like this can be purchased at stores. More elaborate designs will require sewing on your part. If you want to have an attractive costume, it's important that your costume shows off your figure. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing a high-cut skirt, but it does mean you should do without costumes that blanket your figure.   If you're in a bind, the Japanese "schoolgirl" outfit is a great pick. Even if you don't end up representing a character in particular, you'll definitely fit in with the crowd.  While it's still recommended you base your costume choices around a certain character, wearing a skirt is a standard look for the Japanese schoolgirl. Many anime girls match this look. Luckily, skirts of this sort can be purchased from a department store, or ordered online.  Boots are a bold type of clothing, and will make your costume more attention-grabbing. Boots already fit into a lot of anime costume designs, but you should choose your footwear to suit the character you've chosen.   If you're going for a schoolgirl look, boots may be too assertive. Cosplay costumes can get incredibly expensive. When you're first starting out, it's recommended you try to keep costs to a minimum. This will make sure you are able to afford other costumes as time goes on. Only seasoned cosplayers should let themselves settle into a single costume.  How you go about making a costume depends on how skilled you as a seamstress. To get a more specific costume for your anime character, you can sew, cut and hem existing pieces of clothing to fit your costume. In most cases, the clothes you use for this purpose will be permanently changed, so it's best to use old clothing you don't normally wear anymore or go shopping at a thrift store., Fabric that is flimsy, stretchy, or shiny tends to be very difficult to sew, which can lead to extremely unflattering costumes. Unless you are an extremely confident sewer, avoid these fabrics.Plain and medium weight fabrics are the easiest for beginners to sew with. Look for natural fabrics like poplin, cotton broadcloth, and lightweight wools.Darker prints make it easier to hide imperfect seams.If you're using patterned fabric, go for a small pattern rather than a large one. A large pattern will need to be matched up at the seams, which is much harder to do., Detailed costumes are great, but if you're in a pinch, you can usually do something simple to make your costume distinctive or recognizable. Depending on your knowledge of anime, you may be able to think of ways to spruce up your look. Even if you only have a schoolgirl costume, adding a Pokeball (from the Pokemon universe) will signal to everyone that you're playing as someone from that world.  Anime is a very distinctive animation style, and the most distinctive thing about it is arguably the way in which eyes are exaggerated. Cosplaying as an anime girl, you can get these bigger eyes with makeup.Pencil your eyes with a white eyeliner, and extend the frame of your eyes using a light-shaded eyeshadow. Eyeshadow should be used to create a new, wider shape for the eyes. Lightly smudge it where the eyeshadow ends for a blended look.   While this is more eyeshadow that you may be used to wearing, the rest of your eye makeup should be kept mild. This will make the bigger eyes more believable. Exceptions should be made if your character suits a different kind of eye makeup.  Because eyes are so important to the anime drawing style, you want to bring as much attention to the eyes as possible. Contact lenses are a quick and relatively affordable way of spicing up your look.Study the design of your character's eyes, and make a judgement call whether you think coloured contacts would fit her loo.  Female characters in anime tend to be very stylized. Many anime girls look like dolls, and makeup should be used to get that look. Blush can get used to get the reddened cheeks of anime characters. You may also want to make your face paler using foundation and concealer. Watch the anime your character is based in if you need specific inspiration for the look. The best cosplays are specifically based around the details of a character.   Makeup is a less important part of cosplaying, so you shouldn't worry about it too much if makeup isn't your forte.  It is recommended that you try to style your hair based on a character. With that said, straightening your hair will give you a more Japanese look. Bangs are also a staple hairstyle in anime. It's recommended you find a picture of your favourite anime character and get a hairstylist to match your hair to it.   Wigs are also a possibility. Suitable wigs for your costume should be available at a costume store.  Cosplay has a very passionate and inclusive community. If you don't already have friends that are into it, it's a good idea to meet some fellow fans. Because it's such a popular subculture, cosplay groups are quite easy to hook up with online.Look for public groups on social media sites like Facebook. If you join up with one of these groups, you can begin making friends by listing some of your favourite animes.  Depending on where you live, some travelling may be required. Cosplay conventions range significantly in size and scope. At first, it is recommended you choose a smaller one. They're less overwhelming, and it's easier to make friends with people when there's less chaos.Conventions usually cost around $20-60 USD to attend per day.  While doing a cosplay project on your own is perfectly fine, many cosplayers find it more enjoyable to go as a group. If you're planning on going to a convention with some friends, you might decide as a group to dress as characters from a certain anime. Theme groups tend to leave a much bigger impression at conventions than individual costumes.   Groups are also safer to go in. Conventions sometimes come with the risk of guys who harass attractive cosplayers. If you're in a group, it'll be easier to keep them at bay.  Some of them may be interested in taking your picture. Although it's usually to be taken as a compliment if someone asks to take your picture, it's ultimately up to you whether you're comfortable for that or not. Politely decline and move on if you're not okay with it.   If you're worried about harassment, going in a group can help alleviate the pressure. It's usually recommended you have a friend there to look out for you in the slight chance there's an issue.  You might not think so at first, but cosplay conventions can be physically exhausting. Walking around and posing all day can have an effect on anyone's fatigue. It's recommended you prepare for a convention day by doing 5-10 minutes of light stretches and warming up before heading in.Stretch out your arms and legs to make sure they're limber. Neck and arm rolls will ease the risk of strain throughout your day.  The most important thing at any convention is that you enjoy yourself. Preparing for a convention can be stressful, and conventions themselves can feel overwhelming at first. Once you get past the worst of it however, they can be a ton of fun. There are many things you can do to maximize your enjoyment of conventions:   Take your own photos.Why wait for others to photograph you? Take photos of yourself and other cosplayers. It's a great way to immortalize the memory. Check out anime booths. There's often a lot of interesting fan merch for sale. If you're a fan of anime, you'll find plenty to love. Taking some money with you to purchase souvenirs can be fun. Socialize and meet people. Everyone at the convention is ultimately there because they share a love of the same artform. This can be the foundation to meet new lifelong friends. Even if lasting friendships don't come out of it, it can still be great to talk shop about common interests.	Choose a recognizable character. Know your character. Plan some poses. Ignore negative attention.Unfortunately, for all of the great things conventions can offer, they are also notorious for attracting haters and creeps. Be confident. Look online for inspiration. Design a costume. Wear a skirt. Aim for colourful boots.Because anime is usually so stylized, characters' shoes tend to be bright and bold. Modify a pattern or existing garment. Use a plain or natural fabric. Make your costume distinctive.In a lot of cases, people are only going to have a few seconds to admire your costume before their gaze turns elsewhere. Enlarge your eyes. Try wearing contact lenses. Rose your cheeks. Straighten and bang your hair.There is no single "anime haircut" for girls. Get into the community. Choose a convention.The idea of going to conventions can be daunting if you haven't made a habit of going already. Consider going in a group. Decide whether you want your photo taken.Some people go to cosplay conventions purely with the interest of checking out other peoples cosplays. Warm up. Have fun!
It’s easier to do this with the paper turned like a diamond. Bring the top point down so that it meets the bottom point. Crease the fold well and unfold the sheet.   A standard 6-inch by 6-inch (15-cm by 15-cm) square of origami paper is perfect for this process. Otherwise, you can cut a typical sheet of printer paper into a square.; , Keeping the sheet oriented as a diamond, fold the left point over until it meets the right point. Crease the paper well before unfolding it back into its original shape.After doing this, your sheet should have two perpendicular crease marks. One should go from the top corner to the bottom, and the other should go between the side corners. The two crease marks should intersect in the center of the paper.  Again, keep the sheet oriented like a diamond rather than a square. Fold the top of the sheet so that the top point meets the center of the paper, where the diagonal creases intersect. Crease the folded edge.  Fold until the bottom point completely covers the folded top point. Crease the new fold. The corner should meet the center of the top edge.Note that there should now be a total of six points: three on the left and three on the right.  Both folds should start at the middle of the sheet’s bottom edge, running parallel to the edges at the bottom corners.Fold the lowest right-hand corner up so that it meets the middle of the upper edge. Repeat this fold with the lowest left-hand corner, bringing it together with the fold made on the right.   Crease both folds well. The bottom edge should now be a point where to diagonal edges meet.  Fold the tips of the two top corners and two side corners inward. You should now have edges instead of corners, completing your heart.	Fold a square piece of paper in half diagonally. Fold the square diagonally in the opposite direction. Fold the top corner down to the center. Fold the bottom corner up to the top edge. Fold the right and left sides towards the center crease. Turn the heart over and fold the points.
Choose two contrasting colors of duct tape to make your bow.  Before you make the bow itself, it is a good idea to cut out a small strip of duct tape (about 0.25 inches, or about 0.64 centimeters, in width) for the centerpiece. This will make it easier to secure the bow later. Stick the strip of duct tape to the edge of a table where you can easily grab it.  Taking the second roll of duct tape, cut out a piece 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length. Fold it neatly in half (lengthwise), sticky sides together, leaving just a small strip of adhesive exposed at the end.  Take both ends of the strip of duct tape and curl them upwards, to form a circle. Stick the ends together, using the small strip of adhesive that you left exposed earlier. The duct tape should now form a circular shape, like a cuff.  Flatten the circle of duct tape and pinch the edges together, in the center, to form a bow shape.  Take the small strip of duct tape you cut out earlier and wrap it tightly around the center of the bow to secure.  Stick it to a headband or barrette for a funky hair piece or attach it to bags, clothing, hats, etc.	Choose your duct tape. Cut out the center piece. Cut out an 18 inch (45.7 cm) strip of duct tape. Stick the ends together. Pinch the center of the circle. Secure the bow. Attach the bow to anything you like!
Otto Link makes an amazing ebonite mouthpiece for jazz, as does Meyer. Vandoren v16 and Java are specifically for jazz, while the V5, as long as it is open, is a great saxophone mouthpiece.

Use a utility knife or similar tool to cut the paint around the hardware to prevent paint from peeling off with surface to which the hardware is attached. Cut around fasteners and carve paint from their slots with your knife.   Remove fasteners with the appropriate tool and take off the hardware. In most cases, a screwdriver or claw hammer work well for fastener removal., Use an old pot for this. After boiling the hardware, do not re-use this pot for cooking to prevent food from becoming contaminated with paint particles. Fill the pot halfway with water or enough so the hardware is completely covered. Boil hardware for 10 to 20 minutes.For especially thick or stubborn paint, you may want to use a longer boiling time. Boil your hardware for a few hours for best results. A quart (950 ml) of water mixed with ¼ cup of baking soda should intensify the paint stripping power of this method., Remove the hardware from the water with tongs. Put on gloves so you can handle the hot hardware. Hold the hardware in your gloved hands and use a tool, like a putty knife, to scrape the loosened paint from the hardware.   As the hardware cools, the paint will become more difficult to scrape free. Dunk your hardware back into the hot water with your tongs to soften it again. Use a soft bristle brush to remove paint any remaining paint from the hardware. Brushes can be especially useful for removing paint from cracks and crevices.	Unfasten the hardware. Boil the hardware in water. Scrape off the paint.
Used book stores, library book sales, and thrift stores are good places to find a tome that will suit this purpose.  Look for something with an attractive cover in a color that suits your (or your recipient's) style. Some old books are bound with leather (or a lookalike) and embossed. Look around for textbooks, mismatched/outdated encyclopedias, Reader's Digest Condensed Books or anything that you think will be worth more for its cover than its contents.; , You can use scissors or a craft knife. Open the cover and cut along the gutter (crease) line.       Empty cover, ready to become a purse.  If you like, hang onto the pages or part of them for use in a collage or other paper crafts. Text, even if it's nothing in particular, can lend character to craft projects, and things like old encyclopedias can be great sources of images and inspiration. You can also cut out text to glue onto the cover of the book- the name of the person, etc.  Heavy mailing envelopes work fine., Cut slightly INSIDE your tracing lines so that you get a cardboard rectangle that is just slightly smaller than your book cover(s).,,, This will support and reinforce the bottom of your new purse.,, You may starch the fabric to make it stiffer and easier to use if you like., Lay the cardboard on the cloth and cut around it, leaving an inch or so in every direction.,,       Fold a quarter yard (23cm) of fabric into quarters (fold once along a vertical centered fold line, then once along a horizontal fold line). You should end up with a rectangular shape, with folds on two adjacent edges and four layers of material. Measure and mark the following:       One spine width from the corner where the two folded edges meet, along the edge with two folds. This measurement is shown by the red line in the previous diagram. One book cover width from the corner where the folded edges meet, down either of the longest sides. This measurement is shown by the blue line in the previous diagram. A diagonal line from the end of the first measurement to the end of the second measurement.             Blue line is the folded edge. The red line is a folded edge that should be cut to separate the triangle(s) from each other.  Cut the triangles from the markings you made.       You should now have two triangles that measure as follows: A = twice the spine width. B = the length of the short side (width) of the book cover. C = the distance that you want your book purse to open up. Repeat the process to make two more triangles with these dimensions, making for a total of four triangles.  (see photo for pointers), Right sides together.,,,, Stitch up the fold at least an inch. This will help your purse to close cleanly without the fabric bunching outward., You may glue the fabric to the front side if you wish as well., Be certain that the dart lies to the inside of the cover. Glue into place.,, Glue into place.,,,,,,,,	Obtain a largish hardcover book.  Cut the pages away from the cover.  Trace the book cover onto some firm pressed cardboard.  Cut your tracing out.  Cut the spine section away. ,  Check to see that the cardboard cutouts fit the covers of the book, and that their edges fit slightly INSIDE the edges of the book covers. ,  Cut a piece of pressed cardboard slightly smaller than the size of the book spine.Launder your fabric.  Iron the fabric smooth.  Use your cardboard rectangles as a template to cut your cloth.  Repeat for the spine cardboard piece. , Cut the ends of your purse.  Trim the top of the fabric to one quarter inch (or so) longer than the width of the cover.  Sew the long sides of each pair of triangles.   Turn and press the seam. ,Top stitch.Fold the bottom, narrow edge of your triangle in half to form a dart at the bottom. By hand or by machine, begin your stitch slightly less than halfway from fold to edge.    Cover the two large cardboard rectangles with fabric, gluing the edges to the back side.  Place the narrow, darted edge of the triangle(s) onto the inside, spine ends of the book cover.Lay one of the thin strips of cardboard on the back side of its fabric.  Wrap the short ends of the fabric over the short ends of the spine cover.  Glue the long, raw edges of the triangles to the top and bottom edges of the book cover to form the sides of your purse. ,  Make two loops of bias tape, one to hold the button/bead closure and one for the button to slide through. ,Place the bias tape loops in the center of the openings and glue them carefully to the edges.

To stand at ease, you can relax and stand comfortably, but do not talk or move around. Stand with your feet shoulder distance apart. Place your left hand in the small of your back. Your right hand will hold your instrument, unless you are carrying a drum, which will be held in front of you.; , Lift your left leg up and bring it down to the ground on the count of 1. At the same time, bring your left arm from behind your back and place it on your left side. Your thumb will rest on the seam of your pants. On the count of 2, bring your heels together.  Keep your heels together and your toes straight out. Straighten your legs, trying not to stiffen your knees. Rest evenly on your heels and balls of your feet. Draw your hips slightly back beneath your shoulders.  Stretch your neck out as long as possible without creating tension. Hold your chin level to the field and focus your eyes forward on a distant point in space., Hold your instrument parallel to the ground, or in uniform with the other instruments in your section. On the count of 1 extend your instrument directly out away from you. On the count of 2, grasp the instrument with your left hand. On the count of 3, bring your instrument into playing position.  Your starting position on the chart is listed in a coordinate system of horizontal and vertical values.   Instead of an X and Y coordinate, this might be listed as a number of steps Left or Right (on either side of the 50 yard line) and a number of steps in front of or behind the hash line that runs parallel to the Visitor-Home sidelines.Drill charts are read from the viewpoint of the director. If the chart says “in front of” it means toward the director. If the chart says “behind” it means away from the director’s viewpoint.  In order for the marching band to look uniform, it’s important that everybody moves about the same distance with each step they take. Drill chart instructions will be listed in steps.   The standard marching style is called 8-to-5, which means there are 8 steps for every 5 yards. Since there will be 5-yard lines on a standard football field, it creates a grid marchers can follow, counting 8 steps between each line. You can also think of each step as being an average of 22.5 inches, since there should be 8 steps in 5 yards. This measurement is often used as a standard. More important than knowing the average size of a standard step while you’re marching is to be moving at the same pace as those around you., Each position in a drill chart corresponds to a count in the music. As the song progresses, you will move across the field into a new position. You will start on the count of 0 and generally move in increments of 8., 8-to-5 is the most common marching style. Every step is 22.5 inches. In other words, you will take 8 steps between every 5 yard line. You will start with your left foot and end on your right.   Another common style is the 6-to-5 style, which means 6 (30 inch) steps per 5 yards.  Lift your leg high in the air with your thigh parallel to the ground and your calf vertical to the ground with your toes pointed. Break the step into 4 motions.   On the count of 1, lift your left heel off the ground, keeping your toes pointed. On the count of 2, lift your left leg into a chair position, keeping your toes pointed. On the count of 3, drop your left leg so the toe is pointed and the heel is off the ground. On the count of 4, drop your left heel to the ground. Repeat this for your right leg.  Keep your legs straight while you march. Start by lifting and moving your left foot forward. Plant your heel into the ground first, keeping your foot straight so that your toes point up at an angle and so the bottom of your foot can be seen. Repeat for your right foot.   A roll step, also known as a glide step, is a way to march while keeping your instrument level so that it is easier to play.  To march backwards, use the motions of the chair step. Bring each leg up into a chair position, then thrust the foot backwards. Always stay on the balls of your feet and keep your heels off the ground.  Turn 90 degrees to the left, pivoting on the ball of your right foot. To do a right flank, turn 90 degrees to the right and pivot on your left foot.  To perform a horn slide, you will only turn the upper half of your body instead of turning on the ball of your foot. Turn the upper half of your body (along with your horn) 90 degrees right or left, while keeping your legs and feet in the same position, marching in the same direction they were before, if you are marching.   For a lateral slide, do a left or right flank with the lower half of your body, but keep the upper half of your body facing the same direction as it was before.  For percussionists, the crab step will substitute for a slide. To crab step to the left, on the count of 1 sidestep with your left foot over your right, taking about ¾ of a standard sized step. Then sidestep with your right foot, take a slightly larger 1¼ sized step so that you are moving at the same pace as the horn section who is taking standard sized steps each time.  Make a sharp up-and-down motion with your head, which will cause the instrument to move up and down. This will accompany turning movements.  Make a 90 degree turn in 4 counts.  To halt, bring your feet back to the attention positing, beginning the movement with your right foot and ending on your left foot.	Stand at ease. Move to attention. Stand at attention. Hold your head up. Bring your instrument into playing position. Find your position number. Move in equal sized steps. Follow the count. March in an 8-to-5 style. March a chair step. March a rolling step. March backwards. Do a left or right flank. Do a horn slide or a lateral slide. Do a crab step. Do a horn flash. Do a slow turn. Halt.
This simple method ensures the vest will be a good fit without the hassle of measurements, etc.; , Seam allowance is the part that gets folded under when you make the seams. , For each half, fold the t-shirt in half vertically and trace around it, adding seam allowance along the outer edge plus a little extra room for the front-center overlap if desired (e.g., where you'd put snaps or buttons).  Again, add room (1/2 inch) for the seam allowance. Keep in mind the back may have a higher neckline than the front pieces, depending on your design.  Put the cutout pieces together as they would be for the vest, making sure the armholes and hem line up., You'll need at least 1 to 1 1/2 yards for the vest, and an equal amount for the lining.   The lining is the part that goes inside the vest, on the reverse side of the outer cloth. If you have doubts as to how much fabric you need, take your pattern to the fabric or craft store and ask for help. It's always better to have a bit extra material than not enough. You can choose from a wide range of materials for your vest. Keep in mind the season when selecting your fabric; for example, you can use a light wool for autumn, velvet for winter, seersucker for spring, and silk or light cotton for summer.  On a large working surface, lay the fabric out. Place the cutout patterns on top, pinning them together to avoid slippage. Use a pen to trace the outline onto the fabric.  Remove the pattern pieces and use a pen to mark a dotted line around the fabric about 1/2 inch from the edge (your seam allowance). You'll follow this line when you sew up the vest., When you've finished this, check that the lining pieces line up with the vest pieces.  At this point, you are not sewing the lining to the vest, but rather working on the two parts separately.Right sides together (RST) means that the insides of your seam – the parts touching each other – are the right sides of the cloth (the part with the pattern and/or the one that will be seen in the finished product), while the wrong sides are showing outside.At this point, it may be helpful to press the seams flat with an iron if your fabric allows.  Line up the vest and lining pieces, making sure the side seams and shoulder openings match up. Pin them together and sew along all sides except the shoulder seams (the part at the top between the neck and shoulder openings)., At this point, the right side of the fabric should be visible for both liner and vest.  First fold the top 1/2 inch of the back shoulder piece under, then tuck the front piece in. Place a pin at either end of the shoulder seam and sew together on the back piece, about 1/8 inch from the edge. Repeat for the other shoulder seam.  While for some vests this may not be desirable, it adds a crisp finish to more tailored pieces. You can make topstitch with your sewing machine.   For a subtle topstitch, use a regular or lightweight thread that is a similar shade as the fabric. For more contrast, choose a heavier thread and/or a contrasting color. Press the vest before adding topstitch for better accuracy., If you want the option of closing your vest, you'll need to decide how. Buttons and snaps are popular options and easy to add.   Measure where you want your closures to go. You can eyeball the top and bottom closures and then measure and mark precisely where the middle closures should be. Ensure you have the positions marked evenly on both inside edges so that they line up.  Follow the directions for your particular snap plier. First affix the stub to one side, and next the socket to the other.    To make button holes by hand, sew two parallel satin stitches the length of the button and connect them at the top and bottom (these are called bar tacks). Place pins at either end of the hole, just along the bar tacks, and slice open the fabric in between the seams using a seam ripper or small, sharp scissors. Alternatively, your sewing machine might have an attachment for button holes. Lucky you!Sew buttons onto the opposite side of the button holes.	Trace a tank top or a t-shirt (with sleeves tucked in so you can get the arm openings) onto pieces of newspaper or a brown paper bag that's been opened up. Add about 1/2 inch (about 13 mm) around the entire outline for seam allowance. Make the front piece in two halves. Make the back piece by laying the t-shirt flat and tracing along it. Cut out the pattern pieces and inspect. Buy your cloth. Cut out the fabric. Mark the stitching lines on the wrong side (the side you won't see in the finished product). Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for your lining cloth. Using a sewing machine, sew side seams right sides together (RST), vest to vest, lining to lining. Sew the vest and lining fabrics together RST, leaving the shoulder seams open. Turn the fabric inside-out by pulling it through one of the shoulder seams. Pin and sew shoulder seams. Add a row of topstitch 1/8 inch all the way along the edge (optional).A topstitch is a stitch visible from the fabric's right side. Decide on a closure type. Add snaps with a snap plier tool. Add buttons by making button holes and sewing buttons on the opposite side.
Although the often used term "plane spotting" refers to airplanes, the preferred term is "aircraft spotting" because you can observe and record any number of flying craft and not just airplanes. For example, helicopters, gliders, balloons, airships, and microlights can be included if wished.You might want to narrow the choices if you live somewhere that has an incredible amount of air traffic, such as London, Chicago, Frankfurt, etc., or you might want to include a wider range of aircraft if you're living in the middle of empty airspace where aircraft arrivals are not so frequent, such as the country, outback, or the Arctic region. It's really up to your time availability and personal interests.   Start by doing some background research on aircraft spotting websites. There are many sites dedicated to aircraft spotting, from the amateur blog to the professional club-sponsored site, and they can all open up new ideas for your hobby. When searching for online information about aircraft spotting, also use the term "plane spotting", as it is used frequently as well. When looking for information online, also look for airports, aircraft manufacturers, airline information, flight pathways, etc., as these will provide you with a great deal of useful background information. You can limit the search to your own country, or check different sites from all around the world.Keep in mind that aviation photography is a hobby in its own right, and dovetails perfectly with aircraft spotting. So, if anyone questions your interest, you can always justify it by explaining that you are an aviation photography hobbyist as well!; , Although you are free to spot aircraft in any way that pleases you, there are some standard practices that aircraft spotters tend to follow. In order to work out the type of aircraft, there are many indicators that assist the aircraft spotter in working this out. In addition, even where the type of plane is evident, there ares still many other elements worth noting, including country of origin, age, and any special modifications. Things to note as an aircraft spotter include:Noting the type of plane. Its make, size, colors, and country of origin can all be of interest. Noting the plane's registration details. This might enable you to discern the delivery or launch dates of the particular aircraft, depending how much detail you want to go into. Noting any interesting artwork or insignia features on a plane (for example, some airlines like Qantas paint the tail wing, or the whole aircraft, using special artwork from renowned artists on certain planes). For military aircraft, camouflage markings are important and these will differ from country to country. There might also be squadron badges and code letters. Noting engine noise, vapor trails. Placement of wings - is it a monoplane, biplane, or triplane. How are the wings placed in relation to the fuselage, and how much do they sweep rearwards? Is it a recent aircraft, or a vintage model? Noting whether it has retractable wheels or a fixed undercarriage. Or is it a seaplane? Noting the speed. Noting cockpit placement. Noting the landing or take-off pattern of the plane.  Here is your excuse to indulge in good quality gear guaranteed to enhance your aircraft spotting experience. Some items to consider include:   Decent binoculars - for checking out incoming aircraft angles, for noting registration numbers, marks and details, for outdoing your mate at seeing things first, good binoculars are a must. You can also purchase a "spotting scope" instead of binoculars, if preferred.  Digital camera, plus telescope lens, tripod, etc. - for photographic records of the aircraft you have spotted. This is especially important if you are keeping a personal digital album record of your spots, or if you're contributing your spots to a website. Fold-up chair, thermos flask, snack container, rug and warm clothing if cold, sunscreen and hat if hot, snacks and drinks - it's important to be comfortable and to keep well hydrated and fed! Manuals or guides if you want to work out what the aircraft is. You will need to consider both commercial aircraft manuals or guides and military aircraft manuals or guides unless you're not likely to see military aircraft, in which case, only commercial aircraft manuals will be needed. Ask at your local library or look online - some online auction sites can be a good source of such manuals, or sites dedicated to aircraft spotting. A dedicated notebook and decent all-weather pens for writing down the information you glean from spotting. A weatherproof notebook available from camping stores is a good idea. A safety jacket. While not essential, if you are able to spot somewhere that could potential be hazardous for you if you're not seen, consider getting a safety jacket. This might be useful even if your only hazardous element is crossing a very busy main road to get to your spotter's paradise.  It's a lot more fun if you're doing this with someone you know and who appreciates your enthusiasm for aircraft spotting too. If you have a buddy, both of you can chat and set up your own spotting competitions between you. Take walkie-talkies and sit in different locations to see who can spot the registration first. Award yourself points, with the winner or loser shouting a meal or drink after the day's spotting, depending on how you like to play it!  , Initially, it is a good idea to team up with somebody who has already done aircraft spotting so that they can take you to the best places and give you pointers throughout the session. If not, look online, or ask around, to find suitable places to go aircraft spotting. Some airports or aviation associations are very helpful and suggest spotting places for enthusiasts.Always consider safety first. Don't go where you're not allowed. There are strict rules about getting too close to airports, even if they're not fenced off. On the whole, those rules are for your own safety but they're also about security, particularly in more security conscious countries. Set up your spotting area with consideration for existing spotters. If you are somewhere used traditionally for spotting, it's probably not wise to just assume it's OK to sit just anywhere. Ask for advice from the other spotters and they'll usually be very happy to make suggestions for you.  If you've already worked out from the previous steps what you're looking for, then start observing for those elements as you're spotting. Otherwise, you might to ease yourself into the aircraft spotting experience by simply observing everything initially and deciding from this experience which elements interest you most. This is why it can be helpful to have someone already well versed in spotting nearby, to give you hints and guidance so that you don't feel overwhelmed by the initial spotting experience.  While on your outing, you will be taking notes and photos which will need sorting once back home. Plan to set aside some time to tidy up, collate and reference your findings. This might include:   Selecting the best aircraft photos for uploading to a website. Noting significant features or things of interest that you saw during the aircraft spotting exercise. Tallying up the aircraft spotted. Marking down the aircraft you've not spotted before, as well as making notes of aircraft you still would like to be able to check off in the future.  There are many possibilities and some of them may be more appealing than others. For starters, it is a good idea to consider how you feel about the following ideas as forming a part of your hobby, or not, as the case may be:   Competing with other aircraft spotters. This can include joining a club or association and aiming to spot all types of aircraft in a class that is determined by the club or association. Creating your own website and uploading your photos of spots onto it, along with commentary.  Uploading your photos of spots onto one of the many aircraft spotting websites already online. This can be a combination of competition and hobby if wished, or just serve as a source of displaying your photos as wished. If you do this, be sure to keep note of the date, time, and place of your spot, as many sites record the "last spot" of each aircraft as a way of keeping track of the aircraft for all interested viewers. Joining spotting mail lists. There are a number of these that you can join to be kept informed.There are now also Twitter accounts you can follow to keep up with spotting information.Find out if your local club or association, or your favorite aircraft spotting websites, have Twitter accounts that you can follow. Broadening your hobby to include what are "ancillary activities", such as listening to air traffic transmissions (this can be done using radio scanners but only where it is legal to do so). Packing your bags and getting on a plane to go and spot more planes somewhere else in the world. If you have spent time cultivating friendships with other aircraft spotting enthusiasts around the world, this can be a fun and exciting way to make holiday plans and to make new friends. There are plenty of sites dedicated to explaining where the best places for aircraft spotting are to be found around the world. Just be understanding that if you drag along the family though, they're unlikely to want to spend their holiday pursuing your passion, so have something more interesting planned for them! Visiting aviation museums around the world. This can also be adding to your aircraft spotting records, as you check off vintage and famous aircraft from different parts of the world.  A hobby is always a lot more fun when you share it with other like-minded enthusiasts and being part of an excited and active group is a great way to give real life to your hobby experience. For example, you can join the LAAS International as an aircraft enthusiast. , As your hobby continues, if you notice anything that you believe should be passed on to airport officials, then be helpful and do so. This doesn't mean being a nuisance and trying to suppose you know their job better than they do, but some things that could be helpful include:   Alerting airport officials if you notice any bird nesting or animal breeding activities near the airport or on it. Birds and animals can be a hazard for aircraft and it's a good idea to let airport officials know in case they haven't realized. Alerting airport officials if you notice any strange activities, or security breaches such as broken fences, etc. Don't be a vigilante though - just things that might be out of the ordinary. For example, in the UK there is a code of conduct in place for aircraft spotters introduced by aviation enthusiasts' club LAAS International, under which aircraft spotters are encouraged to report suspicious behavior.	Make a decision as to the extent of aircraft that you might like to "spot". Understand what is usually involved in aircraft spotting. Get some good gear. Take a buddy. Prepare yourself for an aircraft spotting trip. Start spotting. Record your experiences once back at home. Decide how far you want to take your new hobby. Consider joining a club or association that supports and promotes aircraft spotting. Be useful.
Arrange your tools on a clean flat surface and have all your tools at hand. Make sure you have enough space to move around as well as keeping your soldering iron at a safe distance while not in use.   Make sure you have the Dream Lite on hand, too!; , Remove all three batteries before moving forward.  Starting at the corners, pull up until you hear the top cover pop, continue to the next corner (start going long ways) and then pull up on the middle. The other side will come off with greater ease once the first side is done.   This does take a bit of muscle; don't be afraid to strong arm it, just be mindful of your fingernails. Here's what it should look like without the cover.  Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the two screws that are securing the board to the casing.   You will now be able to move the board around but be careful as some of the wires are short and won't allow you to twist too far.  D1 is the amber LED, D2 is the green LED, and D3 is the blue LED.   This tutorial shows replacement of the blue LED (D3). You can even change up the colors to suit your child's taste.  Place locking pliers (regular pliers will work but you will need to keep your grip) around the bulb you want to remove keeping it as close to the board as possible. You can use this to not only hold your board still but the added pressure will help pull the bulb out as you use your soldering iron to loosen it.  Using the pliers to hold the bulb and board, carefully use the soldering iron to melt the solder around the two pins for that specific LED bulb. This may take some back-and-forth moving between the pins––do not hold the iron against the board or keep it on the solder too long or you may damage the board this way. Going back and forth will help keep the heat down.   You can use small nail clippers to trim some of the solder and pin away before using the soldering iron. This can help cut down the amount of time needed to loosen the bulb; doing this is optional.    Depending on the style of LED bulb you are using, you may have to trim the pins. Trim just above the little squares using wire cutters or nail clippers. If you want to test the bulb before doing anything and have a flat 3v battery at hand, place the bulb with one pin on each side as shown in the photo. Make sure the positive pin is on the positive side. If it doesn't light, try flipping the bulb around.  Each bulb has a positive and negative pin. In order for it to work, you must make sure you are placing the new bulb on the board correctly. To find the positive and negative pin, look at the inside of the bulb. The positive pin will have the least amount of metal inside and the negative pin will have the most.  You can use them to slide the new bulb into. One of the openings will have + above it. Make sure to place the positive pin into that hole.  Using electrical tape, secure the new bulb onto the board to keep it in place while soldering.   If you make the strip of tape long enough, you can then secure the board to part of the casing. This will help keep your hands free to use the soldering iron and solder.  Using a small amount of solder, secure the pins to the board being careful to not press the iron against the board for too long. Use as little solder as possible to keep the board clean.  Replace the batteries and turn on the Dream Lite. Go through all of the settings to make sure the bulb is bright enough and dims with the rotate setting.  Screw the board back in once you have verified everything is working.  Pop the top of the casing back on. Again, this takes a bit of muscle. Start with the corners first and then the middle. Revel in your newfound skills!	Prepare. Remove the batteries. Remove the top cover. Unscrew the board. Take this time to examine which bulb you need to remove. Secure the dim/dead LED. Remove the bulb. Prepare the new bulb. Find the positive pin. Find the 2 small openings on the board. Secure the new bulb. Solder the new bulb. Test the bulb. Remove the batteries. Replace the top.
Learn it thoroughly with careful attention to establishing consistent fingerings, dynamics, articulation, and any repeats.   Once you're familiar with your piece, memorize it. Memorize measure by measure or line by line. Even after you've learned and memorized it, continue to practice diligently at slow tempos to fix any new problems that develop. Practice with the understanding that you won't be able to make changes at the last minute, and your performance will sound much like your practice.; , If your piano is at home, play for your family and guests. Find pianos in public places and play your piece for passersby.   If you practice in a music school, play for other students. Evaluate each performance for its good and bad moments, and develop a plan for fixing the mistakes.  Pick out the clothes you'll be wearing and make sure they don't restrict your movement or look awkward when you play. Knowing you look great gives you one less thing to worry about on the day of the recital.  On the day of the recital, play your piece slowly with the music. Pay attention to troublesome spots, but understand that it's too late to make major changes. Once you've looked over your piece, play something that you love to play, gets you excited about sharing your music with others, or relaxes you.  If possible, test out the instrument you'll be performing on. Evaluate its soft and loud dynamics, tonal control, relative loudness of the octaves, and pedals. You should arrive early even if you're not able to play on the performance instrument: few things contribute to performance anxiety like arriving to your recital late.  Be confident in your thorough preparation. The green room is no place to change fingerings or correct memory slips, so reassure yourself that you have it down. If you feel the need, review the score and play the piece in your head, but not more than once.  As you do, smile at the audience and think to yourself, "I have prepared my piece and I feel confident!" Roll the bench up or down to the proper height for you, and take your time to get it right. Once you're done, put your hands in your lap and vividly imagine the beginning of your piece, paying attention to tempo, tone, volume, and the sensation of playing the first notes.  Immerse yourself in the music. Enjoy the audience's captivation. Revel in sharing your hard work.	Prepare your piece. Perform your piece in low-pressure settings. Do a dress rehearsal. Warm up. Arrive early. Stay calm backstage. Step onto the stage confidently. Forget about everything.
You do not want the car to roll or sink once you have it jacked up.  It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.  Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:   Your service manual will recommend jacking points The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack, or trolley jack. If you are unsure how to use one visit Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack. You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. A good tutorial on jack stands can be found at Use Jack Stands. If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.  At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. If you are uncomfortable removing a wheel, read about how to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires.  You can use a small kiddie pool, bathtub, or any other container large enough to hold the tire. You should add water until the tire is completely submerged and then allow the water to settle.  Once the water has settled you might notice air bubbles escaping from the tire. If so, you have found your leak.	Pull the car onto level, solid ground. Loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench (tire iron) or impact wrench. Jack up the car. Remove the wheel. Submerge the tire in water. Watch for air bubbles.
; , It should reach about 1 inch (2.5cm) in height.  Shorten the stems of the leaves if they're longer than 1 1/2 inches (3.27cm). , Do this very slowly and with care not to cause folds in the leaves. There should be enough silica gel to cover the leaves.  Add the container of leaves and silica.  Initially microwave for 1 minute, then check and try another minute. You are looking for the leaves to have dried, which will take about 2-3 minutes.  Pour the silica gel into another container, slowly and carefully. Any silica still on the leaves can be brushed off with your fingers or a paintbrush or other suitable small soft brush.  This step is optional but it will help prolong the life of the preserved leaves by strengthening them. Follow the instructions on the packaging.  You can include the silica-preserved leaves in floral arrangements, artwork, craft projects, and as decoration on wrapping, cards, and pictures, etc.	Place the microwave-safe container on a flat work surface, such as the kitchen table. Pour the silica gel into the container so that it covers the base of the container. Prepare the leaves. Arrange the leaves across the surface of the silica in the container.  , Pour in more silica gel over the top of the leaves sitting on the other silica gel. Put the glass of water into the microwave. Microwave the container on medium power. Remove the container from the microwave. Spray glaze or dried flower coating over the leaves. Use the leaves.
It is usually a light colored reservoir with a black cap and is usually is inline with your brake pedal in the engine compartment.; , Using a clean turkey baster, suck out as much of the old, inky fluid as you can.  After you've gotten all the old brake fluid out, clean any sediment out of the reservoir, if accessible, with a clean, lint-free rag. Do not spill any brake fluid on any painted surfaces, it will remove the paint almost immediately. Clean up any spilled fluid with a brake clean fluid or soap and water.  Replace the top of the master cylinder reservoir. , Using a box-end wrench (often 5/16") that fits the bleeder bolt, loosen the bleeder valves, but leave them closed. A little oil drizzled or sprayed on the bolts the day before will help to loosen them.  Using a piece of clear plastic tubing (aquarium tubing works fine), push one end of the tube over the brake bleeder bolt.   Put the other end of the tube into a small, clear bottle with an inch or two of clean brake fluid in it. (This will keep air from being sucked back into the brake cylinder or lines.)  , This will prevent the pedal from traveling too close to the floor and you begin to bleed the brakes. This is needed so you do not bottom out pistons in the master cylinder and causing internal master cylinder leakage.  Remove the top of the master cylinder reservoir and top off the master cylinder reservoir with fresh fluid. Keep the master cylinder full during process otherwise air might get into system. , The helper should shout "down" when the pedal is down as far as it will go.    Note: Not too much force is needed. Press down as much as you would to fully come to a halt before a stop sign.  Old fluid and air will go down the tubing into the bottle. When the fluid stops, close the bleeder valve.    Note: Warn your helper that the brake pedal he or she is pressing down on will sink down as you unlock the bleeder bolt a quarter turn. This is perfectly natural and your helper should keep pressure and follow pedal down until it stops and hold it down. , After every five times the brake pedal is depressed, top off the master cylinder reservoir with fresh fluid. Never let the reservoir get too low, or air will be sucked into the master cylinder. ,,,, Your brakes have been properly bled. Thank your helper by buying him or her a beer or cream soda. Never take your help for granted.	Remove the top of the master cylinder reservoir. Draw out the old fluid. Clean the reservoir. Fill the master cylinder with clean brake fluid. Pump the brake pedal several times (15 or more).  , Loosen the bleeder valves. Hook a tube to the bleeder bolt. Put a piece of 1 x 4 lumber or some other "spacer" under the brake pedal. Refill the master cylinder reservoir.

Use a tape measure to measure the wrist of the future owner. After making your measurements add two or three inches to the measurements. The extra amount is for adjustments and leeway for braiding., Measure out the tape based off the lengths you took down. Cut out three strips of duct tape that are equal lengths. You can use different colors that complement each other for a flashy accessory., Fold each strip of duct tape lengthwise. Fold the adhesive into itself so that there isn’t any sticky side of the tape leftover. Attach each folded strip together using tape or a binder clip at one end of the tape., Start by laying each strip side by side. Wrap the leftmost strip over the rest of the strips. Wrap the rightmost strip up and over the left strip. Now wrap the center strip over the rightmost strip. Wrap the leftmost strip around the center. Continue this pattern until you reach the end of the bracelet., Finish up the bracelet by taping or stapling the other end of the braid. Wrap the bracelet around the wearer’s wrist and then tape the two ends together. Ensure that the bracelet is not too tight.	Create the measurements. Cut your duct tape. Fold and connect your strips. Braid the strips. Secure the braid.
This is a contract between a seller and a buyer. The seller agrees to sell a commodity in the future at a price upon which they agree today. The seller agrees to deliver this asset in the future, and the buyer agrees to purchase the asset in the future. No physical exchange takes place until the specified future date. This contract must be accounted for now, when it is signed, and again on the date when the physical exchange takes place.For example, suppose a seller agrees to sell grain to a buyer in 3 months for $12,000, but the current value of the grain is only $10,000. In one year, when the exchange takes place, the market value of the grain is $11,000, so in the end, the seller makes a profit of $1,000 on the sale. The spot rate, or current value, of the grain is $10,000. The forward rate, or future value, of the grain is $12,000.; , On the liability side of the equation, you would credit the Asset Obligation for the spot rate. Then, on the asset side of the equation, you would debit the Asset Receivable for the forward rate. Finally, debit or credit the Contra-Asset Account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. You would debit, or decrease the Contra- Asset Account for a discount and credit, or increase it for a premium.Using the example above, the seller would credit the Asset Obligation account for $10,000. He has made a commitment to sell his grain today, and today it is worth $10,000. But, he is going to receive $12,000 for the grain. So he debits Assets Receivable for $12,000. This is what he’s going to be paid. To account for the $2,000 premium, he credits the Contra-Asset Account for $2,000.  On the liability side of the equation, you would credit Contracts Payable in the amount of the forward rate. Then you would record the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate as a debit or credit to the Contra-Assets Account. On the asset side of the equation, you would debit Assets Receivable for the spot rate.Using the example above, the buyer would credit Contracts Payable in the amount of $12,000. Then he would debit the Contra-Assets Account for $2,000 to account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. Then he would debit Assets Receivable for $10,000.  First, you close out your asset and liability accounts. On the liability side, debit Asset Obligations by the spot value on the contract date. On the asset side, credit Contracts Receivable by the forward rate, and debit or credit the Contra-Assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate.Using the above example, on the liability side you would debit Asset Obligations by $10,000. On the asset side, you would credit Contracts Receivable by $12,000/ Then you would debit the Contra-Asset account by $2,000, the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate.  Determine the current market value of the commodity. This is its value on the date of the physical exchange between the buyer and seller. Next, debit, or increase, your cash account by the forward rate. Then credit, or decrease, your Asset account by the current market value of the commodity. Finally, recognize the gain or loss, which is the difference between the forward rate and the current market value, with a debit or credit on the Asset Account.In the example above the current market value of the grain on the date of the physical exchange is $11,000. First, the seller must increase cash based on the contracted amount, so he would debit cash by $12,000. Next he must reduce the Asset account by the current market value by recording a credit of $11,000. Then, to recognize the gain of $1,000 (which is the current value, $11,000, less the spot rate, $10,000), he would record a credit on the Asset Account of $1,000.  First, you close out your asset and liability accounts. On the liability side, debit Contracts Payable by the forward rate, and debit or credit the Contra-Assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. On the asset side, credit Assets Receivable by the spot rate on the date of the contract.Using the example above, on the liability side, the buyer would debit Contracts Payable by $12,000 and credit the Contra-Asset Account by $2,000. On the asset side, he would credit Assets Receivable by $10,000.  Decrease, or credit the Cash account by the amount of the forward rate. Then, record the difference between the forward rate and the current market value as an additional credit or debit to the Cash account. Finally, increase, or debit, the Asset account by the current market value of the commodity.In the above example, the buyer would debit Cash by $12,000. The difference between the market value, $11,000, and the forward rate $12,000, is $1,000. They buyer lost $1,000, so he would record a debit to Cash of $1,000. Next, he would debit the Asset account by $11,000.  A forward contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to deliver a commodity on a future date for a specified price. The value of the commodity on that future date is calculated using rational assumptions about rates of exchange. Farmers use forward contracts to eliminate risk for falling grain prices.Forward contracts are also used in transactions using foreign exchange in an effort to reduce the risk of losses due to changes in the exchange rates., A derivative is a security with a price that is based upon, or derived, from something else. Forward contracts are considered derivative financial instruments because the future value of the commodity is derived from other information about the commodity.The future value of the commodity for the forward contract is derived from the current market value, or spot price, and the risk-free rate of return.  In investing, hedging means minimizing risk. In forward contracts, buyers and sellers attempt to minimize risk of losses by locking in prices for commodities in advance. Buyers lock in a price in hopes that they will end up paying less than the current market value of a commodity. Sellers hedge their risks with forward contracts in an attempt to protect themselves from falling prices., The party agreeing to purchase the commodity assumes the long position. The party agreeing to sell the commodity is assuming the short position.The buyer, who is in the long position, is the person who stands to benefit if the price of the commodity rises higher than expected. The seller, who is in the short position, stands to lose if the price of the commodity rises.  The spot value and the forward value are both quotes for the rate at which the commodity will be bought or sold. The difference between the two has to do with the timing of the settlement and delivery of the commodity. Both parties in a forward contract need to know both values in order to accurately account for the forward contract.]   The spot rate is the current market value for the asset in question. It is the value of the commodity if it were sold today. For example, a farmer selling grain for the spot value agrees to sell it immediately for the current price.The forward rate is the agreed-upon future price in the contract. For example, suppose the farmer in the above example wants to enter into a forward contract in an effort to hedge against falling grain prices. He can agree to sell his grain to another party in six months at agreed-upon forward rate. When the time comes to sell, the grain will be sold for the agreed-upon forward rate, despite fluctuations that occur in the spot rate during the intervening six months., The spot rate can be used to determine the forward rate. This is because a commodity’s future value is based in part on its current value. The other factor that is used to determine the forward value is the risk-free rate.The risk-free rate is the rate at which the commodity is expected to change in value with zero risk. It is usually based on the current interest rate of a three-month U.S. Treasury bill, which is considered the safest investment you can make.	Recognize a forward contract. Record a forward contract on the contract date on the balance sheet from the seller’s perspective. Record a forward contract on the contract date on the balance sheet from the buyer’s perspective. Record a forward contract on the balance sheet from the seller’s perspective on the date the commodity is exchanged. Recognize any gain or loss on the commodity sold from the seller’s perspective. Record a forward contract on the balance sheet from the buyer’s perspective on the date the commodity is exchanged. Recognize any gain or loss on the commodity sold from the buyer’s perspective. Understand the definition of a forward contract. Learn the meaning of derivatives. Learn the meaning of hedging. Know the difference between the long position and the short position. Know the difference between the spot value and the forward value. Understand the relationship between the spot value and the forward value.
A wet/dry vacuum such as a Shop-Vac is a powerful and handy machine that can handle different types of vacuuming jobs. They usually have a long hose or nozzle and a long cord, which makes it easier to vacuum out a car.   Alternately, use a coin-operated vacuum at car wash. These also have long nozzles, but they require that you feed coins into a timed meter, which can interrupt your cleaning progress. There are small handheld, portable vacuums that you can also use. These are usually good for spot cleaning but do not tend to have enough suction power to adequately vacuum out a car.  Most vacuums have plastic attachments, which are superior to metal attachments. With metal, you run the risk of scratching your car or upholstery, particularly if you have leather or vinyl seats.Useful attachments are brushes with a wide square opening and a skinny, narrow attachment that can reach into crevices.  When vacuuming a vehicle, make sure you are getting into all the crevices and cracks to suck up dirt and dust. Recline the seats to get at the inside crease of the seat. Move the seats forward to get underneath the seats.   Take out child car seats as well, so that you are sure to get underneath these, which tend to gather cereal, granola bars and crayons.  Vacuum the upholstery on the floor by getting underneath the floor mats. This will also make it easier to deep-clean the floor mats.  Removing dirt and debris from your car will prevent them from becoming ground into the seats and the carpet, thereby contributing to hard-to-remove stains. Set a schedule for yourself to vacuum out your car at least once a month, or more frequently if your car gets dirty quickly.	Use a wet/dry vacuum. Use plastic vacuum attachments. Move the seats. Take out floor mats. Vacuum frequently.
Contact the corporate headquarters of your local theaters. Some viewers are allowed free movies in exchange for rating the quality of service, choice of movies, customer service, and, in some cases even the quality and selection of the snacks.  Once you are on the inside, sit back and enjoy (after your shift is over, of course)! This is probably your best option for being able to see free movies on a regular basis. Just be aware that you are at work, not vacation, and keep that popcorn flowing.  This takes a bit of skill and training, and a bit of luck. But writing for a small paper or website will get you a seat for almost every movie that comes to town.   Be aware that jobs in this area are often very competitive, and even in small communities you will need to have a degree in journalism or communications before most papers will even consider you. Contrary to popular opinion, becoming a paid critic is difficult work. If you're having trouble breaking into the traditional media outlets, try starting your own movie blog, and start reviewing movies on your own. You'll have to pay at first, but if you provide quality content and earn a lot of followers, you may have some leverage in getting into more and more movies for free.	Call theater management. Get a job at a movie theater. Become a film critic.
This knight does not carry the GBE or KBE appendage. This title is for men only, and is appended John Jones, kt. This is known as the Knights Bachelor and is the most junior of the order for men. It is the lowest rank of the knighted male. A woman given this honor will actually carry the Dame Jane Jones, DBE title, Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, because this is the most junior of the order for women., For religious organizations such as the Knights of Columbus, they even say "serve the Lord, get a sword" (and then they offer you pretty epic insurance.) Besides the KofC, there are a surpringly large number of organizations that feature “Knight” in their names or as a title that can be earned by rising through the organization’s ranks.  It’s possible to gain the title of “knight” simply by paying a membership fee in some organizations or signing up for a reward program that includes the title “knight.”  , Some social organizations, such as the International Fellowship of Chivalry-Now, devote themselves to fostering the ideals of chivalrous behavior in their daily lives, as opposed to having their members to dress in armor and swing maces at each other.	Earn the title through life achievement. Join a religious or civic organization. Buy the title. Join an organization that promotes the ideals of chivalry in the modern world.
Usually the tension will be written in a box on the pattern.; , This ensures that the item will be of the correct size and appearance, rather than sloppy, lopsided, or misshapen. This will also prevent kitten-sized sweaters or refrigerator-size socks!  , This will show any problems before it is too late. For example, if the tension square is smaller than the one specified, then your needles are too small and you must find thicker needles. Equally, if your tension square is larger than the one specified, your needles are too large and you will need to replace with thinner ones.	Note that every pattern has the specific tension instructions. Always work to the correct tension specified. Always knit a tension square for practice before starting your project.
Most animals that are sneaking into your garden are doing so because they can smell the vegetables and are attracted by the free meal. Scents can also be used to keep animals out, sending a message that your garden is either not a safe place to eat or by making it smell unappealing. Take a look at the two main types of scent deterrents to help you pick one for your garden:You can buy animal repellents that smell like the urine of a predator. These repellents will make your garden seem dangerous to animals. You'll likely need to know which type of animal is invading your garden before buying a predator scent that scares that specific animal. You might try using spicy or unappealing sprays around your garden. These sprays can make animals uncomfortable or make your garden taste and smell bad enough that they will look for food elsewhere. Animal repelling sprays can be bought at most home or garden stores. You can try looking up homemade animal repellent recipes and make your own. Many sprays will need to be applied often, as rain or moisture will wash them away.  If you know the type of animal that is regularly invading your garden, you can try growing some plants that they would find repulsive. Adding plants that common garden pests dislike can help keep them out and protect your vegetables. Take a look at some of the following plants that are thought to keep away garden pests:Azalea, boxwood, lamb's ear, peony and marigolds are all unappealing to rabbits. Bleeding hearts, daffodils, hyssop, and mullein are plants that can repel deer. You can try mixing some of these plants in with your garden to make the whole thing look unappealing. Planting these barrier plants along the parameter of your garden can help repel pests.  Even though your garden is a peaceful place, the animals that are sneaking in will still be on the look out for threats. Because of this, you can add devices to your garden that are designed to startle and scare off whatever animal might be nibbling your vegetables. Take a look at some of these ideas to give you an idea of how you can make your garden a scary place to unwanted animals:Modern scarecrows come equipped with motion sensors and will spray water at any invading wildlife. Having an outdoor dog can help keep many animals out of your garden. Some repellents make use of shiny or reflective material to frighten off birds. You can buy electronic repellents that sound an alarm or play a frightening sound when they detect motion.  Cats are naturally inclined to hunt and can do a great job of keeping small animals out of your garden. Besides actually hunting the animals that make it into your garden, your cat's scent and presence may scare off future pests. So if you have an outdoor cat, consider introducing them to your garden to help cut down on the amount animals snack on your vegetables.Make sure your cat has all of its vaccines as many wild animals can carry diseases. Always monitor your cat to make sure they are in good health and are capable of safely going outdoors.  It might seem counterintuitive, but adding plants near your garden that animals love can be a good way to keep them out of your actual garden. Once you know which animals are causing you trouble, you can try planting their favorite foods away from your garden, keeping them out and sparing your vegetables.   Make sure any attractive plants are placed away from your garden. Making an animal's favorite foods easy to get to will prevent them from trying to gain access to your garden. Try planting some extra vegetables in an area that is easy for pests to get at, keeping them away from the ones you plan on eating.  Certain environments and landscapes will make animals feel more or less comfortable. Depending on how you've landscaped your garden or yard, you may actually be making animals feel right at home. Rearranging your landscaping can be a simple way to help make animals uncomfortable and keep them out of your garden. Try keeping some of these tips in mind when landscaping your garden to help scare off would be invaders: Avoid having lots of weeds or heavy plant cover, as most animals enjoy feeling hidden in the foliage. Get rid of woodpiles that may be near the garden. Cut down or move bushes or shrubs that surround the garden.	Apply sprays around your garden. Include plants that animals find repulsive in your garden. Scare away unwanted animals. Let your cat help keep small animals away. Include sacrificial plants near your garden. Use landscaping to make animals feel unwelcome.
If you don't have a serger, you have a few other options. These include:          Hand-finishing the edges with a blanket stitch or whip stitch. Finishing the edges with a decorative sewing machine stitch. Crocheting around the edge of the blanket as suggested by the Linus Project. Use a skip-stitch blade on a rotary cutter to create evenly spaced holes around the blanket's edge. Place a crochet hook through each hole, in turn. Draw the yarn through the hole toward you, perform a single crochet and chain one. Repeat.	Finish the edge of your fleece blanket with a serger.
Drum corps are relatively exclusive when it comes to instrumentation- no woodwinds of any sort are allowed to march, including all variety of saxophone. In the brass family, the DCI and DCA (more on them later) both have rules only allowing bell-front valved brass instruments into drum corps. That means trombonists, French horn players, and Sousaphone players will want to learn trumpet, mellophone, baritone/euphonium, or contrabass/tuba. Percussion instruments offered generally shift from corps to corps, depending on their style or show each year.; , Drum corps is a world with a different vocabulary than that of the rest of the world. Some of the more commonly used terms are listed here.   DCI is short for Drum Corps International, which is in charge of junior drum corps. Junior drum corps are drum corps that allow members between the ages of 13 to 21, though they may be more exclusive if they chose. DCA stands for Drum Corps Associates, and is in charge of all-age drum and bugle corps. While not as popular as DCI drum corps, all-age corps are starting to be more popular. "Phantom" style is a reference to The Phantom Regiment's marching style, which is unique. You may hear any other corps name inserted, though, as nearly all corps have their own unique style. Spirit, for example, has a "rolling walk" style, while Cavaliers have a "high walk" of sort, and Phantom has a "sharp" style. World class/open class/international class are the different classes of drum corps as of 2008. World class corps have exactly 150 members, while open class corps has 30-150 members. International class is the class for corps based in countries outside of North America that wish to tour the DCI circuit. "Contra" normally refers to the contra-bass, which is the tuba of drum and bugle corps. They look rather like very large baritones, slung over one shoulder, as seen in this picture.  Since practice schedules are often extremely difficult to follow, but time commitment is a huge part of making a corps, when looking into joining a corps, look at the local ones first. You may be surprised what isn't that far away- in 2008, there were 24 different drum corps in the World Class of DCI alone, almost all from different states.  Currently, in DCI, at least, there are no corps that are female-only, however, the Cavaliers and the Madison Scouts are male-only corps. In other countries, female-only corps are, while not common, existent, at least.  In today's global economy, fees may be the deciding factor between you marching in a corps, and you just watching the show from the stands. If you have financial problems, but are talented, some corps offers scholarships to help with dues. After you've marched a year or two of corps, though, it's much easier to get money for marching.  Regardless of what corps you decide on, when the audition weekend is, how your marching, playing, or attitude is, if you're even considering getting into corps, you must be in shape. You're not looking to build that much muscle mass, though, so standard workouts may not be exactly what you need. You should be looking to be lightweight, true, but quick and nimble. Running, biking, and swimming all help out with this without weighing you down with extra muscle mass. Push-ups and crunches are also recommended, as they will help you build the endurance you will need to survive drum and bugle corps.  Drum corps schedules are demanding, to say the least, and there is very little room for error when first going out for a corps. People understand, though, that everyone has lives outside of drum corps. As long as you are upfront and clear about any conflicts in your schedule, and they don't conflict too often, of course, you can normally have a bit of "wiggle room", though that really depends on the corps most of all.  Also, look into what else the audition exactly entails. A standard audition for drum corps includes prepared pieces of some sort, a piece of your own, sight reading, basic marching skills, and a section in which you have to march and play at the same time. It's obviously best to practice as many of these things as possible, especially if you are particularly weak in any of these areas. Range, lip setting, dynamic ability, posture, and tone are all major factors for brass players. Keep in mind, meanwhile, that many drum corps also judge attitude! Be positive, polite, and don't make excuses for yourself.  Each corp, as previously mentioned, has their own style. You don't have to know this prior to auditioning, as the instructors will teach it later, but it can't hurt to be one step ahead.  Make sure that, a week or two prior, you registered for the audition, if that was required, and paid any audition fees. Instrumentalists should bring their instrument to the first camp (normally corps-owned instruments aren't distributed until at least the second weekend), a folding music stand, their music, and any oils, tuners, metronomes, etc. that may be needed for the weekend.  At this point, there's nothing that should be said. If you have practiced enough, have the talent and ability, and just a bit of luck, you should do just fine. If not, there's always next year!	Make sure your instrument is allowed in a drum corps. Learn the terminology. Look into (relatively) local corps first. Notice gender-specific corps. Look into dues once you've found a corps you're interested in. Get into shape. Check your calendar. Find the audition music/routine. Look into the corps marching style. Show up on the audition weekend, prepared. Audition.
You'll need to draw a system of squares that will end up "inscribing" the spiral, acting as guide lines for your drawing. Gather your materials, making sure that you have everything––the list of what is needed is found in the Things You'll Need section below all the steps.; , This works by adding the two previous numbers: You get the next one starting from 0 and 1; so, it goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. The length of one side of each square should equal a number in the sequence (the 0 is not needed for drawing any of the square), but the beginning point can be called (0,0), if we set it up that way. You will have a 1X1 square (use any unit of measurement you want, at any size, just be consistent) with a second 1X1 drawn next to it on the left side of the first, then down to put 2X2, and right for 3X3, then up for 5X5, and then left to fit 8X8. Below all that, put 13X13 and so on, to as large a square as your paper can fit.  Draw each of these squares in a counter-clockwise pattern. It will finally form a spiral as you draw a curve through the squares (as instructed later).  Put your compass, pivot point and pencil, as shown in the picture, with its length set at one unit (side of the first square) long. Turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  Adjust the compass so it is now two units long. Again, turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Then 3, then 5, next 8 and continue this process until the squares each have the curving spiral through them.  Ink your drawing with pen when you are ready, carefully tracing along the penciled curve. If you're shooting for exceptional accuracy, you can use a French curve to help you.  With the spiral traced in pen, use your eraser to rub out the squares made in pencil.  Congratulations, you've just made the golden spiral!	Gather your materials. Draw squares using the Fibonacci sequence. Arrange the squares. Turn the compass. Adjust the compass. Ink your spiral. Erase your guide lines. Done!
Duct tape is available in all sorts of colors and patterns, so choose some pretty, brightly colored ones to make your bow with. A good idea is to pick one color for the main part of your bow and another, contrasting color for the centerpiece.; , Use a pair of sharp scissors to do this. The six inch pieces will make a pretty large bow, so if you'd prefer a smaller one, cut out two 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces instead.  Do this slowly and carefully to make sure the two pieces are exactly aligned. However, if you make a mistake, you can use your scissors to trim any extra bits off the edges. Try to make sure that there aren't any wrinkles and the bow will look better at the end!   At this point, you can feel free to decorate your strip of duct tape with any additional details, using markers or glitter pens.  Fold the strip of duct tape three ways, going in opposite directions each time, as if you were making a fan.  Pinch the middle of the folded duct tape between your fingers and wrap a thin strip (about 0.25 inches in width) of the other colored duct tape around the center, to secure. Make sure to keep your fingers out of the way or making a duct tape bow could turn into a sticky situation!  , Once you have made the bow, you can stick it to whatever you like. One easy idea is to stick a bobby pin through the back of the wrapped piece of tape. Now you have a beautiful, customized bow to wear whenever you want! Alternatively, you could try attaching the bow to a headband or pinning it to a schoolbag or handbag.	Get some colored duct tape. Cut two 6 inch (15.2 cm) strips of duct tape. Line up the two pieces of tape and stick the sticky sides to each other. Fold the strip three ways. Tape the center of the bow. Attach the bow to something. Finished.
If you're a serious guitar player you'll be changing your strings frequently, and some musicians change weekly. If your strings feel slow and sticky, or you have to re-tune frequently, you're due for new strings. If you haven't restrung in 3-4 months, get new strings.          If you're about to play a big gig, change the strings that morning to prevent unexpected breaking.; , If you're new to tuning, you want to have a good sense of how the guitar should look. Take a picture of the strings, or simply look up a picture of your guitar online. While it isn't complicated, you want a good sense of how the guitar is strung before beginning.         Though it is rare, some guitars have special holes or winding patterns near the strings. Don't cut the strings off without take a quick look at everything.  Turn the tuning machine or peg to loosen each string enough that you can unwind the string and pull it out but hand. You'll know you're loosening if, when plucked, the string sounds deeper. While you can also cut your strings off, this method eases tension gradually and, in the worst case scenario, you can reuse an old string if one breaks while restringing.          If you're a beginner, just loosen one string at a time. Then replace it and repeat with the next string. Once loose, you can unwind the string off the tuning peg and free it from the neck of the guitar., On a regular bridge, like a Fender Strat or any other string-through guitar, just pull the strings out of the back of the guitar's body. To make it easier, carefully push the strings through, providing some slack and making them easier to grip. Grab the string by the small, donut-shaped metal end and slowly pull it through the guitar.          Most guitars are strung in a simple, straightforward manner, so just follow the string through the guitar to remove it. Do not yank the strings out. Protect your guitar by taking your time. If you have a wrap-around bridge, you will be able to pull them out of the underside of the bridge. Wrap-arounds started out as Toms when players like ZZ Top wrapped the strings around the tailpiece to give the string height a low profile without any buzz., Use this time to remove all of the dust, grime, and dirt from the neck of your guitar. This will make the guitar look good, protect the new strings, and actually make your guitar feel a little faster. For deeper cleaning, purchase a bottle of fret-cleaner from your local music shop.  95% of the time you should get the "regular weight," or "lite" strings. While some guitarists use heavier gauges or odd string configurations, you can't simply grab a set of strings if your guitar is not made for it. Strings that are too heavy for your guitar can warp or bend the neck without the proper adjustments, so stick to regulars until you know more about your guitar.          In general, you want your high E to be a ".008-.0011" thickness. This is for medium, lite, and extra lite strings. If you use drop tunings, like a drop D, you might want heavier strings. Ask your music store staff for a specific recommendation., Give yourself plenty of room to work, laying the guitar down on a table so that you can adjust it comfortably. Make sure to place a towel or blanket underneath to prevent scuffing or scratching. Some people like resting the head off the edge to make tuning easier.  This hole should point away from the string so that it is parallel to one of the frets. If you were holding the guitar and playing it, the hole would be pointing up.  Thread it from the inside of the guitar out. In general, most guitarists will begin with their heaviest string, the top E. It will often me marked as "6th string," or by the highest gauge number (usually around .050). Slide it in the opposite way you took the other strings out, then run it through the hole in the tuning peg, pulling the string away from the guitar. Make sure you leave 2-3 inches of slack, as well -- you don't want the string to be taut before you even start tightening.          The tuning pegs aren't marked, but you should just replace the strings in the same order you took them out. On most electric guitars, the first peg is for the top string, then each one further towards the tip of the head is for a string further down., Try not to overthink this. Simply grab both sides tightly, then turn your hands clockwise to crimp both sides of the string along the tuning post. If you pulled the string out, it would look like the "S" in the Van Halen logo.          Your right hand will be coming towards your body, away from the guitar. Your left hand will be pushing up, in towards the other tuning pegs.  Take the end of the string and pull it under the other side of the string (the side being fed into the tuning post). After you go underneath the string, bring the end back over the top and pull it taut, pulling towards the very tip of the guitar. You're basically creating a loop with the end of the string around the rest of the string.          You'll have a small coiled bit of string right where the string meets the tuning peg.  Place your index finger on the string 1-2" before it meets the tuning peg. You don't want to pin it, just hold it down. Then you can turn your tuner slowly counter-clockwise. Make sure that your string is winding around the peg in a uniform manner.          Use a tuner to slowly get yourself up to the proper tension. When in doubt, try not to over-tighten -- this causes strings to break.  Once you've got the first one done, repeat the process on the rest of the strings, working through the packet. Remember to clean the fretboard after removing a string, to leave some slack in the string before tightening, and to crimp the string in place before starting to turn.          If your head has a 3x3 set-up, remember that the lower set of tuning pegs must be turned in reverse. Simply repeat the proceeding instructions, replacing left with right and up with down.  Use wire cutters to remove the excess string at the end, though you may want to leave 1/2" or so to allow deeper tunings, if you desire.  As the strings get used to the tension, they slowly stretch. This only occurs for the first 1-2 days, and can be avoided by regular, constant tuning as you put the strings on.	Change your strings when they are rusty, gummy, or falling out of tune quickly. Note the path of each string before removing it. Loosen the old strings by down-tuning. Remove the strings from the bridge. Clean your unstrung guitar with a lint-free cloth. Purchase the correct strings for your guitar. Lay the guitar on a flat, soft surface at a comfortable height. Turn the hole of the tuning post so that the hole faces you. Thread your first string through the bridge and into the tuning peg. Grab the string on both sides of the peg and crimp it in an "s" shape. Wrap the end of the string around the other half to lock the string in place. Lightly hold down the string as you slowly tighten it. Repeat the process on the rest of the strings. Cut the ends of the string off. Tune your guitar frequently once the new strings are on.
Work a starting chain of 13 chain stitches.          You'll need to start your work by tying a slipknot onto the hook. If you do not know how to do this, see the "Tips" section for more detail. You can also check the "Tips" section for instructions on working a chain stitch.  Skip the first stitch of your previous row, then work one single crochet into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.          When finished, this row should have 12 stitches. Check the “Tips” section for more information about working single crochets.  Work one single crochet decrease across the next two stitches of the previous row. Single crochet once in each of the next eight stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the final two stitches of the row.          When finished, you should have 10 stitches in this row. If you do not know how to work a single crochet decrease, check the “Tips” section for instructions.  For the next row, simply work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row.          This row should have a total of 10 stitches.  Work one single crochet decrease into the first two stitches of the third row. Single crochet once into each of the next six stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the last two stitches of the row.          There should be eight stitches in this row when you finish it.  Work one single crochet into each stitch of the fourth row to complete the fifth row.          This row should also have 8 stitches, just like the previous row had.  Continue working rows with two single crochet decreases in them, separated by rows of nothing but single crochets. Repeat this for another seven rows, until you reach the twelve row.          Row six should have six stitches (one single crochet decrease, four single crochets, and one single crochet decrease). Row seven should have six stitches (six single crochets). Row eight should have four stitches (one single crochet decrease, two single crochets, and one single crochet decrease Row nine should have four stitches (four single crochets). Row ten should have two stitches (one single crochet decrease, one single crochet, and one single crochet decrease). Row eleven should have two stitches (two single crochets). Row twelve should have one stitch (one single crochet decrease).  The basic triangle is finished at this point. To smooth out the edges, work one single crochet into each stitch around the sides of the work and three single crochets into the gap at each point.          Cut the yarn, leaving a 2 inch (5 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook and tighten it to tie off the triangle. Weave the tail into the back of the work to hide it.	Create a foundation chain. Work 12 single crochets across the chain. Decrease twice in the next row. Single crochet in each stitch. Decrease twice in the fourth row. Single crochet in each stitch for the fifth row. Repeat this pattern for another seven rows. Single crochet around the edge of the piece.
No matter how well thought out your beat is, if you're just using an 808 kick and a weak General MIDI snare, no one is going to want to listen to your beat. It's important to find drum kits and loops with some extra flair to really make a good beat. There are many producer packs you can download to get a wide range of effective kicks, snares, hi-hats, and claps.; , Different genres of music have different rules and structures for beats. Most hip hop beats have syncopated kicks and a snare or clap every other bar. Often, closed hi-hats are used to play 16th notes, while open hats are put in the offbeat. This is common for more contemporary sounding beats and is used in a lot of dirty south, crunk, hyphy, and glam rap, but some more older beat uses hat.  Very few good hip hop or rap beats are made without some form of repetitive loop. Different rap producers use different kinds of instruments and sounds to make effective loops. Timbaland uses a lot of synths and ethnic instruments, while Dr. Dre uses a lot of orchestral hits. Mf Doom uses vintage sounds often from old cartoons. The type of sounds you use to make your track should reflect the general emotions you want that particular track to convey and your own style. Experiment with what sounds best. When you have the sound fonts you want to use, figure out some rhythmic loops and try not to make them too complex or the rapper will have to work harder for the listener's attention. Figure out another simple loop for the chorus that should be catchier then the rest. After a couple verses, try an instrumental bridge, and then go back in for the last few verses.  This is pretty easy if you've already written your loops. Try to make something that augments the original loop but doesn't compete with it. Well made bass lines are subtle and add to the song rather then just arbitrarily hang in the background.  Try adding a small amount of reverb to your snare or clap, and a bass boost to the kick. Make sure to use effects in moderation, not to distort the track and make it unlistenable.  Make sure the beat is loud enough to be heard without overpowering the main melody. The hi-hats should be quieter than the kick and snare. Experiment with the sound levels until you are satisfied with the end result.	Get Tight Sounds. Understand the Structure of a Beat. Make Instrumental Loops. Make a Bassline. Add Effects. Master the Track.
Because crystal is made with lead, it feels heavier than glass. Pick up the object and you should notice it feels solid and with some heft. Pick up a glass object of a comparable size. Most likely, it will feel light.Lead-free crystal feels lighter and more durable but still shines when held up to the light., Due to the sculpting process, crystal has a smooth, rounded feel. Touch any decorative facets you find. Also run your hand along the object’s surface. Glass feels more brittle, even though crystal is more fragile. The cut on the glass may also feel sharper., Flick the object with your finger or tap it against something solid. If it is crystal, it will ring. If it is glass, it will produce a thud.Wet your finger and rub it around the object’s rim, if possible. Crystal will produce a musical tone, but glass won’t.	Check the object’s weight. Feel the object for sharpness. Strike the object to test its sound.
You'll need to measure from your waist to the desired spot on your leg for length and around your waist. The first one will be how long your petticoat is (from waist to knee, say) and the second one gives you the proper length around (it'll bunch up significantly).   Once you have your waist measurement, multiply it by 2 1/2. That's how long your piece of material needs to be. Cut your fabric (tulle or crinoline) with these two measurements in mind.  For the purposes of this article, tulle will be referred to as the fabric.  ; , This will form the base of your skirt shape. Since tulle is rough to the touch, you'll want to use your sewing machine to sew down both sides of the seam, keeping it from being itchy and irritating.   Start from the bottom and go to the top, leaving an opening to step into.  There are a few ways to do this and if you know of another, by all means use it. Here is one method to get the job done:   Use a buttonhole thread and zig-zag across it, creating a channel to use for gathering later. You may need a special foot on your machine to do this. The thread should be able to be pulled out when you're finished. Sew from the inside-out; the material will travel better as you sew along the loop if you do it from this side.  You'll want a length that's long enough for your waist, plus an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) for overlap. Place a pin at the mid-point and quarter-points. Do the same to your tulle (this is to make sure your fabric gets spread evenly along the waistband).  It will force the tulle to gather as you do so. Continue this action until the tulle is gathered to the desired width for your waist. When the pins match up, that's it!   Pin the grosgrain to the top of the tulle at different lengths. For the final pin, wrap the buttonhole thread around it to keep it from moving as you sew.  Pin the tulle evenly to the grosgrain as this will be how it lies when finished.  Since tulle rips fairly easily, the zigzag is a good stitch to use. Once you've sewn all the way around, remove all the pins. Double-check to see if you've missed any!   If there's any excess tulle above your seam, trim it down with a pair of scissors. It'll be less itchy and less likely to tear.  This fills out the waistband, reinforces it, and keeps the edge of the tulle from irritating your skin. Just eyeball it as you sew.   You can use a straight stitch for this part. Sew the bias binding at the top and bottom, with a negligible seam on either side.  Remember how you didn't sew it all the way up at the beginning? That's so you can hook it together as need be. Now's the time to add a hook and clasp and then you're finished!   Whatever style you have at your disposal should work. The grosgrain and bias binding are sturdy enough to support most clasps. If you'd like ruffles, use the same method you did with the waistband and simply add a long, wide strip to the bottom.	Grab your measuring tape. Join the two cut edges. Sew the top of the tulle at the waistline to prepare for gathering. Grab some petersham grosgrain. Pull out the buttonhole thread. Sew the grosgrain to the tulle with the zigzag stitch. Add bias binding to the opposite side of your grosgrain. Add a hook and clasp to either of the open sides.
For this no-bake clay recipe, you will need the following ingredients:          2 cups baking soda 1 ¼ cup water 1 cup cornstarch  , In a saucepan, combine the baking soda and cornstarch. Slowly add the water into the mixture. Continue stirring the mixture while heating it over medium heat. This should take about 4-5 minutes.         The mixture will start thickening up quickly. When it is almost the same consistency as playdough, the clay is done.  When the clay has reached the appropriate thickness, remove the saucepan and pour the mixture onto a clean surface. Cover with a dishtowel until cool.          You may have to spoon out the mixture if you can't get it to pour from the saucepan. Once the dough has started to cool, knead it until it's thin and smooth. You can also use a rolling pin.  If you'd like a variation of the no-bake clay that doesn't require any cooking, use this recipe instead.          Gather the following ingredients: 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup salt, and 1/2 cup cornstarch. Mix the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Slowly add warm water until the clay mixture starts becoming hard. Sprinkle flour on a clean surface, and place the clay on top of it. Knead the clay.  The clay should be easily shaped into different shapes. If it gets a little too hard, add a tiny bit of water.Allow the shaped clay to dry overnight before painting.         Paint the figures using acrylic paint or other types of craft paint. Add glitter, accents, or other craft accessories to your figures and shapes. To change the color of the clay, add food coloring to the clay. Separate the clay into different sections to make different colored clays. You can seal the clay when you're finished by adding a clear coat, such as shellac, acrylic spray, or clear nail polish.	Gather the ingredients. Mix the ingredients. Remove from heat. Try an alternate no saucepan, no-bake recipe. Shape the clay into figures.
Unfurl the snake and lower the bulbous metal end into the toilet bowl. Begin the feeding the snake into the mouth of the drain. At the end of the snake is a curved hook, which will help break up and grab debris that has accumulated in the pipes.; , Once the snake is in position, start steadily rotating the handle on the opposite end. This will extend the snake and force its length slowly through the pipes. Plumbing snakes are constructed with flexible metal coils, so it will be able to bend and follow the contours of the pipes as it is unwound.Unclogging a toilet with a snake is as simple as turning the crank a few times.  If you notice the snake slowing down or coming to a stop, it may have encountered resistance. Jostle the shaft slightly to help the snake loosen up whatever is stuck deep in the pipes. Continue turning the handle in a clockwise direction until the snake clears the pipe.Don’t be rough with the shaft of the snake or try to draw out the clog by force. Just keep winding and unwinding and let it wear down the clog on its own.  After you locate and work over the clog, rotate the handle in the opposite direction (counterclockwise) to retract the snake and examine what it has collected. Always pull out the clog rather than trying force it deeper into the pipe. Repeat this process until the pipe is completely unobstructed.Pushing the clog further in may end up making the problem worse, as eventually it can get so deep that you can no longer reach it.Always make sure to sanitize your snake after each use. This can be accomplished by rinsing the snake off outside with a garden hose. You can also leave the end of the snake in the toilet for a few flushes after you've added toilet bowl cleaner., Lay down a couple of towels or a sheet of plastic to protect the floor. It’s possible that water may splash out of the toilet bowl as the snake works on the clog. This water will often become dingy as whatever is causing the clog disintegrates and leeches back through the pipes. Covering the floor can keep you from having to deal with a second mess later on.If you’re using a towel, wash it immediately after you’re finished and wipe down the floor beneath with a disinfecting solution.  Things are likely to get messy, so pull on a pair of rubber gloves to provide a barrier between your bare skin and whatever muck you may find on the other end of the snake. Toilets are full of germs, and if you don’t take proper care to protect your hands and keep them clean, the result may be illness and infection. Throw the gloves away when you’re finished and wash your hands for a full minute with antibacterial soap and hot water.Debris that is snagged on the end of the snake will have to be removed by hand. Don’t forget to roll up your shirtsleeves as you work to get them out of the way.  You’ve managed to pull out the clog that’s been blocking the pipe, but now what do you do with it? Rather than trying to flush it again and risk creating a new problem, have a trash bag or bucket on hand that you can put the icky clog material into. That way, you can simply drop the bag in the garbage or give the bucket a good rinse and carry on with your day.A plastic grocery bag makes a perfect means of disposal. After you drop the offending clog inside, tie off the bag and chuck it in the trash.  Once the job is finished, plunge the toilet a few times to get rid of any remnants of the clog. Then, pour some concentrated toilet bowl cleaner into the toilet and give it a couple flushes. The chemicals in toilet cleaning solutions are potent enough to dissolve and whisk away whatever residual debris remains in the pipes. As an added bonus, your latrine will be sparkly clean, sanitized and ready for use afterwards.Only use cleaners that are intended for toilets. Regular drain cleaners can eat through galvanized plumbing pipes and wreak havoc on septic systems.A homemade declogging solution made from vinegar and baking soda can also work wonders on clearing out your pipes after they've been snaked. Simply pour about a cup of baking soda into the bowl, add two cups of vinegar (gradually, so that the mixture doesn't bubble over into the floor), wait ten minutes and flush., Before putting anything in the toilet, make sure that it’s meant to be there. The list of things it’s okay to flush down the commode is pretty short: in most cases, human waste and toilet paper only. Never try to get rid of paper towels, Kleenex tissues, makeup pads, tampons, condoms, cardboard, hair or any other materials that aren’t easily dissolved by flushing them. You’ll just be setting yourself up for inconvenience (and possibly expensive plumbing repairs) later on.Toys are a leading culprit of clogs in households with small children. If you have kids, keep the door to your bathroom shut and make sure they know that it’s not a good place to play. If you’re not sure whether or not a certain item is safe to flush down the toilet, chances are it isn’t.  Most clogs are caused by a buildup of excess toilet paper that gets stuck in the pipes before it has time to completely break down. Be aware of the amount of toilet paper you flush on a regular basis, and see that you only use as much as you need. If you have multiple bathrooms in your home, try using a different one from time to time so that one toilet’s plumbing isn’t constantly getting overworked.Be conservative. There’s no need to use half a roll of paper every time you wipe.If you often find yourself troubled with clogs, consider switching to single ply toilet paper. It may not be as comfortable or absorbing, but it breaks down much faster after it’s flushed.  The best way to prevent a clog is to take note when you suspect one might be building up. If the water level in your toilet seems low, or it has trouble flushing or refills slowly, there may be an obstruction throttling the water flow somewhere. Use a plunger to dislodge clogs before they get bad enough that you have to break out the snake.Look for bubbles in the water in the toilet bowl and keep an ear out for rattling in the pipes. These could also be signs of blockage. Snaking should be reserved for stubborn clogs. Plunging, cleaning and not putting anything in the toilet that doesn’t belong there should be your first defenses. If you’re careful, you’ll rarely find yourself in a situation that requires the use of an auger.  Make sure that you’re cleaning your potty at least once or twice a month. Use chemicals specifically formulated for use in toilets and pay attention to any signs that suggest a clog might be forming. As has already been mentioned, chemical cleaners can help melt down stubborn clots of toilet paper and other gunk that’s become lodged in the pipes. Besides that, it will keep the place where you do your business fresh and pleasant.Cleaning your toilet’s water jets ensures that it’s flushing at full power, which will help knock out potential messes caught in the plumbing.	Place the end of the snake into the toilet. Turn the crank handle clockwise. Feel around for the clog in the pipes. Break up or pull out as much of the clog as you can. Cover the floor around the toilet. Wear gloves. Have a trash bag or other receptacle ready. Flush the pipes with toilet cleaner. Only put water-soluble items in the toilet. Reduce the amount of toilet paper you use. Identify the problem early. Keep the toilet and pipes clean.
Because of the algae needs water flow and floats, you can place it in the sump compartment of the aquarium filter system. Sump compartments are the secondary tanks that are connected to the display aquarium tank that helps filter the water.This will allow the algae to absorb the nitrates and phosphates it needs for growth., After the algae has filtered the nitrates and phosphates, you can move the algae into the main part of the aquarium. You can prune part of the algae and place it in the tank for the fish to eat. Alternately, you can move the entire plant into the main aquarium part for the fish to eat on., If you don’t want to place the ulva algae in the sump compartment, you can place it directly in your aquarium. You can drop it in the water, where it will float on top of the water., Algae is a free floating plant. However, you can attach it to a rock or shell in your aquarium. Use a touch of superglue to attach the algae to whatever surface you want in your tank. Alternately, you can try tying a string around part of the algae and the surface you want to anchor it to.	Put the algae in the sump compartment. Move it to the main aquarium. Drop the algae in the aquarium water. Anchor the algae to a surface.
This will make it easier to create your 3D drawing.; , Draw lightly at first so you can erase any unnecessary pencil marks later.  At this point don't worry if they are completely visible in real life. They will help finish your drawing.  Move to a different angle if you need to see where some lines should go. Once you have finished the basic outline, erase any line you cannot actually see from the angle in which you are drawing.  Begin drawing the details in pencil, then retrace with ink. Once the ink is finished add the coloring and shading for the object.	Choose the object you would like to draw, sit in front of it or at an angle. First draw the base of the object and work your way up. Sketch the lines that will make up the pieces you can't completely see. Sketch in the rest of the object's frame. Trace over the outline in ink, and erase the pencil line after the ink has dried.

Determine the length of your rake holder and then saw off the handle using an electric saw. Take safety precautions before using the electric saw and make one clean cut at the designated area.   Use sandpaper to soften the sawed off edges. Polish with a soft cloth.      ; , Use liquid dish detergent and hot water to clean the rake.   Dry thoroughly before use.  Most likely the place where the handle began would be ideal.   Find a place on the wall that will hold the rake. Consider marking that spot with a pencil.  Drill ¾ of the way into the wall leaving enough room to hold the rake.   Hang your utensils or glassware!	Remove rake handle. Scrub rake, especially if you are recycling an old rake. Identify the area of the rake that can be mounted to the wall. Drill screw into an area you’ve marked on the wall.
If the boot tray needs cleaning, do so now and dry thoroughly before proceeding.; , If making a pattern, you could do something like these suggestions:  Add different shades of pebbles in varying ways, such as stripes, wavy stripes, geometric shapes, etc.       Design a letter, number or symbol in the center or across the pebbles; use differently colored pebbles to make it obvious.   Work in small sections at a time, starting at a corner edge and working methodically across the tray. Paint a small area of the tray's corner with glue, then add a dab of glue to each pebble.       Press the pebble in place. Keep the pebble as flat as possible––the surface should not be too bumpy for the boots and shoes to sit on.       Repeat for each pebble in that section.       Move onto the next section. Move across and add pebbles according to your pattern or randomly.  When you near the end, it is a good idea to test which pebbles will fit before adding the glue, as there may be some rearranging required before everything will fit neatly. Try not to leave large gaps!  , Also follow the manufacturer's instructions with respect to time.  Paint or spray a suitable sealant across the top of the pebbles.  Encourage all members of the household to place their muddy, wet or snow-covered boots and shoes on the tray to drain.  Wipe down and wash it regularly. It may also need to be drained every few days if water has amassed in it from melting snow, etc.	Place the tray on a newspaper covered work surface. Decide whether you want to make a pattern with the pebbles or just add them randomly. Use the glue to attach the pebbles. Continue until all the pebbles are in place. Let dry for at least 24 hours before going to the next step. Apply a sealant. Place the pebble boot tray in your mudroom or entrance way. Keep the tray clean.
Before adding anything to alter the soil pH, always make sure to test your soil to see how far it is from your goal pH. You can purchase a test at your local home/garden center or take a sample to your county extension office for professional testing.  The pH of your garden soil is easy to determine with a commercial pH testing kit. These are usually sold at hardware stores or garden supply stores and are fairly inexpensive. To begin, you'll want to take a sample from the area you want to test. Dig five small holes (about six to eight inches deep). Select random locations within the plot — this way, you'll get a sense of the "average" pH of your soil.Don't keep any of the dirt from creating the holes.   Note that the instructions in this section are generalized — you should use the instructions included with your specific pH testing kit.  Next, use your shovel or spade to take a narrow "slice" from the side of each hole. This slice should be crescent-shaped and about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Try to make your sample about the same size for each hole. Add your samples to a single clean, dry bucket.   Try to gather enough dirt in each sample that you have about a pint (0.94 liters) or more in total. For most methods of testing, this is plenty.  Allow your soil to dry until you can no longer detect moisture.   It's important to make sure your soil is completely dry before proceeding — moisture can cause an inaccurate pH reading., Depending on the type of kit you have, the method will vary. For many of the most common test kits, you'll put a small amount of your soil in an included test tube, add a few drops of liquid solution, mix by shaking, and allow the mixture to settle for a few hours.Eventually, the color of the solution should change — by comparing the color of the solution to a chart provided with the kit, you can determine the pH of your soil.   Other types of kits exist as well, so be sure to use the instructions provided with your kit. For instance, some modern electronic testing kits determine a soil pH almost instantaneously via a metal probe. You can also collect a sample and take it into your county extension office for a free soil test.  Many types of organic matter, like compost, composted manure, and acidic mulches (e.g. pine needles) can gradually lower your soil pH over time.As organic matter decomposes, bacteria and other microbes grow and feed upon it, creating acidic by-products in the process. Because organic matter needs time to decompose to alter the soil, this option is great for long-term goals, but won't give you dramatic results in the short-term. Many gardeners opt to add organic matter to their soil annually for a gradual, mild pH-lowering effect. However, this will not work for heavy clay soils.   Organic matter can also give your soil other benefits — most noticeably, improving its drainage and aeration., For rapid pH-lowering, don't rely on the slow, gradual decay of organic matter. Instead, use one of the many acidic soil additives available at your local garden supply store. Of these additives, aluminum sulfate, is one of the quickest-acting options available. Aluminum sulfate produces acidity in the soil as soon as it dissolves, which, for gardening purposes, means that it basically works instantly.Because of this, aluminum sulfate is a great choice for urgent pH lowering.   Depending on the starting pH of your soil, the amount of aluminum sulfate you should use can vary significantly. In very general terms, you should expect to use about 1.2 pounds of aluminum sulfate to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one on the pH scale (e.g., from 7.0 to 6.0, from 6.0 to 5.0, etc.).However, using too much additive can be harmful to your plant, so consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information. Do not use aluminum sulfate for large applications because it can lead to aluminum accumulation and aluminum toxicity in soil., Another useful pH-lowering soil additive is sublimed sulfur. Compared to aluminum sulfate, sulfur is generally cheaper, more powerful (in terms of the amount needed) and slower-acting. This is because sulfur needs to be metabolized by bacteria in the soil to be converted to sulfuric acid, which takes time.Depending on the moisture of the soil, the amount of bacteria present, and the temperature, sulfur can take up to several months to produce a noticeable effect in the soil.   As noted above, compared to aluminum sulfate, you will generally need a relatively small amount of pure, sublimed sulfur to produce an equivalent pH change. In general, you'll need about 0.2 pounds of sulfur to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one whole number on the pH scale.Consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information.  Like sulfur and aluminum sulfate, soil additives containing sulfur-coated urea can increase the acidity of soil over time (lowering its pH). As an additive, urea is fairly quick-acting, producing some effects as soon as a week or two after being introduced to the soil.Sulfur-coated urea is a common ingredient in many fertilizers, so if you were already planning on fertilizing your plants, you may want to save yourself the trouble of finding a separate soil additive by simply picking a fertilizer containing this type of urea.   Sulfur-coated urea content will vary from fertilizer to fertilizer, so consult the instructions that come with your fertilizer to determine the right amount to use for your gardening needs. Sulfur-coated urea is a slow-release fertilizer that doses nutrients out slowly as your plants need them, rather than distributing them all at once.  Besides the additives listed above, many other substances can lower soil pH. Many of these substances are often included in certain fertilizer mixes, while others are sold on their own. The time and amount needed can vary greatly for each, so consult the additive packaging or talk to an experienced employee at the gardening supply store. Additives that can lower your soil pH:Diammonium phosphate Ferric sulfate Peat Ammonium nitrate  , If your soil is too alkaline (basic) to grow plants which require acidic soil, raising alkaline-loving plants can gradually lower the pH of your soil over the life of the plant. As the plant grows, matures, and decays, the organic matter that returns to the soil will promote the growth of bacteria and gradually lower the pH level of the soil (similar to how adding organic matter in the form of mulch or manure). This method is generally one of the slowest ways to lower your soil pH, as the plant must grow to begin depositing organic matter in the soil. A few examples of alkaline-tolerant plants:Certain evergreen shrubs (e.g., boxwoods, California lilacs) Certain deciduous shrubs (e.g., lilacs, mock oranges, Forsythia species) Certain perennials (e.g., picks, hellebores)  , Certain types of flowering shrubs, like rhododendron and azalea plants, require fairly acidic soil to grow properly. These plants are often native to areas with a high amount of rainfall, like the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (frequent rainfall generally lowers soil pH).For these types of shrubs, a pH range of about 4.5 - 5.5 is optimal. However, pH levels as high as 6.0 are usually acceptable., Many brightly-colored flowers, like petunias and begonias, grow best in acidic soils. For some of these flowers, changing a soil acidity from slightly acidic to very acidic can produce a visible change in the bloom color. For instance, growing a hydrangea in soil with a pH level of about 6.0 - 6.2 will produce a plant with pink flowers, while lowering the pH level to about 5.2 - 5.5 will produce a plant with purple/blue flowers.The blue color of low-pH hydrangeas comes from the chemical aluminum. When the pH of the soil is low, it's easier for the hydrangea to absorb aluminum from the soil, which shows in the flower petals., Many needled evergreen trees grow in slightly acidic soil. For instance, spruces, firs, and pines all thrive in soils with a pH level of about 5.5 - 6.0. In addition, the needles of these types of trees can be introduced to neutral or alkaline soil as organic matter which lowers soil pH as the needles decay.  Perhaps the most well-known acid-loving plant is the blueberry, which thrives in highly acidic soils (generally about 4.0 - 5.0 is ideal). However, several other species of berry also favor acidic soil. For instance, cranberries grow best at a level of about 4.2 - 5.0, while gooseberries, currants, and elderberries grow best at a level of about 5.5 - 6.5., Most varieties of garden ferns prefer soil pH levels below 7.0 — even those that prefer alkaline soils can usually tolerate slightly acidic soils. For instance, Maidenhair Ferns prefer soil pHs of about 7.0 - 8.0 but can grow even in soils with levels of about 6.0.Some ferns can even tolerate soils with a pH as low as 4.0., The number of plants that survive or thrive in low pH soils is too great to list in this article. For more information, you may want to consult a comprehensive botanical resource. You can usually find these at gardening stores or specialty book stores, though many are also available. For instance, the official site of The Old Farmer's Almanac contains a table listing the pH preferences of many different types of plants (you can access it here).	Test the soil pH. Dig five small holes in the planting area. Take a sample from each hole. Mix the soils in the bucket and spread on newspaper to dry. Use your testing kit to determine the precise pH level of your soil. Add organic matter. Add aluminum sulfate. Add sulfur. Add sulfur-coated urea. Add another acidic additive. Grow alkaline-tolerant plants. Lower soil pH for shrubs like rhododendrons and azaleas. Lower soil pH for flowers like begonias and hydrangeas. Lower soil pH for evergreen trees. Reduce the soil pH for certain berries. Drop the pH to just below neutral for ferns. Consult a gardening resource for a comprehensive list of acid-loving plants.
This step is important as it lets people know what you're doing and to come and join in. Before you advertise, it's a good idea to have a catchy name and descriptive phrase and a distinctive graphic design for your Theatre's name. Use colors that stand out, to grab people's attention. And have an email address and phone number ready for taking messages so that these can be included with the advertising materials. It's a good idea to encourage people to join early, so that you can begin to get an idea of numbers; to this end, try to include an early joining incentive as part of your advertising, such as a discount, if you're charging fees or an extra ticket for family for the final show. Some ways to advertise include:   A good way to advertise is to get a magnetic giant sticker with your organization's name, phone number and your goal for actors (short, like a catchy motto), and put it on your car. Every time you drive, people will see it.  Put a classified ad in the newspaper. It will cost a little more, but a lot of people may see it. Ask whether this is also repeated in the online version of the newspaper––classifieds often are now. Get picket signs with your key information printed on them and put them up around town (with permission) to advertise. Make small posters and flyers. Place these in strategic locations like local shop windows (ask first), library bulletin boards, school message boards, washateria board, church boards, etc. Wherever people gather in a community space is a good place to advertise. Set up a Twitter and Facebook account. Share the links with friends and ask them to pass it on. Leave useful information on both accounts and update regularly to keep people noticing your presence.	Advertise your Readers' Theatre. Emphasize that Readers' Theatre plays promote confidence, reading skills and good study habits using simple scripts for plays such as books, holiday themes and classics such as Cinderella that are appropriate an d fun for children to perform.
If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it and let it dry completely. This method will work best on canvas shoes and bags., You might want to use pure beeswax for this, without any additives. Anything else may contain harmful chemicals., You can do this by blowing them with a hairdryer or leaving them out in the hot sun for a few minutes. This will make the wax easier to apply. You do not want the clothes to be hot, and you do not want the wax to be melted., Rub it side-to-side and up-and-down. This will help the wax get into the weave of the fabric.If you are covering a piece of clothing or a bag, use the corners of the wax to get into small seams and spaces., Gently rub the wax into small, tight areas, such as seams, corners, and pockets. If the item you are covering has buttons, make sure to wipe the wax off., This will allow the wax to melt into the fabric. You will see the fabric becoming a little darker., If there are any pools or puddles of wax, run your fingers across the fabric in circular motions to smooth it out. This will give your piece a nice finish., Leave it there for 24 hours.After this time, the waxed article will be ready to use. You may notice that the fabric is a little stiffer and darker than before. This is normal. The fabric will soften with time, but it won't get lighter again.	Start with a clean piece of fabric. Purchase a bar of natural beeswax. Heat the wax and cloths a little. Rub the beeswax across the fabric in both directions. Spread the wax out with your fingers to make it move even. Heat the item again with a hair dryer for about five minutes. Smooth the item again with your fingers, if necessary. Set the item to cure in a warm, dry place.
The first and most important step to correcting understeer while cornering is mental. You need to recognize what the vehicle is doing as understeer in order to take corrective action to address it.Identifying that you are in an understeer situation is the only way you can know to correct it. Pay close attention to the response you get from your vehicle to identify understeer.; , When you turn the steering wheel and find the vehicle not responding by turning as much as it should, the natural response is to turn the wheel even more. Once that fails to work, the next natural reaction is to hit the brakes as you realize you have limited control of the direction the vehicle is traveling. These are both dangerous responses to understeer that can result in an accident.Turning more and hitting your brakes could lock the tires and remove any control you currently have over the vehicle. If the brakes do slow the vehicle quickly, the weight of the vehicle will shift onto the front wheels that are turned too far, resulting in the vehicle suddenly and wildly changing directions.  Once you’ve realized that you are in an understeer situation, calmly return the steering wheel to straight. If you are in a corner, turn into the direction you are skidding slightly. This will align the wheels with the direction the vehicle is moving, allowing the tires to start turning again to create grip.Point the wheels in the same direction the vehicle is moving to allow the tires to start spinning again. Make sure to maintain total control of the wheel as you allow it to center itself.  While slamming on the brakes could result in locking up your tires, easing off the accelerator pedal will slow the vehicle in a more subtle manner. As the vehicle slows, the weight will transfer toward the front of the vehicle, adding to the traction your front tires are able to get.Be sure to straighten the wheel out before easing off the throttle to avoid the vehicle turning suddenly as grip returns to the tires. Easing off the throttle will only work if the tires are pointed in the direction the vehicle is moving.  If easing off the throttle did not change the speed of the vehicle sufficiently to return traction to your front wheels, put your foot on the brake and apply them gradually to avoid locking the tires up again and losing steering control.Be careful not to press on the brake pedal too hard or abruptly. If you lock up the front tires under braking, take your foot back off the brake pedal to allow the wheels to begin turning again.	Identify that you’re in an understeer situation. Control your natural response to understeer. Unwind the steering wheel. Ease off the throttle. Apply brakes if need be.
Both NiMh and NiCd batteries can be recharged over time, but you might want to think about investing in NiMh batteries over NiCd. NiMh batteries use newer technology to store more charge and can also be fast, slow, or trickle charged.Check the product in which you plan on using your batteries before purchasing your batteries. Certain equipment may require either NiMh or NiCd to operate best.; , These are one of the least expensive varieties of battery chargers available on the consumer market. A pre-set shutoff timer will charge all batteries in the charger for a period of time and shut off once that time has elapsed.These chargers are less precise than smart chargers, which can lead to under- and over-charging. Take this into account when buying a timer charger; over-charged batteries can be ruined and cost you more money.  Smart chargers can be more expensive initially, but these are equipped with sensors that detect missing voltage in your batteries. This way, your charger will continue to charge your battery until it has reached full charge, saving you the cost of batteries ruined from over-charging., The rechargeable batteries you bought earlier will also help you to decide which charger you invest in. Some chargers are intended for only NiMh or NiCd batteries, though some universal chargers are available.Most AA and AAA battery chargers can be used for both NiMh and NiCd batteries, though you should always consult your manual to be certain.  You should never attempt to charge a battery that isn't intended to be rechargeable. This can cause a dangerous explosion from hydrogen gas buildup and may ruin your battery or charger as well.Check the manual that came with your charger to know the recommended safety procedure for your charger, but generally you should:   Keep your charger and batteries away from fire or intense heat. Do not charge your batteries around or on top of flammable materials, including flammable gases, like gasoline vapor. Insert your batteries into your charger firmly before plugging in your charger. Prevent your charger from being exposed to rain, snow, water, and oil., These kind of batteries experience what is called the "memory effect." This means that if you charge your battery before it is completely dead, your battery will remember the smaller capacity as its full potential, which will hurt your battery life., Some batteries may have a specific amperage for best results. This may include charge times for "fast" or "standard" charge speeds. Always follow manufacturer recommendations for best results and safest use.   As an example, you may see that your battery might have "Std. CHARGE: 60mA 14 - 16 hrs" written on it. This battery would charge best at 60 milliamps for a minimum of 14 hours.  Some chargers come with an interface or a timer that you might need to set. You may be able to set the rate of charge (fast, quick, normal, slow, trickle) as a function of capacity. This is represented by a fraction of the capacity, represented by the format "C/#".You should also set your timer with respect to your charge rate (C-rate).   For example, charging your battery at C/10 will charge 10% of your batteries full capacity per hour, charging your battery fully in a little over 10 hours, depending on efficiency of your charger. Many manufacturers recommend slower rates of charging. Faster charging will result in less efficient charging.  This should be done before you plug your charger into an electrical outlet, unless otherwise indicated by your charger manual. Once you feel the batteries click into place, you can plug in your charger and begin charging.  Once your timer is up or the display on your charger indicates that all batteries are fully charged, as is usually the case with smart chargers, unplug your charger and remove the batteries. If you find that your batteries are difficult to remove, use a gentle tapping motion until one is jarred free.	Learn the differences in battery chemistry to prolong battery life. Evaluate time controlled chargers. Optimize with smart chargers. Purchase an appropriate charger. Follow safe usage guidelines. Wait until the battery is completely drained for NiCds. Check for noted charge rates. Set your charger, if necessary. Insert your batteries. Remove all charged cells.
Come up with a figure you’d ideally like to pay to rent an RV. Do some quick research online or at an RV dealer to get an idea of what some typical rental prices are. You may need more beyond your decided number for deposits or to negotiate. It’s helpful to come up with a maximum number that you absolutely won’t go over.   Write down the number of nights and the approximate number of miles of the trip you plan to take in an RV. RV rentals will often have a per night and/or per mile rate, so it’s helpful to have these numbers on hand to estimate rental prices.; , There are towable RVs—like travel trailers and camper trailers—that attach to the back of your vehicle, and there are motorized RVs—like type A, B, or C motorhomes—that are self-contained with a driving cab.It’s important to decide on an RV type according to your needs, the number of people you’re traveling with, the price you’re willing to pay, and your vehicle’s towing capacity if you’re choosing a towable RV. Opt for a smaller RV for easier navigation if you can, especially if you’re a first-time renter.   For a towable RV, you’ll generally need a vehicle with a high towing capacity, a hitch rated at 5,000 pounds, and an electronic brake controller installed in your vehicle or the proper wiring to rent and attach one.In most states you need only a normal driver’s license to operate any RV recreationally, but some states do require a special commercial or non-commercial license for larger/heavier RVs. Check with your state’s Department of Transportation., Expect to see rental prices per night for RVs, and know that the same renter can have different per night rates depending on the season (usually rates are higher in peak vacation months like July and August). There could also be a per mile rate, which might be something like 34 to 45 cents per mile. Rates will also vary by the type, size, and condition (or age) of the RV.Note that some rental companies will want to place a hold on your credit card while you’re in possession of the vehicle.  Expect extra costs beyond the rental rate for possible things like a security deposit, a small charge for the RV’s generator or propane, additional vehicle insurance, and the price for kitchen utensils and bedding if you’re not providing your own.Of course the cost of your trip will also include gas for the RV, campground rates, and food costs.  Check out the For Rent ads in your local newspaper, Craigslist, or other classified ads for RV rentals. Many private owners will rent out their RVs for reasonable prices when they aren’t using them. Also check out local or national RV dealers with rental locations near you.  Call up the renters you find to make sure they’re still offering the RV offered in their ad, and ask about any additional costs there are on top of the per night or per mile rate to get an idea of the true price you’d pay. Choose your favorites based on the best features and price, and narrow your options down to a number that you can reasonably spend the time to visit before booking and embarking on your trip.  Call your prospects again to set up a time to meet. Get a thorough tour of the inside living space and ask to take a test drive if it’s a motorhome. Larger rental companies will be more equipped to give you a full tutorial, often including an educational video. No matter who you’re renting from, be sure to check that everything works properly and ask questions like:   How do I properly hitch and unhitch a towable RV? How and where do I empty wastewater and sewage? How and when do I run the generator, and at what cost? How do I use the propane to light the stove, run the refrigerator, etc., and at what cost?  , You’ll usually need a driver’s license and car insurance for anyone that will drive or tow the RV. Get copies or receipts for any paperwork or transactions you complete.  Make sure you understand all the upfront costs as well as charges you could face later for damages or generator and propane charges.  Especially if you’re renting from a private seller, you may be able to compromise on a price. Let them know your budget, and see what they can offer you. Come up with a rate that they can agree on that doesn’t go over your maximum budget.   If you’re not happy with their final offer for rent, walk away from deal. They might come back to you with a lower price if they want to rent the RV quickly.  Discuss with the renter if they have options for a payment plan. You make be able to make smaller payments over a longer period of time if you wish.	Pin down your budget. Determine the type of RV you need. Compare prices. Consider extra costs. Check classifieds and local dealers. Narrow your search. Arrange to visit and test-drive. Bring your ID or any other necessary materials. Determine if there is a deposit or charges for damage. Negotiate if you can. Agree on a payment plan.
Common places to look are in your driver's manual which comes with the car. You can ask your car care professional. There should also be a Vehicle Information button on your dashboard with a picture of a car, marked with the letter "I". If your car has a VIC, use the following steps.  Sit down comfortably in the driver's seat, and make sure that all of the doors are closed. Tug on each of the handles from inside to make sure they are all closed tight. Make sure that your transmitter is close to the steering wheel and lock buttons.  Put your key in the ignition and turn it all the way clockwise until you hear the engine come on. Make sure that the gear shift is set to park.  If for some reason the display does not appear, restart your car, and repeat the previous steps. If the display still does not appear, contact your nearest GM car care professional., The Set/Reset button should be near the Vehicle Information button. If you cycle past the option, continue pressing the Set/Reset button until the "Remote Key Learning Active" option reappears., Do this for at least fifteen seconds. You should hear a noise that sounds like a chime. This means that your transmitter has been successfully synced. If that does not happen, it is likely the sync is off, in which case you will have to restart the process.  Do this in rapid succession. If you wait too long, it is likely that your car will go out of sync, and you will have to restart the process for whichever transmitters you have left over.  It is important that you do this, otherwise the lock/unlock features in your car will not properly work. This can result in dangerous circumstances where your locks do not work. If you forget, or take too long to take your key out, start the whole process over again for your own safety and convenience., Get out of your car and close the driver's door. Step away from the car about 20 feet. Press the unlock/lock buttons separately. If they work from this distance, step back to a further distance and try your transmitter from there. If you are noticing that your transmitter is not locking and/or unlocking, start the process over again to ensure that it works. If you have repeated the process numerous times with no success, contact your car care professional for further instruction/help.   If the transmitter works at 20 feet but does not work at, say, 40 feet, the transmitter may not have a strong enough signal to travel that far, or that the transmitter's batteries are low.	Determine if your car has a VIC (Vehicle Identity Check). Get in your car. Start your car. Press and hold the Vehicle Information button until the display reads "Press V to Relearn Remote Key.", Press the Set/Reset button until "Remote Key Learning Active" appears on the display. Press and hold the Lock and Unlock buttons at the same time. Repeat the previous step for each transmitter, up to four. Exit programming mode by turning off the vehicle and removing the key. Test your transmitters.
If you are doing companion planting to improve the look of your garden, you should think about what time of year certain plants bloom. If you know that your roses bloom at the beginning of summer, try planting some plants around them that bloom in the spring and at the end of summer.   Planting plants that bloom at different times of year will keep your garden fun and interesting for more of the year. Planting flowers that bloom at different times of the year is especially important if you are growing roses that are not ever-blooming. For roses that only bloom in the spring, try planting annual flowers beneath them, such as marigolds and pansies. This will give you more color throughout the summer., Adding a variety of colors to your garden will make it look dramatic and interesting. You can use companion plants to bring these different and complementary colors to your garden. For example, if your roses are all light pink, consider planting something nearby that has a drastically different color, such as blooms that are blue.You can even pick color schemes for different times of the year. If your roses are one color, such as pink, you could choose reds for spring and oranges for fall. This can be done with marigolds, zinnias, or even lilies. The change of color will add seasonal excitement.Your can bring different colors into your garden with blooms and with the foliage of companion plants. Some plants that have differing foliage colors and textures that work well in the same beds as roses include hostas, lamb's ear, and coleus., In addition to adding additional colors to your beds, companion plants can add interesting and complementary shapes. This could be the shapes of individual leaves or the shapes of the plants overall.   When using contrasting shaped plants you can use plants that enhance the look of the rose. There are some plants that can mask the weaker aspects of the rose, such as their sparse bottoms. For instance, lavender, catmint, lady’s mantle, and dianthus can all be great planted around roses.	Use plants that flower at different times of year. Pick plants with differing colors. Pick plants that add contrasting shapes.
Pruning done only for the health of the plant should be scheduled for the late winter or early spring, before new growth has had much chance for development.   Since burning bushes are primarily grown for their foliage, you don't need to worry too much about accidentally removing flower buds. The most vibrant foliage will grow on new branches, though, so it is still best to trim the bush before new growth has developed. When you decide to prune a burning bush for the health of the plant alone, you only need to worry about removing branches that could encourage disease to spread through the plant and destroy it. Even if you opt to prune the plant for shape, you should still prune it for health before worrying shape maintenance.; , Use pruning shears to cut away any dead branches or branches that have been severely injured.Branches are most often injured by disease, insect infestation, animals, or bad weather. Cut diseased branched down to their point of origin on the main stem. Doing so is the only way to make sure that the disease does not spread. Injured branches can be cut back to their point of origin on the main stem, or you may wish to only cut away the injured portion of the branch. In the latter case, cut the injured branch down to a side branch and make the cut 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the bud.  Look for any branches or branch stubs that are intertwined or rubbing against each other. Use pruning shears to remove these branches, as well.   Cut these branches down to their point of origin on the main stem. Problem branches like these will typically grow back again in the same direction, so it is best to remove them completely instead of trimming them down.	Prune in late winter or early spring. Remove dead or dying branches. Cut away branches that rub together.
A group of at least 2-5 people is needed to run buses. ,,, Never underestimate the power of word of mouth, talk to everyone you know and meet, face to face interaction is the best way to get people involved.  But it is becoming increasingly popular to sell your tickets online. By using PayPal you can sell your tickets online so that people can pay with a credit or debit card. If you don’t have the ability to do this, then please contact www.protestispatriotism.org they will help you set up a PayPal account, and give you space on their website to sell your ticket.  Most groups don’t issue tickets as they just keep a list of names and check them off as people get on the bus.  Bus captains are responsible for making sure the trip is organized, all the riders are on the bus and for informing the riders about the plans and events.  They are a packet that contains a list of events, a basic map, metro info and arrival / departure times and places. They also offend include some fun items such as stickers, small signs along with general info about weather, what to expect and legal info. If you do not want or have time to create your own you can go to www.protestispatriotism.org they will e-mail you the packet that they create and or work with you to create one.  These trips can be long and sometimes boring. Most charter companies have TVs with DVD players so bring a variety of movies. It is also a great opportunity to start conversation, debate and do some training.	Establish a working group. Give yourself lots of time, running buses is best tackled with 3 months of lead time, but can be done in as little as 1 month.  , Contact a bus company and get a quote.  , Figure your ticket price.  , Advertise by using e-mail lists, fliers and all local media sources that you can utilize. Selling your tickets- you can take check or cash for the tickets. Keep a list of all the people who have bought tickets. Choose bus captains and a medic. Make an info packet, info packets are a great resource and tool for bus riders. Plan the bus trip.
Even if the composition you're writing isn't ultimately meant to be heard on the piano, hearing other finished compositions when you're trying to get inspired can be just the thing you need.   Classical and jazz are the two most noteworthy styles of piano playing. Even if you're only going to be playing in one or the other (or a more contemporary style like pop) it's a good idea to give a listen to these different styles. Keep an ear out for the different chords the players use depending on the style. Look into the work of Liszt, Chopin or Satie for great classically-based piano works. For jazz, Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck and Chick Corea are all players worth looking into.; , Whether you're starting out or an advanced player, warming up your fingers with scales can encourage creativity to flow more freely once you get into the thick of composing. If you know a few scales, try warming up with one you're not as familiar with. Hearing the distinctive tone of a scale might spark the first ideas of a fresh composition.   Scales are a very handy thing to know when it comes time to write melodies. While there's no sure method to write a great melody, knowing which scale you should be using will give you an idea of which notes to use and which to avoid.  Unfortunately, a lot of the time, this happens to fall on the least convenient times where you're either far from an instrument or about to fall asleep. This is why it's a good idea to bring a notebook and/or sound recorder with you wherever you go. If you think of a great melody or rhythm, you can hum it into your mic and adapt it once you're by your piano again.   Most cellphones have a recorder option. If you don't have a cellphone for this purpose, basic handheld recorders tend to be very affordable.  Creativity cannot be forced. If you're trying to break through the writer's block and nothing's working, it may be time to give yourself a break from things. Go do something that has nothing to do with the creative process. Clean your house. Talk to a friend on the phone. Pet a cat. Better yet, take a nap. When you return to it, you don't want to feel any of the frustration you were grappling with before. Creativity is best when you're feeling relaxed.   Going for a walk is a fantastic idea if you're getting frustrated. Many artists have some of their best creative epiphanies when they're out for a stroll.  In some cases, the composer is driven by love and longing. Other times, he's trying to vent out bad emotions. Take a look at your life and single out some of the things that have most affected you in the past while. Have you gone through a break-up? Did you recently go on an unforgettable vacation? Anything that sparks feeling in you is fair game for musical inspiration.	Listen to piano music.There is a vast amount of incredible music written specifically for the piano. Practice scales on the piano. Carry a notebook and handheld recorder wherever you go.You never know when you're going to hit a creative stride. Give yourself a break. Think about what you might like to write music about.Most music (even instrumental music) is directly inspired by something or someone.
Off-brand or generic reeds simply do not play as well or last as long as their more expensive counterparts. Clarinet players of every skill level have had success with Vandorens, but there are other brands out there as well. If price proves to be an obstacle, know where to find deals. While a box of 10 Vandorens may cost 3 or 4 dollars per reed through your local music store, if you buy in bulk from online suppliers, you may be able to get them at half that price.; , Lay new reeds on a flat surface and firmly rub them from the heart to the tip with the back of a teaspoon. This enhances the reed's life expectancy by closing its fibers. , Then dry it, with a cotton cloth of handkerchief, moving towards the tip. Alternatively, if you're in a hurry, just pass it between your thumb and index finger - again, moving towards the tip.  Have three or four good ones with you at any given time, and play with a different one every time, instead of playing on just one reed for a long stretch and then starting over with another new one.  The type of case you need may depend on what type of reed you use, how wet your reeds are when you put them away, and other factors.   Reeds dry best in a well-ventilated case with a ribbed floor, so air can get everywhere. Other cases have glass floors to prevent waves from forming at the tip of the reed. Humidity is always a factor in the lifespan of a reed. Some cases come with replaceable cartridges containing a substance that regulates the humidity level within the case. Avoid storing reeds in the little plastic individual cases they are sold in. While there's nothing wrong with them, it is easier to lose or mix up individually stored reeds, and they'll start to pile up after a while. Never keep reeds in a case that is completely closed. They will go moldy.  This counteracts the effects of your saliva. Leave the reeds in the solution overnight and rinse them well before you use them again.  Don't leave your clarinet standing on its bell with the reed on it (this is a bad idea in the first place, but why risk losing a good reed too?). If you're taking a break from playing, put a mouthpiece cap over the reed to protect it and keep it moist. Don't "wall test" reeds just for the fun of it.	Buy high-quality reeds to start with. Break new reeds in gradually, so the dried material gets used to being wet again. Before playing, soak your reed in clean water instead of wetting it with your saliva, if possible.  , After playing, rinse the reed in clean water. Rotate your reeds. Store your reeds responsibly, with a good reed case. Soak your reeds in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (available at your local drugstore) from time to time. Use common sense to avoid broken reeds.
Drumsticks are usually made of either maple, hickory, or a Japanese white oak. Laminated birch has also recently regained popularity. Each has a slightly different feel. The feel has to do with how the stick transmits or absorbs vibration and how much it flexes.Hickory is a common, well rounded wood for drumsticks. Hickory is favored for its flexibility and impact resistance. Maple is much lighter than hickory, allowing for a larger diameter feel without the weight. Maple is softer and stiffer than maple, which negative impacts the sticks durability. Maple sounds sweeter and brighter on drums and cymbals. Oak is dense and heavy, but transmits vibrations more. It tends to be more durable, but will split with little warning. The increased weight gives drums a bigger, darker sound and yields a very big, but brash cymbal sound. Laminated Birch is made from a high quality birch plywood. These sticks are very heavy and durable. They generate very deep sounds from drums and cymbals. There are smaller companies specializing in exotic woods and Vic Firth is currently making a carbon fiber stick. Also, companies like Ahead make sticks out of nylon.; , Tips come in wood, nylon, or delrin. Nylon tips sound brighter on cymbals and hold up longer without chipping or developing soft spots. They don't typically change the sound of the drums, though the lighter tip weight can create a fast rebound, allowing the drum to speak easier. Delrin is used by some companies in place or nylon since it is supposedly more durable.   Wooden tips have a darker contact sound and a less articulate sound on cymbals.  Tips come in a wide variety of shapes, each with its on sound. Common tip shapes are barrel, acorn, ball, and oval. Each shape has a particular sound. Each shape also comes in multiple sizes. Smaller creates a more articulate sound while larger tips create bigger and deeper sounds. Some companies shape their nylon tips like wood tips; others do not.   Barrel tips have a wide, flat contact surface. This creates a dark, but strong contact sound. Acorn tips have the largest contact surface. This dampens the contact sound significantly, creating a full, but dark cymbal sound. Ball tips have a very small contact surface, creating a very bright contact sound. Oval tips are between barrel and ball tips.  The thickness also changes the sound. There are two ways to know the thickness of a stick. The first is by model number. A's are thinner than B's, which are thinner than S's. Higher numbers represent thinner sticks. So, a 7A is thinner than a 5A, which is in turn smaller than a 5B. This system has become unreliable with the wide range of manufacturers each with a large catalog of sticks.   The other way to know the thickness of a stick is to find its diameter. This is usually measured in inches and displayed as a three digit decimal. .500 is a half inch thick, for example. 7As are thinner and lighter. These will sound sweeter on drums and cymbals and are best for lower volume playing. 5As are slightly thicker than the 7A. These are generally considered to be the most generic and versatile stick. 5Bs are thicker, more intense drumsticks and are often used by rock and metal drummers due to their weight. There are many other models and each company has its own idiosyncrasies. For example, Promark has a thinner 5A than most. Vic Firth's 7A is shorter than most while their 8D is more like everyone's 7A.    Hold the stick as you would while playing. Let it slide through your fingers. Different manufacturers use different coatings that affect grip. Vic Firth favors a thin lacquer while Regal Tip favors a heavy lacquer, making their sticks a bit slicker and more resistant to skin oils and moisture. Promark favors a special finish that becomes tacky as your hands heat it up. Promark also offers many sticks finished only by sanding. Zildjian and Vic Firth also offer many sticks with a rubber coating offer the butt end of the stick. The only way to know what you like is to play with the sticks.  There are many brands of good drumsticks to compare, maybe you could think about your favorite artist's preference in sticks when choosing your own. Here are the top brands with some of their endorsers.   Ahead (Lars Ulrich, Rick Allen) - Ahead is favored by metal drummers due to the durability and weight of their sticks. However, many complain that the sticks hurt their hands.       ProMark (Joey Jordison, Mike Portnoy, Glenn Kotche, Benny Greb) - Promark lacks diversity in tip shapes, but offers some great finish options.       Vater (Chad Smith, David Silvera) - Vater is creates a product much like Vic Firths, but with different shapes.       Vic Firth (John Dolmayan, Vinnie Paul, Mark Guiliana) - Vic Firth offers probably the widest selection of sticks. They favor a light lacquer finish and many of their sticks are painted. ] Zildjian (Dave Grohl, Travis Barker)        , Especially if you're choosing a new kind of drumstick or a brand or size you haven't used before, ask if you can try them. Try them gently on a practice pad so that if you choose something else, the store can still sell them, but try them enough to get a feel for their weight, springiness, and balance.	Choose the right wood. Pick the right material. Choose the shape. Choose the thickness. Check the varnish or lacquer coating on the drumsticks. Choose your preferred brand. Try out the drumsticks.
Allow your plants between one and one and a half inches of water per week. Broccoli likes moist soil.   You can use a rain gauge to see how much water the plants are getting naturally, and make up the difference with irrigation. Make sure not to get the budding broccoli crowns wet when watering. Doing so causes them to mold. In particularly hot or dry conditions, increase the amount of water you feed your plants.  Use an organic, nitrogen-rich fertilizer when your broccoli plants begin to form new leaves. Fish emulsion works well for fertilizing broccoli plants. You can continue to fertilize the plants about once a week until they are ready for harvest.  Broccoli plants have very shallow roots. If you disturb the soil you may accidentally break roots and damage your broccoli plants.   If weeds develop around the plants, suffocate them with mulch instead of plucking them from the ground to avoid disturbing the roots.If you choose not to grow organically, you can also use a chemical pesticide to remove unwanted weeds from your garden without disturbing the broccoli roots.  You want to harvest your broccoli crowns when the buds are tightly closed and dark green. Avoid waiting until the buds begin to flower into light green or yellow flowers. Cut the crown where it meets the stem using garden shears.   See "Choosing a Variety" above for exact growing times for specific varieties. Avoid breaking the crown off. A clean cut will better encourage new growth. With a healthy cut, the broccoli plant should grow small shoots from the side of the stem. You can continue to harvest the small shoots, and the plant should produce more.	Water your broccoli plants regularly. Fertilize your plants about three weeks after planting. Avoid digging or turning the soil. Harvest your broccoli plants.
As a criminal defendant, you have the right to be represented by an attorney. If you don't qualify for a public defender, you should hire a private criminal defense attorney to represent you.It's important to find a defense attorney who specializes in DUI law, as they may know more about alternatives that exist. Even if you qualify for a public defender, a private defense attorney may be better able to assist you if you want alternative sentencing. Your attorney may have more information about the programs available. They also may be able to connect you with professionals and refer you to specific services.; , Your eligibility for many alternative-sentencing programs depends on your personal background, especially your criminal history. You're much more likely to qualify for alternative-sentencing programs if this is your first offense.Your attorney probably will want to pull your criminal record, but any information you can provide in the meantime will be helpful to make a preliminary analysis. You also should provide information about your work and educational history. Any other ties you have to your community also can be helpful. For example, if you are an active member of a local church, or if you coach a youth baseball or basketball team, these connections can help establish your character and your ties to the community. Often, someone who can demonstrate that they are an active and involved member of their community and have a steady employment history will have a better chance of getting into an alternative sentencing program.  The details of alternative-sentencing programs vary greatly among jurisdictions. Since there may potentially be several options from which to choose, you need to make sure the program will meet your needs.Standard programs include a combination of voluntary probation and community service. Because DUIs are strongly correlated to alcohol abuse, many jurisdictions have alternative sentencing programs available that combine some level of inpatient and outpatient addiction treatment. Treatment programs also may be combined with electronic monitoring to ensure that you are not drinking alcohol.  Once you've chosen an alternative-sentencing program that appeals to you, work with your attorney to identify reasons you would be a strong candidate for that particular program.Your attorney may have additional information about the types of offenders who typically are accepted to the various programs. With information about typical participants, you can compare their stories to your own to get a better idea of how you match up and which aspects of your history you should emphasize. Ideally, you and your attorney should look for offenders similar to you who have been successful in the alternative-sentencing program you want. Even though all people and situations are different, you have a better chance of getting into a program if you can show how your situation is similar to someone else who has used the alternative-sentencing program to get their issues with alcohol under control and has not violated the law again.  Character witnesses, such as your supervisor at work or a community leader, can be great allies for you in helping you get into an alternative-sentencing program.Keep in mind that witnesses aren't just people who were with you when you were arrested. People who know you and your character also can be strong witnesses for you. Your attorney probably will ask you for names of witnesses who might have information that would be beneficial to your defense. Be sure you have full names, addresses, and phone numbers so your attorney can get in touch with them. If you decide to start therapy with an addiction specialist, they also may be a good witness for you. They can testify to your progress and your commitment to rehabilitation.  Particularly if you know addiction counseling or driver's training will be required by the alternative-sentencing program anyway, go ahead and enroll. It can help demonstrate your commitment.Going into therapy can be beneficial for you even if you aren't able to make a plea agreement with the prosecuting attorney and end up going to trial. Making a therapy commitment sends a signal both to the prosecuting attorney and the judge that you recognize you have a problem with substance abuse and are doing everything you can to address the issue. Many jurisdictions also require anyone convicted of a DUI to attend safe driving courses. These courses are offered by the state and typically cost several hundred dollars. Taking them beforehand shows that you're serious about making a change.  If you want to negotiate a plea deal, you and your attorney will need to meet with the prosecuting attorney to go over your case. Based on their findings, the prosecuting attorney typically will have an offer for you.Particularly if this is your first offense, the prosecuting attorney may offer a better deal than alternative-sentencing programs. For example, the prosecutor may be willing to reduce your charge to reckless driving. This is particularly likely if there are problems with the evidence in your case, or if the police behaved in such a way that you potentially have an argument that they violated your constitutional rights. Your attorney will talk to you about your arrest at length before you meet with the prosecutor to ascertain if there are any possible defense arguments related to the initial traffic stop or your subsequent arrest.  If the prosecuting attorney has not offered alternative sentencing as an option for you, make sure your attorney brings it up. By asking, you can find out the reasons the prosecuting attorney did not consider alternative sentencing for you.In some situations, the prosecuting attorney will be unwilling to lower the charges from DUI. If that happens in your case, you may benefit from alternative sentencing. Particularly if it's your first offense, there may be probation options available that include a deferred sentencing option. Under deferred sentencing, if you successfully complete probation you won't even have a DUI on your record. Other alternative-sentencing options are related to treatment of alcohol abuse and addiction. This may include inpatient or outpatient addiction treatment.  The prosecuting attorney likely will have done their own research. However, you may be able to tell them information about your background that supports you as a candidate for alternative sentencing options.For example, if you've started outpatient drug rehabilitation or therapy, you may be eligible to enter a residential rehabilitation program. Other information about your employment or your role in your community also may support alternative sentencing. These details typically wouldn't have been available to the prosecuting attorney beforehand. If you have a child or other person, such as an elderly parent, who is dependent on you for support, this also can weigh in favor of alternative sentencing.  The prosecuting attorney's first offer typically isn't their last and final offer. You and your attorney can negotiate something closer to the alternative-sentencing program you have your eye on.Depending on the evidence against you, your attorney most likely will be trying to negotiate a plea bargain in which you plead guilty to a lesser charge, such as reckless driving. However, alternative sentencing programs also may come into account. Your commitment to seeking addiction treatment and taking safe driving courses may help convince the prosecuting attorney to lower the charges as well. Your attorney also may have information about various other defenses you have. Bringing this up to the prosecuting attorney may convince them that alternative sentencing is appropriate for you.  You may be able to get the prosecuting attorney to agree to recommend you for the alternative-sentencing program that you prefer. However, keep in mind this agreement is preliminary and must be approved by a judge.Accepting a plea deal typically means that you must appear in court before a judge. The prosecuting attorney will present the deal to the judge, then the judge will ask you questions. The judge wants to make sure that you understand what you are doing, and that you are pleading guilty to the charges because you are indeed guilty of the crime. Your attorney will go over the process beforehand so you're prepared and know what the judge is going to ask you, but once you stand before the judge you're on your own – your attorney cannot answer for you. However, if you are unable to get the prosecuting attorney to agree to alternative sentencing, you still have the option of arguing at trial to convince the judge that alternative sentencing is appropriate in your case.  Eligibility for many programs is based on your personal history and criminal record. To convince a judge to grant you alternative sentencing, you must first introduce evidence that you meet those eligibility requirements.In a criminal trial, although the jury will determine whether you are guilty or not guilty, the judge typically is in charge of the sentencing. Some jurisdictions have sentencing guidelines that help a judge determine the appropriate sentence, based primarily on your criminal history. If this is your first offense, you typically are automatically eligible for alternative sentencing. If the prosecuting attorney did not offer those options to you, it may have been because there were aggravating factors involved in your case. For example, if you were charged with a DUI after being involved in an auto accident in which someone else was injured, the prosecuting attorney may not be open to alternative sentencing – even if it was your first offense.  Even if you're not an ideal candidate for an alternative-sentencing program, you may be able to sway the judge by discussing the changes you've made in your life since your arrest.For example, if you have a job and family members who are dependent on your income, this can weigh in favor of alternative sentencing such as probation. Needing to maintain your job also can support your argument that any suspended license should be converted to a restricted license so that you can drive to work. If you have children or other family members who depend on you for financial support, this also may weigh in favor of alternative sentencing.  Family members, employers, and community leaders can strengthen your argument that alternative sentencing is right for you. These witnesses typically testify regarding your character and sense of responsibility.Keep in mind that your witnesses typically aren't going to be people who were with you when you were arrested for a DUI – although sometimes they might be. However, even if they were, these types of witnesses aren't going to talk about your arrest, or what you were doing before you were arrested. Rather, they're going to talk about you and who you are as a person. If you're in therapy or treatment for alcohol addition, your therapist or addiction specialist also will be a strong supporting witness for you. They can testify as to your progress in treatment and typically will tell the court that your progress would not be furthered by spending time in jail.	Talk to your attorney about alternative sentencing. Gather information about your personal history. Evaluate available programs. Build supporting arguments. Identify possible witnesses. Consider enrolling in therapy or educational courses. Meet with the prosecuting attorney. Ask about alternative sentencing options. Present information about your case. Negotiate with the prosecuting attorney. Accept a deal that meets your needs. Provide information about your background. Explain how alternative sentencing will benefit you. Call supporting witnesses.
They are often called "bone rings." You can find them in the drapery section or crochet section in a fabric store. A well-stocked craft store may also carry them.  Aim for something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in diameter.  Measure the diameter of the ring. Multiply it by 21/2. Draw a circle on a sheet of cardstock with the new measurement as the diameter. Cut the circle out.If your fabric is a pattern on it, cut a circle out of the middle of your template. The circle needs to be the same size as your ring.  Spread your fabric on a flat surface, right-side-down. Place the template on top of the fabric. Trace around the circle using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out when you are done.If your fabric has a pattern on it, make sure that the template is centered. Use the hole in the middle as a guide.  Place your fabric circle wrong-side-up on the table. Set your plastic ring down in the center. Trace around the plastic ring using a tailor's chalk or pen. Keep your line halfway between the ring and the edge of the fabric., Thread your needle and tie both ends of the thread into a knot. Start sewing on the wrong side of your fabric. Finish sewing on the right side of the fabric. Do not knot the thread when you are done.Make sure that the thread you are using is strong, preferably nylon or polyester., Place the ring on the wrong side of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered. Gently pull on the thread until the fabric gathers around the ring. Don't cut the thread yet.If your fabric has a pattern on it, check the front to make sure that it is centered. Adjust it, if needed.  Using the same needle and thread, pass the needle back through some of the gathers, anchoring them in place. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button. Tie the thread into a knot when you are done. Don't cut it yet., Use a knitting needle or small crochet hook to tuck the raw edges of the fabric under itself and into the covered button., Make two small stitches across the back of the button. Pull on the thread to close the gap. Make two more stitches right across the first two, forming an X. Tug on them gently to further close the gap. Knot the thread, then snip it off., Thread a needle with some embroidery floss. Knot the end of the floss, then sew around the button using a straight stitch or a backstitch. Keep your stitches against the inside edge of the ring. When you are back where you started, knot the floss on the back of the button, then cut it.You can use matching or contrasting embroidery floss.  Place your button on a sheet of felt. Trace around it using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out.The felt can be the same color as your button, or a contrasting one., Use a small whipstitch to secure the felt to the back of the button. When you are back where you started, pull the needle under the felt and out through the center-back of the button. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.  Place a pen over the back of the button. Make two stitches over the pen and through the felt. Make sure that the stitches are coming out of the same spot. When you are done, slide the pen out. You should now have a loop made out of thread.You can also use a pencil, crochet hook, knitting needle, or paintbrush.  Wind the thread around the shank to make it thicker. When you are done, knot the thread to the bottom of the shank. Pull the needle and thread through the felt, and out on the other side of the shank. Snip off the excess thread. Your button is now complete!	Get a small, plastic ring. Make your template. Trace the circle onto cotton fabric, then cut it out. Sketch out your stitching guidelines. Sew a simple straight stitch around the edge of your fabric. Gather the fabric around the ring. Tack the gathers into place. Fold the raw edges of the fabric inside. Sew the gap shut. Sew around the button, just inside the ring. Cut a circle out of felt. Stitch the felt to the back of the button. Make the shank. Reinforce the shank.
Play at different speeds: slow, medium and fast. Use a metronome and practice scales with different beat durations or tempos. Instead of playing through the beat continuously, try a stop-and-go method.For instance, play three notes, pause, play three more notes, pause again, and continue this variation.  Instead of just playing the same piece repeatedly in the same way, try new ways of playing it.Change octaves. Practice with your eyes closed sometimes. Alternate playing softly and loudly. Try practicing while you bounce, dance, wiggle your head, or beatbox.Explore other practice methods, such as chaining. With chaining, you play small units at tempo and slowly build longer chains of units. Start with a small passage and add a measure each time you master a small unit., Play a piece completely through the first time and mark down the places where you ran into difficulty. Take those portions out and practice them separately. Isolating and repeating difficult music passages can help you to master a piece of music.   Instead of getting discouraged when you reach parts that cause you stumble, you extract them and give them hyper-focus until you can play them as well as the rest of the piece., Each day of practicing should at least include a block of playing scales as well as a block of time focused on building technical skills.Repeat one activity (or "block") acceptably before moving on to the next. This encourages comfort with the activity and prompts muscle memory to kick in.For example, spend the first block of time warming up, the second block on a difficult piece of music, the third on proper finger placement, and the fourth on some smaller pieces you have already practiced before.Another approach is to time each block. For example, spend 10 minutes on scales. Even if you don’t get it perfect by the end of that time, move on to the next block. Otherwise, getting stuck can be frustrating.  A good way to do this is to place three objects, such as coins or beads, in front of you (on your music stand, if possible). When you play a challenging measure correctly, move one object to the right. If you play the measure through successfully again, move another object to the right. If you stumble with the notes or rhythm, return all of the objects to the left. You have to play the measure through without errors three times in a row in order to move all of the objects to the right-hand side.Once all of your coins or beads are to the right, you can connect the difficult measure to the measures surrounding it, and then to the rest of the music.  Make flashcards with musical tasks in four groups: warmups, technical methods, difficult or long songs, and easy or short songs. You can list specific songs, scales or chords on the flashcards, or write in general terms such as genres or octaves. Alternate your practice session with “surprise” flash card days. Choose one flashcard at random from each group to determine which musical pieces you will practice that day.   Roll dice: whatever number you get is how many times you will play a measure or a song.Try incorporating your practice into a board game. Keep a board game designated for instrument practice in your music area. Each time you master a piece of music or a technique, move up a space on the game board and write down what you achieved.	Change your timing. Use different practice techniques. Isolate trouble spots. Break practice sessions into blocks. Use visible benchmarks to master difficult measures. Make practice into a game.
If you primarily seek durability, saddle blanket seat covers are known for being tough, so your money goes a long way. If you want seat covers that can be thrown in the washing machine in the event of stains, a polyester-cotton blend may be best.  The color can be different from the shade of your original car seats, but it should complement the exterior of your car. Keep in mind that lighter covers tend to show stains easily, while black covers may feel particularly hot on warm days.  This is an ideal way to show some personality in your car. For example, a Hawaiian pattern can display your fun side, while camouflage can provide your car with a masculine look.	Select a fabric for your car seat covers that best meets your needs. Pick a color. Consider fabrics with patterns or designs.
Trace your hand with a pencil on plain white paper. Cut the handprint out with scissors. You can also wait until you’ve painted the handprints to cut them out. Repeat this until you have about 10-12 handprints.10-12 handprints is a good amount, but you can cut out as many as you’d like.; , Acrylic paint, or any type of paint that is made for kids, will work. Choose 3 or 4 colors. Purple, pink, red, and yellow work well together. Use a paintbrush to paint each handprint that you cut out.Keep a cup of water beside you to wash the paintbrush as you switch colors.  Once the paint has dried, use glue or cellotape to attach the handprints to straws. Any type of plastic or paper straws will work. Cut the bottom of the straws to vary the lengths so that they look better once arranged in the flower pot.You can use regular Elmer’s white glue to attach the handprints to straws.  You can use any flower pot. Arrange the handprint flowers in the flower pot. Place some Play-Doh or Blue-Tac at the bottom of the straws to weigh the flowers down in the pot. Fill the pot about halfway with strips of tissue paper once you are satisfied with the flower arrangement.You can add or take away handprints until you are satisfied with the outcome.	Trace and cut out handprints. Paint the handprints. Attach handprints to straws. Put the hand print flowers in a flower pot.
This should be as clean as possible with little or no background noise.       Sound Effects/Foley. Sound effects like traffic and animal sounds can either be recorded or found in libraries which are used in feature films, though these must be purchased for royalty-free use. Foley effects, such as footsteps and the rustle of clothes, are best recorded yourself using a condenser microphone.       Tempo music. This is music which is used by editors to set a pace but is not used in the final mix.       Atmosphere. This is the background sound to a scene such as in a wood it might be the rustle of trees and birdsong, it is used to give continuity to a scene which may have been filmed in different locations. ,, You monitor sound through speakers and headphones, using meters as a reference. Use flat equalization and keep the volume the same the whole time you do the mix to ensure a consistent volume no matter how many tracks are being mixed. Make sure to turn off any equalizers, bass boost, or other enhancements that may be available on the monitoring system.; , Avoid using cheap computer speakers and instead use a high quality stereo and amplifier with the equalizer set to flat.  The lack of ambient sound, coupled with the extreme stereo field, creates an unrealistic monitoring environment that often doesn't translate to larger systems.   Mixing solely using headphones is usually avoided, but you can use them if you keep in mind that it sounds different from speakers as sound is not bouncing off surfaces, you will hear more distinction between left and right and you may pick up some sounds you don't hear on speakers. You could probably mix 90% of the time with a good pair of headphones, but you will at some point have to hear your mix through speakers.  The sound editing tools found in Final Cut Pro, Premier and Avid will do basic effects but can't be relied on for anything complex.  These are your best options as they include advanced features to help in cleaning up sound but it is a steep learning curve.    Levels vs volume. Levels and volume differ in that if you turn the volume down your levels still bounce around. Levels are the objective levels of sound at which the audio has been or is being recorded. Levels vs loudness. Levels and loudness differ with loudness being a measurement of average voltage signal. Low frequencies could appear high on the meters but be barely audible to the hear, having a lower loudness. Likewise compressed sound may not seem high on meters but sound loud to the ear, and is used frequently on narration. Levels vs Decibels. Numbers on a meter are not decibels; they vary according to the type of meter.  There are two types of analogue meters (that use needles): a volume unit which can give you a good rough idea and is cheaper but less sensitive, than the peak program meter which provides more accurate readings and needle falls more slowly. Peak on these is between 4 and 5 and is more forgiving taking full volume to make this happen. Digital. You are more likely to use a digital meter, which is extremely accurate, but beware that digital sound is unforgiving when it comes to clip distortion when the level goes into the red. Digital audio should never exceed 0 dBFS on a digital meter.  Don't edit the video once you have started mixing the audio.  Keep levels consistent. This should be roughly around -12dB, but some parts may be slightly quieter.  With DSLRs more and more people are recording sound separately to the video. You can sync either manually by using a clapper board or using a piece of software such as Plural Eyes or Woo Wave which do it automatically.   Scene by scene. Work on one scene at a time, and work through each element separately. Atmosphere. Start by laying atmosphere tracks down; these should be continuous throughout. Prioritize. For each scene work out whether dialogue, special effects or music or sound fx is most important and mix this level first. Spotting. Go through the scene writing down what other sounds you need to find in a library or record. Play around. When you have mixed it so it is all at a constant level and feels continuous, you should think of the tonal quality of the sound.. For example the music and dialogue may be a similar pitch so they are clashing.  Note: Don't attempt extreme stereo effects or surround sound unless you are an experienced sound mixer with expensive equipment. It's best to stick with stereo or mono. When mixing keep your music as stereo and atmosphere as stereo but pan the rest so that they are central. If you have two characters talking to each other you could pan one to one side and the other to the other side, but don't go further than 50%.  Documentaries rely solely on sound in the form of interviews and narration to tell a story. It is very unusual to re-record anything in post so you have to record it well on set and do what you can to sweeten it in post. There may be fewer tracks in a documentary, but do not underestimate how long it takes to mix due to the sound problems you must deal with due to the guerrilla nature of a documentary.  Atmosphere. Ambient sound recorded on set is the first thing you lay down to smooth edits and may help if you are having problems with background sound. If you are clever you can create a sort of soundtrack from the atmosphere tracks.       Narration and interviews. You will want to have these as clean as possible, though you can do a little to improve them. In the worst case of sound that is poorly understood, add subtitles.       Music is a powerful tool in documentaries, but don't over use it. Remember silence can bring great tension.  You can also use it to show when a character's attention wanders by reducing the level of other voices.  Semi-detached. Sound off screen can create an enigma or cover an effect you couldn't afford to do visually on your budget.       Silence. Remember not to drown your audience out with sound, as silence is just as important and can be useful for tension when there is a sudden sound.  This is not a filter but is useful to put at the end of a track of audio to avoid pops. Echo/Reverb. You use this effect if you did not pick it up on location and for psychological effects.  Ask yourself how long a sound carries on in a location. For example if you clap your hands in a church then outside, the sound will seem to last longer in the church. This filter is used to match sounds you might have gotten from a library or recorded somewhere else to the location.   Equalizer. Think of it as a frequency specific volume controller. You use this to make different frequencies louder or quieter. It can be used to emphasize a voice and balance a recording. For example you may have recorded someone playing a piano but in the recording you mostly pick up the treble notes. Using the equalizer you can bring in more of the bass and mid-range notes. An equalizer can also be used if you just want the bass of the music, such as if the characters are outside a club. Here you would cut (lower) the high frequencies to create a realistic sound. Compression/Normalization. Dialogue varies in volume so a compressor is used to smooth out the loud bits which makes the dialogue seem closer and more intimate. This effect is used extensively on narration and whispering dialogue. Normalization is more harsh than a compressor and should not be used, unless the audio levels are too low to achieve the proper loudness even with compression. Notch filter. Notch filters are essentially equalizers set to remove specific problematic frequencies. You can get rid of continuous sounds such as fridge, camera, hum.  This helps you eliminate rumble and sounds such as unwanted footsteps, traffic and wind. Set it to roughly around 80 Hz.   Expander/noise gate. This filter softens noise below a certain level so as to remove some background sound. Noise removal. This filter is available in Soundtrack Pro and works by you selecting a quiet part of a clip with bad hiss or background sound then it will work on the whole clip. This filter produces varying results. Keyframes. Key frames is another way of making sound constant throughout a clip. Note: It is smart to listen to your sound on a wide range of devices before you master your film to see if any issues crop up.	Consider the different types of soundtrack:  Dialogue. Think about sounds before shoot, what can you record on set?  , Record good sound on set.  , Keep your volume level even or at the same level. Use good quality speakers. Keep in mind that headphones will result in a different sound than using speakers will. Choose a good editing suite. Choose a good sound mixing software such as Pro Tools, Soundtrack Pro, or Cubase. Consider the differences between levels, volume and loudness (and even decibels). Differentiate between and understand the two main metering types:   Analogue. Lock the picture. Remember that levels are additive so the more sounds you put in the timeline the higher your levels will be. Keep all of your devices synchronized with your DSLR. Approach documentaries in a slightly different way than narrative films. Use sound to draw attention to an object or person. Understand your basic filtering options:   Dissolve/Fade Out. Add some reverberation to the soundtrack of the film. Use a "High pass" setting in your audio to the film.
The best way to do this is by turning off the electricity supplied to the circuit on which you will be working at the junction box (also called a fuse box) for your home. Switch the breaker of your fuse-box so the fuse for the circuit supplying electricity to your fixture reads "Off."It's always a good idea to double-check the flow of electricity by checking the light itself before moving forward with this project. Flick the light on, and if the circuit has been disabled, the light should stay off.; , If the light you are wiring is in the ceiling, you should clean any cobwebs and dust before attempting to install your new fixture. The same is true for lights or switches in walls; a clean work area will improve your ease of installation.   If you are using a ladder to reach your light fixture, or are in a less than ideal position, be sure the ground is also clear of debris or anything else that might affect your balance or safety.  There is usually, but not always, a decorative globe, shield, or some kind of external feature covering your existing light fixture. This could also be something more involved, like ceiling fan blades., There will be a mounting bracket holding your old fixture in place. You will need to unscrew this from mounting bracket, usually with Phillips-head screwdriver, and then pull it from the bracket.   Be sure you support the old fixture with your hand as you unscrew it from the mount. If you do not support the fixture, it could fall to the floor once you loosen the screws holding it in.  Allow the unscrewed fixture you are supporting with your hand to descend a few inches below its mount. You will likely see three wires attached to your fixture: a hot wire, grounding wire, and neutral wire. You will need to use your free hand to uncouple these wires, twisting the wiring cap to free the wires from each other.   Hot wires are those that run electricity to your fixtures and grounding wires are intended to offer surge electricity a neutral point, like the earth, into which it can dissipate.In some cases, a grounding wire might be attached to the mounting bracket itself, rather than a house wire. This is fairly common in new light fixtures.  You should see plastic caps, called wiring caps (also called a wire nut), with two wires running into each cap. One wire will come from the light, the other from the main electrical circuit of your house. Disengage the wires by twisting the wiring cap until it comes free.Once you have released the light from its wiring, you can set the existing light fixture aside.  In most cases, the mounting hardware for your new fixture will fit the bracket that's already installed.You'll need to hold the new light fixture up to the existing mounting bracket and compare fasteners and size to make sure you don't need to install a new mounting bracket.  Oftentimes, if a light requires a special bracket, this will be included with the light you have bought. If not, you can look up the light information online by doing a general search of the name of the light fixture, which you can find on the box. Listed with its information should be mounting information as well.   Once you know the kind of bracket you need, you can find and purchase it at your local hardware store. Replacing the old bracket is just a matter of unscrewing it and screwing the new one into place.  This is especially important if you have an older home, in particular, any home built before 1985. Wiring installed prior to 1985 has weaker insulation than contemporary circuits, meaning the heat generated by your fixture could cause a short, fire, or worse.   Fixtures unsafe to use for older wiring will have a warning label that says, “Use wire rated for at least 90 degrees C.” Fixtures without this warning will still be suitable for your pre-1985 wiring., Depending on your country, the colors that code which wires are live, ground, and neutral may differ. In any case, you should support your new light with one hand and take each like colored wire coming from your wall or ceiling and combine it with its mate coming from the light fixture. Twist the exposed ends of the wire together, and seal it by screwing on a wiring cap. A general guide to electrical wiring color code is as follows:CA:Live - black (single phase), red (with a second hot wire)Neutral - whiteEarth/ground - green, green and yellow, or bare copper  UK:Live - brown, black, or redNeutral - blueEarth/ground - green and yellow  USA:Live - black (single phase), red (with second hot wire)Neutral - whiteEarth/ground - green, green and yellow, or bare copper, If there is a remaining wire that is green, green and yellow, or bare copper, you should screw it into place on the mounting hardware for your light fixture. There will likely be a small screw for this purpose on the fixture, which you can unscrew slightly, slot the wire into the gap between screw and fixture, and then tighten to fasten your ground.Be sure your ground wire feeds to a place it can safely disperse an electrical current. Many metal surfaces can be suitable for this purpose.  Continuing to support your fixture with your hand, hold it in place so as to line up the screw holes with those of the bracket and screw it into the mount using the hardware that came with the fixture.  There may be external features or parts, like a light cover or ceiling fan blades, to add to your new light fixture. Take a moment to step back and inspect your fixture for levelness, orientation, and flushness with the surface on which you've installed it. Some light fixtures are permanently angled a certain way, and improper installation can lead to your light shining where it does little good.  Return to your fuse-box and reset the fuse for the room in which you've been wiring to restore the flow of electricity to the room. Now you can install a light bulb and turn on the new light fixture you have installed to test it out., Sometimes, over the course of installation, a wire might be jostled or damaged in such a way as to compromise its ability to transmit electricity to your new light. Additionally, in some cases, contractors may have used different colored wires for your electrical setup. In both of these cases you should use a circuit tester to ensure you don't make a dangerous mistake with your wiring.   A circuit tester can be purchased at most hardware stores. Turn off the electricity, free the wire you are uncertain about from the old fixture, and then turn the electricity back on, being sure that your free wire is not touching anything dangerous. Your circuit tester will have two nodes; connect one to the questionable wire and the other to a grounded, metal surface or your ground wire. If the light on your tester turns on, the wire is hot and is supplied with electricity., Some wiring jobs are done haphazardly, with poorly managed wire in the fixture box or wall or ceiling where you are working. After turning off the circuit, hold up your fixture to your mount to approximate how much wire you will need.   Be sure to leave some excess. Wire can become damaged or get brittle over time, in which case, you might want to strip some insulation off the wire to tie a new fixture in to your circuit.  If you are working with older wire, or if the stripped part of the wire is difficult to work with, after you have cut power to the circuit you are working on, you can strip more wire for greater ease of handling.   It is recommended that you remove about ½" of wire insulation with a wire stripper or a utility knife. Be sure you exercise care when using a utility knife; you don't want to nick or damage the metal part of your wire., If you have a friend of family member available to assist, it can help a great deal to have this person hold the fixture while you're wiring. If you do not have help available, you can bend a piece of unused scrap wire to hang the light securely from the mount. With the fixture secured, you should be able to use both hands, making the wiring portion a cinch.An assistant is especially helpful when you are wiring a ceiling light. While you are on a ladder or chair, your helper can hold you steady, hand you tools and parts, and take unneeded parts from you as you finish.	Cut power to your circuit. Clean the old fixture and installation area. Remove the old fixture covering. Unmount the fixture. Lower the fixture. Disengage your light from its wires. Check for compatibility. Swap in a new bracket, if necessary. Investigate the age of your wiring. Join like colored wires. Ground your fixture. Fasten your fixture in the mounting bracket. Finish any supplemental installation. Test your new light. Test for electrical current. Create space to work. Give yourself more wire. Give yourself another hand while wiring.
If you'd like the blanket to be double-sided, cut two pieces of fleece instead: one that is solid-colored, and one that is patterned.  Trace the corners first using a pen, then cut the corners out using a sharp pair of scissors.Not only does this give your blanket a unique touch, but you won't have to sew Mildred corners when adding the bias tape.   You can also use a plate or a lid.  Unless you made your own bias tape, or bought it already the right length, you will have to sew two or more lengths of bias tape together to make one long, continuous strand.Open up both ends of the bias tape, then pin them together, with the wrong sides facing out. Sew the two strands together using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.  Nestle the raw edge of the blanket right into the fold of the bias tape. Place a sewing pin ever 3 inches (7.62 centimeters)., Trim off the excess bias tape until you have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) left. Overlap it by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then fold the excess under itself. Press it flat with an iron, then pin it in place.  Remove the pins as you sew.  Go over your blanket and double-check for any missed pins, then carefully trim off any loose threads. Your blanket is now complete, and ready to use!	Cut a 36 by 36-inch (91.44 by 91.44-centimeter) piece of fleece. Use a bowl to trace and cut rounded edges onto the corners of your blanket. Sew the bias tape together, if needed. Pin the bias tape all the way around the edge of the blanket. Fold the end of the bias tape under itself to conceal the raw edge. Sew around the bias tape, using a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance.Use a thread color that matches the bias tape. Finish the blanket.
Give your audience the feeling of being let in on a secret, whilst also giving you a way to vent.  You can also write them both at the same time, which can be much easier. Whichever you write second is likely to be harder because you have to fit it to the other part you wrote, so save your particular talent until second.   Some pretty well-know artists start with the melody, and then find the right words to fit. There's one song everybody knows that started out with only a melody. As the song was developed, the artist sang "Scrambled eggs..." When he was finished, Paul McCartney had written "Yesterday." This is also a favorite technique of Peter Gabriel, who frequently uses nonsense syllables as he works out the melody, adding actual words only when the music has been decided on.  Write as many ideas down as possible and words that relate to it (especially useful if you want to make your lyrics rhyme). Write as much detail as possible—remember it might not all go into your final lyrics. Express yourself!  , Sing it to yourself to make sure that the rhythm and words are together.  The Arctic Monkeys have managed to rhyme "something" with "stomach" (summat, stomach).   While making words with different endings rhyme, and making dissimilar words flow is a definite plus, do not overdo this. You can use regional sayings or phrases. This tends to make the piece sound native to a specific area. Also, a common thing for British bands is to use the accent to their advantage—like South Central Heroes—and this can create a very unique beat. However, there is no need to fake an accent or dialect just to make your song sound "unique."  , Maybe you could have lots of repeated lines, an unconventional rhyming scheme or a range of very short and very long lines.  Pay attention to how people around you talk and what they talk about. You could base your lyrics around this.  Make your song deeper and more interesting by using similes, metaphors and other literary devices.  Include things that are funny or make references to current affairs and trends as people tend to remember them more. They also tend to date a song, and what began as a serious song can be seen as dated or even campy a few years down the line.  Make sure it is relevant to your lyrics, but if it's only tangentially related, or just downright obscure, don't worry too much about it. Dylan's Rainy Day Women No. 12 and 35 means absolutely nothing to mere mortals (and perhaps not even to Mr. Dylan), but when he wrote that song, Everybody Must Get Stoned was not a title that would get any airplay or juke box positioning.   Be careful of overly-long names, like Joan Miro's Procession Through The Insides Of A Purple Antelope Across A Sea Of Tuna Fish by Adrian Belew. If you make your song name really long, people will either gloss over it (bad), make up their own name for it (risky), or it'll become a cult favorite simply because of the name. If the muse moves you to it, follow your muse.	Make your song deeply personal. Decide how you want to write your song: tune first or lyrics first. List things that you might want to say in your lyrics. Start with the chorus. Write in accent and dialect, but keep it natural. Think of an unusual rhythm for your lyrics. Listen carefully. Be literary. Be humorous. Create a thought-provoking title.
These situations are more likely to erupt into violence, so it is best to stay away from them.   If you spot a crowd of people, turn away and take a different route to your destination.  Police scanner apps can helpful during times of civil unrest.You can download a police scanner app and listen to it to determine what areas of your city you should avoid. This can be especially helpful if you need to go out or if you are trying to find the safest way out of the city.   Check the app before you download it to make sure that it is compatible with police scanners in your country.  If you need to leave your home to purchase something necessary, such as food, then make sure that you only carry enough cash to make the purchase.Don’t bring all of your credit cards along with you when you go out.   If you do not have any cash, then you may want to try to get to an ATM as soon as possible to withdraw some of your money.  A knife that you can easily conceal or some pepper spray is a good option.   Try to avoid or deescalate a potential conflict before getting out your knife or pepper spray; the presence of a weapon may cause increased aggression.	Steer clear of heavily populated areas and crowds.Avoid demonstrations, rallies, and other situations where lots of people might be present. Download a police scanner app. Carry limited cash. Arm yourself with a knife or pepper spray.If you are concerned about your safety, then you may want to carry some form of protection when you go out.
The type you can get from a dollar store or a craft store are ideal. It needs to be tall enough to hang your bracelets from., Try to find a dowel thick enough to cover the hole in your candlestick. You may need to cut it down to the right length.If you can't find a wooden dowel, stuff a rolled up magazine into a paper towel tube, and use that instead.  Measure across the dowel with a ruler, and make a mark in the center. Don't worry, you don't see the mark once you are done painting.  Make sure the line is going from side to side. The candle hole will interrupt your line. You can use wood glue, tacky glue, or an industrial strength glue for this.  Make sure that the mark you made earlier is right in the middle of the candle hole. Try to center the dowel on top of the candlestick as much as possible. If you see any excess glue, wipe it off quickly with a damp paper towel.  Once the glue dries, you can strengthen your holder by filling the seam between the dowel and the candlestick with more glue.  Take the bracelet holder to a well-ventilated area and protect your work surface with newspaper. Shake a can of spray paint, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the coat to dry, then apply a second one, if necessary. Most spray paints will dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours.   It is better to apply your paint in many thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will give you a smoother finish and prevent any drips or puddles. You can also prime your holder first using a spray on primer. Choose white for a light color, and black or grey for a dark color.  Once the paint dries, shake a can of some acrylic sealer, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the sealer to dry, then apply a second coat. Avoid applying the sealer too thickly, or you will get drips and puddles. Most sealers will take about 2 hours to dry; some will also require a curing time, which will be specified on the can.   Choose a glossy finish if you want your holder to be shiny. Choose a matte finish if you don't want it to be shiny.  Once your holder dries, it is ready to go. You can leave it as it is, or embellish it further to better match your room decor. You can use hot glue or super glue to attach these embellishments. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Glue a pretty button or bead to each end of the dowel. Try to choose a bead or button that is the same diameter. Glue some small pearls, beads, or silk flowers around the top edge of the candlestick. Glue a large bead or ornament on top of the holder, right in the center. Wrap ribbon around the dowel in a spiral.	Choose a wooden candlestick. Choose a thick, wooden dowel that is about 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.48 centimeters) long. Find the center of the dowel and mark it with a pen or pencil. Draw a line of glue across the top center of the candlestick. Press the dowel down into the glue. Wait for the glue to dry. Spray paint the bracelet holder. Spray the holder with an acrylic sealer and let it dry. Consider embellishing your holder.
One vital step is to make sure the phone and case are the right fit. One of the only ways to do this is to bring your phone along with you and “test drive” cases/purses you like.  You want to check out the coin purse and wallet area for your purchase.  Just because you have a certain design or style in mind doesn’t mean that you can’t change if you see something else. Be open to new devices for the phone pursue such as using a small draw sting bag or even a wallet.  Be mindful of how much money you are spending on the purse, even if money is no object. Look for discounts or markdowns--also consider shopping at a retail outlet.  Even though you may intend to carry the iPhone purse in your briefcase, try it out in the event the particular case you chose doesn’t fit or doesn’t look good.	Bring your iPhone along for the shopping trip. Head to the purse section of the retail store. Keep an open mind about what you will buy. Consider price. Test how you will carry the purse.
Go to the craft store keeping in mind the kind of sewing projects that your friend likes to do and the colors that he or she uses. Choose some of the following items to place in the sewing kit:  10 or more unique matching buttons. Paper flowers or crocheted flowers. Spools of attractive ribbons. Spools of colorful thread. Striped twine. Creative masking tape or stickers. Grid paper that can be cut into circles or shapes. Needles, a small pincushion and pins.  Then consider the rest of the sewing kit and decide how to attractively fit all of the contents in the jar. Place the needles and pins near the bottom so that they do not hurt anyone during transportation., If it does not fit, you can simply use the pincushion as the lid. If not, place a piece of fabric over the top and tie it on with striped twine., Your crafty friend will appreciate that these sometimes expensive items can now be part of her craft stash.	Empty and clean a large glass jar, such as a large jam jar or a ketchup bottle. Wrap the spools of ribbon around wooden clothespins to help them fit into the glass jar better. Stick the pincushion on top and screw the top on the jar. Make a label that says something like "Kimberley's Sewing Kit," and glue it to the jar or tie it to the top.
Instead of haphazardly throwing a bunch of filling into the tube, thinking about how you want the necklace to appear and what look you hope to achieve. Perhaps draw the design on paper.  This should be done based on personal preference and overall fashion goals.   Use other necklaces to help you determine the length of your necklace. While other necklaces won’t lay the same way, using other pieces of jewelry as your guide can give you somewhat of an idea of how long you’d like the tubing to be. Remember that plastic tubing does not lay the same way as chains or pearls so keep that in mind when styling longer necklaces.  Slide the thin, metal nail through the top of the cord end with the head portion facing the bottom.   Cut the thin metal nail approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) from the top once it’s fully threaded through the cord end. Use wire cutters if your scissors can’t cut through the metal. Bend the metal nail backward and into the top of the cord end so you create a loop.  This will provide a barrier at the end and prepare the tube for filling.   Allow the glued cord end ample amount of time to dry before filling. If it is still wet, the cord end could become unglued after being filled, creating a mess.  This may take some time as you will want to be neat and tidy when adding glitter or stones.   Consider using a small funnel to guide filling neatly into the plastic tubing. If you don’t own a small funnel, simply create one from a piece of paper by rolling it sideways and then placing the smaller end into the top of the tube.  This time you may want to add a clasp. The easiest way to add the clasp is to slide it through the cord end loop as you create it. Before you bend the thin metal nail backwards to create the loop, slide the clasp through the nail and then bend the nail into the loop.	Visualize how the necklace will look when you are finished. Cut the tubing to desired size. Create the cord end loop if it does not come pre-looped. Glue the cord end on one side of the plastic tubing. Fill the necklace with desired pieces. Close the open end with another cord end. Finished.
This ensures waste water won't freeze in the tanks. Follow up with a sewer hose rinse to prevent existing solid and liquid waste from solidifying in the hose.  An open gray water valve enables overnight waste to flow into the septic system instead of filling up your tanks. Closing the black water valve prevents excessive odors.  This is to allow for a slow, steady drip of water and ensures water won't freeze because it's moving through the supply lines at all times. Avoid wasting water--wait until bedtime to leave faucets open.	Empty your gray and black water holding tanks. Leave the valve open for your RV grey water tank, but close the black water valve. Open your kitchen and bathroom faucets. Ensure all sink drains are open to avoid a flood.
All lawns have an ideal grass height that promotes healthy growth. Depending on climate and geography, your ideal grass height is between 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) and 3 inches (7.62 cm).   Talk to a landscaping expert or a professional at your local home and garden retailer to get an understanding of the type of grass you have and how high it should grow. Keep grass a little bit longer when in doubt. This will provide shade to your lawn, depriving potential weeds of sunlight.; , This will eliminate weed heads before they are allowed to mature or germinate in your lawn.   Use a weed whacker or a trimmer on the weeds that grow at the edge of your lawn every time you mow.  The cover will keep the ground cool and deprived of sunlight, discouraging the growth of new weeds.	Determine the ideal height of your grass. Mow your lawn as regularly as necessary to keep grass at its ideal height. Spread stones or mulch around your flower beds to prevent weeds from growing.
The different plant habits are upright, mounding, and trailing. You can use all three types of plants in your container.   One idea is to use a tall plant in the middle for the focal point, mounding plants to put around the focal point, and trailing plants to hang over the edges.Other terms used are “thriller,” “filler,” and “spiller.” Thrillers refer to the upright habits, fillers, refer to the mounding, and spiller refers to the trailing plants.  You could put plants together that are all somewhat similar in size. You could also group plants together in a range of sizes that complement one another. For example, tall sunflowers could be in the same container with medium-height zinnias and small daises. You could use filler like baby's breath to round out the variety.  Be creative and don’t be afraid to use plants of a variety of textures for the fillers and spillers. This will generally make the design look more natural and less contrived. For example, sweet potato vine is leafy and bright, creating a thick texture. You could contrast this with a brightly colored thriller, such as a bird of paradise. Ornamental grasses are also a good choice; they come in many different sizes, colors, and growth habits.  Try planting a variety of herbs, since they have different textures, grow well together, look attractive and all share a similar function. You could also arrange different kinds of flowers in containers. Choose flowers with a variety of petal colors -- they could complement (or contrast) with one another.   For example, you could group a variety of herbs like lavender, thyme, basil, catnip and rosemary together. If you wanted to try something visually appealing with flowers, try a few different types of blooms in a range of shades. For instance, for a purple theme, you could plant violets, purple pansies, irises, bell heather, verbena and lavender.	Arrange plants according to their “habit.” There are different ways to organize the plants within each container, usually according to size and habit. Arrange plants according to their size. Experiment with different textures. Arrange plants by function or color.
For most guitarists, the easiest way to do this is with a guitar tuner. These devices are available at most music stores. Set your tuner according to the string you are tuning, play that string, and the tuner will indicate whether you are sharp or flat. Adjust the tuning peg by twisting it to raise flat notes and lower sharp notes until your tuner indicates the note is in tune.   You can also use a tuning fork, a pitch pipe, or some other instrument that is already in tune to tune your guitar. Play the instrument of each string and tune the strings one at a time until they are perfectly in tune with the note played by the tuning fork, pitch pipe, or tuned instrument.; , In reggae, the strumming generally is on the offbeat. The offbeat is on the "and" that occurs in between the beats of a 4:4 time signature song. So if you're counting the beats "1... 2... 3... 4," imagine an "and" in between each main beat. This is the offbeat.   A simple reggae strum pattern uses a down-strum on the "and" like "1 (and) 2 (and) 3 (and) 4 (and) 1..." Your first strum should be a down-strum.There are some exceptions to the "play on the offbeat" rule. Music is largely about conveying a sense of feeling or getting into a groove. The strumming of the strings is referred to by many different names in reggae. Some call it a "chop," "skank," or "bang.", This is the second most common strum pattern in reggae music. Once you down-strum on the offbeat, draw your hand back across the strings upwards in an up-strum.   Once you are more experienced with reggae, you may be able to alternate between playing down-strums and down-up strums, but while learning it may be easiest to stick with one at a time. Another common strum pattern is to single strum on the first offbeat and then do a down-up strum on the second offbeat., Use firm pressure with your left hand on the fretboard to lessen the sound produced in the strings while strumming. This will create a quality of sound that's called "chicken scratch" in funk music.By muting the strings and focusing on the strum pattern, it's likely you'll pick up the groove of reggae music more quickly.  Pick one of your favorite reggae songs and listen to it to get a feel for the rhythm. Then play the song a second time, only this time strum in time with the chords that are played in the recording. Don't worry if you don't know the chords that are being played. This exercise is just to help you get a feel for the rhythm.Again, you may find it easiest to strum along with the song you have chosen by muting the strings with firm pressure in your left hand across the fretboard. This way, you won't be distracted by the sound and can focus on matching the rhythm.  Now that you've gotten the hang of the basic strum patters reggae, you can start working on getting the right sound out of your strings. This requires the right amount of pressure on the strings on the fretboard with your left hand. To get a feel for the effect your left hand pressure has on the sound of your guitar, play chords in reggae rhythm and adjust the pressure in your left hand as you play.Try playing chords with while using extremely light pressure, moderate pressure, heavy pressure with your left hand on the strings. Your left hand affects the sound of the strum of your chords not just by pressure on the strings but also duration. While using different levels of pressure, experiment with pressure duration. For example, you might use moderate pressure at the onset followed by the release of your left hand.  Staccato is a musical term that means notes are played in a clipped, detached fashion from other notes. This quality can be produced by applying quick pressure to the strings with your left hand followed immediately by a sudden release., In reggae, the stuck line is the guitar part that follows along with the bass guitar. This part is generally muted to give a mellow tone to the acoustic accompaniment of the bass.Use moderate pressure with your left hand on your fretboard when playing the stuck line.  Finger pick the notes of the stuck line to create a distinct sound in the notes.  Try to do this especially with bar chords that extend across the entire fret, like A major. Bar chords are where your finger covers the entire fret. Keep your playing arm loose and swing it down to strum your hand over all strings, from the first to the last.Many times, beginning guitarists will approach the strings on an angle with their right hand. This kind of technique can lead to missed strings in the strum. You can play reggae with a three or four string strum, but using all five is recommended. This will give you a fuller sound in your playing. The rhythm of the music is more important than hitting all the strings. As the rhythm becomes easier, you can shift your focus to hitting all the strings., If you play your guitar stiffly, you'll probably notice the sound of your guitar reflect this, causing your guitar to sound too mechanical and stiff for reggae. Try to get into the groove of the music by swaying gently or bobbing along with the rhythm.Your guitar should bounce slightly with your left hand as you push the sound out by drawing your right hand across the strings.  You can use both major and minor chords as you practice. You should choose chords and chord progressions that fit with the song you are trying to play. For example, you might try a 3-chord progression of the main chords of the song you are practicing.At first, look through the music and pick chords that come easy to you and sound the best together. Then try linking these with more difficult chords. Take your time connecting the chords together slowly and fluidly. This is a good opportunity for you to practice and learn the song inside and out. Once you are more comfortable, choose more complex chords and variations to put your own flavor on the sound.  Some well known reggae musicians you might want to listen to include Bob Marley and the Wailers, Prince Buster, and Jackie Mittoo. Note how these performers play their songs and try to emulate it.   You can look up the chords or the tabs for many of the songs played by professional musicians online. This way you don't have to guess at which chord is being played.	Tune your guitar. Play the chords of your reggae song on the off beats. Use a down-up stroke on the offbeat. Mute the strings and practice strumming. Strum along with a song. Adjust the pressure while strumming. Make your notes staccato. Mute the stuck line when playing in an ensemble. Strum in a harmonic, percussive fashion. Groove with the rhythm of the music. Alternate your chords. Imitate the reggae masters.
You'll be able to come up with more interesting and varied notes for your solo if you base your solo off chords. Chords change much more frequently throughout a song than keys, meaning your chord based solo will likely have a greater variety of notes than a key based one.You may want to go through your song and write the chords for each bar of music if this information isn't already there.  Now that your chords are written out, you can play scales or arpeggios in the key of those chords to create a complementary sounding solo. When the chord changes, change the scale or arpeggio you are playing to match the key of the new chord.Keys with the same number accidentals or keys different by only a single accidental on the Circle of Fifths are generally harmonious., You can think of the root of a chord as its most central tone. By playing the root of the chord throughout your solo, weaving it into scales, arpeggios, and more, your solo will sound more tonally centered and harmonic.The letter name of each chord generally indicates its root. For example, a Gmaj7 chord has a root of G, an F#min chord has the root of F#., Voice leading is a common soloing technique. It involves playing a note (or notes) either a half or whole step away from the root of the next chord, before that next chord is played.   The notes surrounding the root of your next chord will resolve to that root. When you play the next chord, this technique creates a natural kind of transition between chords.	Break your song into chords. Solo by soloing according to the chord. Emphasize the root note of the chord in your solo. Voice lead into the root of your next chord.
If your fruit trees have been disturbed by an animal in the past, there is likely a route that the animal habitually takes to gorge on your plants. Places like a hole in your fence, a well-worn path leading from the garden, or entrances leading to a burrow are obvious signs of a known route. Set your trap up on these routes to maximize the chance that you'll catch it.You can maximize your chances of catching a burrowing animal by setting the trap up directly at the entrance of the hole.  A human scent on a trap can act as a deterrent for most animals and can prevent you from successfully trapping your animal. There are two main ways that you can mask your scent on the trap that you plan on using. One way is to wash the trap with a mild soap, then immerse it in boiling water to remove your scent. Another way to mask your scent is by leaving the trap outdoors in the sunshine for several days. Moving your trap outdoors will make the trap smell like the surrounding environment., Animals like chipmunks, squirrels, and rabbits will usually exhibit signs such as biting off large parts of the plant, eating an entire plant to the ground, or the removing and damaging individual fruit. Look for these signs to verify that your plants are being eaten by a mammal and not insects. Knowing which animal is eating your plant will help you get the right bait and appropriately sized trap. Monitor your plants and see which animals are pestering them.If you can't determine what animal is eating your fruit plants, you can set up hidden cameras to catch the animals in the act. If your plants are slowly being eaten away and there are small holes all over your fruit, chances are that insects have been eating it.  Different animals prefer different foods and will be attracted to different baits. For example, rabbits prefer foods like apples, carrots, pea pods, peppermint, or cider sprayed over the trap while raccoons enjoy sugar filled foods like marshmallows as well as different kinds of fish. Use the right bait for the animal that is eating your fruit plants. Opossums eat marshmallows, apples, melons, other fruit. Skunks prefer chicken, fish, and bacon. Squirrels enjoy nuts, seeds, and peanut butter.  A loose cage on the ground can be tipped over or manipulated by the animal in your yard. The doors on most live traps will only stay closed when the trap is sitting upright. To keep your trap standing upright, shove a metal rod through the trap into the ground to hold it in place. Alternatively, you could strap the trap to a tree or pile of rocks to secure it. Make sure that the trap is secure and won't fall over if an animal gets caught in it., Since all of these traps are no-kill traps, the final step in your animal trapping journey is to release them into the wild. Take the animal to a park or forest and carefully tip the trap to release it. Wild animals, even smaller mammals can be dangerous or carry disease, so be incredibly careful when releasing the critter. Confirm with your local park department if it's okay to release the animal you've trapped before you release it. If it's not authorized, then call animal control to come to your house to remove the animal.Wear thick construction gloves to protect your fingers from animal bites when handling the trap.	Set the trap in a known animal route. Mask your scent on the trap. Determine what animal is eating your fruit. Lay the appropriate bait in your trap. Set the trap up so it stands upright. Release the animal in a forest or park.
Fantasy films can be hard to categorize, as they can overlap with other genres. Usually, though, they feature supernatural forces, alien species, magic, and entities that can wield said magic.  Movies like this have many different characters, and often feature sprawling worlds for the characters to inhabit. Popular films like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Hobbit franchises fall into this category.  These typically feature a whimsical setting, unambiguously moral characters, and the famous happily ever after ending. Shrek is a fairy tale movie.  This is called a contemporary fantasy. The Harry Potter series is one such example.  This an urban fantasy film. Movies such as Nightbreed and Nightwatch are in this sub-genre.   The urban fantasy sub-genre is like "genreception", since it's technically a sub-genre of contemporary fantasy.  If you do notice any, you're probably watching a dark fantasy movie. Films like Pan's Labyrinth and Edward Scissorhands fall into this category.  Use movies like Conan the Barbarian and Deathstalker as a reference.	Identify fantasy films. Identify High Fantasy films. Identify fairy tales. Identify whether the movie has fantasy elements but takes place in modern day. Notice if the fantastical elements take place in a city, whether from the future, past, or modern day. Notice any dark themes within the fantasy movie. Notice if the film is a sword and sorcery movie.
Thoroughly wash the entire plate with hot, soapy water, then dry the dish completely with a clean dish towel.   The adhesive may not stick to a plate well enough if there is any dirt, grime, or oil on the back of that plate. For best results, use a scouring pad on the back of the plate in the general area the disc will be placed on. Adhesive plate hangers work especially well with plates that are strangely shaped or plates with notably thick rims. You can use them with any shape or size, though.  Adhesive plate hangers come in five basic sizes. Make sure that you choose a hanger size that will work for your specific plate.   The five sizes are:  1-1/4 inch (3 cm), for plates up to 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter 2 inches (5 cm), for plates up to 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter 3 inches (7.5 cm), for plates up to 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter 4 inches (10 cm), for plates up to 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter 5-1/2 inches (14 cm), for plates up to 6.5 lbs (3 kg) in weight    , Dip your fingertip in a little water, then rub your wet finger over the adhesive side of the disc. Wait three to seven minutes, or until the adhesive becomes sticky.  Look at the front of the plate to determine how you want the dish to hang. Once you determine where the center top will be, press the adhesive side of the disc firmly onto the back of the plate at the center top.   Press firmly over the entire adhesive disc to ensure a tight seal. You should let the adhesive dry overnight before you hang the plate. Test the bond by gently tugging on the hook. If the disc starts to peel away, the bond is not strong enough. If the disc stays firmly attached to the plate, however, it should be safe to use.  Figure out where you want the plate to hang and lightly mark that spot with pencil. Hammer a nail into that spot. At least half the nail should be inside the wall, but there should be enough nail hanging outside of the wall for the plate hook to rest on.   Make sure that the nail you use has a large head to "catch" the hook on so that the plate will not fall off. Alternatively, use a picture hanger instead of a plain nail. Determine where you want the plate by holding it against the wall. Mark the top of the plate on the wall using a light pencil mark.  Set the plate down. Measure the distance between the hanger hook and the top of the plate, then mark out that same distance from the mark on your wall. Hammer the nail into the second mark you made.  Gently hang the hook on the nail in the wall. Step back and take a look. If you are satisfied with the results, the process is now complete.   If the plate seems crooked, you will need to remove the hanger start over. If you ever need to remove the hanger, you can do so by soaking the entire contraption--both plate and hanger--in water. After a few minutes, the adhesive should wear away, allowing you to remove it from the back of the plate.	Clean the plate. Choose the right size hanger. Wet the disc. Attach the disc to the back of the plate. Hammer a nail into the wall. Hang the plate.
When shopping for new ballet slippers, don't be tempted to buy the ones that fit with room to spare, get a size down and stretch them to fit your foot exactly. Buy a pair of leather ballet shoes in a size lower than your normal size. , It should be very very tight, even painfully so.  Cover every part.  Push it until it stretches as far as it will go. , Pull your ballet slippers on––it will be a bit of a challenge, but persevere. Put on another pair of socks over the shoes. , Repeat the whole process a few hours later, and leave in a warm place each time.  Mark where to put elastics on, then take off and sew them in.  In about a week's time they will soften and mould exactly to your feet, leaving perfect fitting ballet shoes that will last you for ages.	Get a size smaller than usual for this method. Take off any elastic straps on the ballet shoes.  , Try to fit the shoe on your foot. Using rescue oil or bio-oil, rub the full leather exterior of the shoe. Get a wooden spoon, and push it into the toe part of the shoe. Do the same for the heel of the shoe.  , Whilst the shoe is oily still, put on two pairs of thick socks. Walk around in the shoes for an hour or two, until they are dry.  , Place the shoes in a warm place. With one pair of socks on, slip on the shoe. Wear your shoes all the time when you're at home.
One flower that looks lovely in ribbon is the poinsettia. To create your ribbon poinsettias, you will need a variety of supplies, including:1.5-inch (3.8-cm) wide velvet or satin ribbon in red, pink, white, and green Scissors Two long sewing pins Thread 24-gauge wire Wire cutters Hot glue gun and glue Gold rhinestones; , Start by making a single red poinsettia. To make it, you will need strips of green ribbon for the leaves, plus longer and shorter strips of red ribbon for the flower. Cut out:   Three four-inch (10 cm) strips of red ribbon Two two-inch (5 cm) strips of red ribbon Two six-inch (15 cm) strips of green ribbon  , With each piece of ribbon, you need both ends to come to a point, rather than being squared. Fold each piece of ribbon in half lengthwise. To make the pointed ends:At one end, cut from the tip of the folded edge downward at a 45-degree angle. Repeat on the other side. Open the fold, and the ribbon will have a triangular edge. Repeat with each piece of ribbon.  With each piece of red ribbon, you need to create a few folds to give the ribbon a more flower-like shape. To fold the ribbon strips, you need to:Fold the ribbon in half lengthwise, so the velvet sides are touching. Press down with your finger to make a crease in the ribbon. On one side, fold the ribbon in half again the other way to expose the velvet side, and make a crease. Repeat on the other side. Pinch the ribbon in the center and flare out the ribbon on either side. Pierce the ribbon through the middle of all three folds with the sewing pin. Do this with all three long strips, and pierce them all with the same pin. Repeat with the smaller red ribbon strips, but pierce them with the second pin.  Start with the longer red strips. Unwrap a length of wire from the spool and wrap it around the center points twice, right beside where the pin is. Remove the pin.You should now have six red flower petals. With the same length of wire, wrap the wire around the base of each petal once. This will help to separate the petals and keep them in place. When you have wrapped the base of each petal with wire, cut the wire with the wire cutter. Repeat these steps with the smaller red ribbon strips. You will end up with a smaller flower with two petals.  These two flowers will actually be glued together to create a single flower, because poinsettias have layers of larger and smaller flower petals. Plug in your hot glue gun.   When the glue is ready, place a pea-sized dab of glue at the center front (the velvet side) of the larger flower. Center the smaller flower over top of this and press it into the glue so that both velvet sides are facing up and the center wire bands match up., With the green ribbon strips, fold each piece in half lengthwise with the velvet sides touching. Make a crease in the ribbon. Pinch the center of each ribbon and criss-cross the strips so they make an X. Open up the ends of the ribbon.   With a new length of wire, attach the two pieces of ribbon together by wrapping the wire around horizontally and then vertically around the meeting point. When you have finished wrapping the leaves, wrap the wire around to the back (shiny side) of the ribbon and leave a four-inch (10 cm) stem of wire before cutting.  Place a pea-sized dab of glue at the center of the green ribbons. Center the red ribbon flower over this and press it into the glue.   To make the stamen at the center of the flower, place three or four small dots of glue into the center of the flower, and affix a gold rhinestone to each dab.  Repeat these steps to make more red, white, and pink poinsettia flowers with green leaves. You will need about 10 to make a basic garland.  To make your garland, you can affix the ribbon flowers to a premade garland. Check craft stores, hobby stores, Christmas stores, or online for a base.Garland bases are usually real or synthetic evergreen boughs that are made from or designed to mimic pine, fir, and other coniferous trees. Synthetic garlands will last much longer than ones made from real trees.  There are a number of ways that you can decorate the garland with your flowers, and how you do it is a matter of personal preference. You can put the flowers on:   In a straight line So that they cover the garland base In a zig-zag pattern With one at each end and one in the center  , When you’ve decided how you want to arrange the flowers on the garland, you can attach them properly. Take the wire stem from the leaves and wrap it around the entire garland base or just a few sprigs on the garland. Once you’ve attached the flower, fluff the garland so there aren't any bare spots.   If you didn’t leave a wire stem on your flowers, you can also affix the flowers with florist’s tape or with a needle and thread., There are many different flowers you can make with ribbon, including the ever-popular rose. To make these roses, you'll need 36 inches (91 cm) of florist’s ribbon or satin ribbon that’s 1.25 inches (3 cm) wide. You'll also need a measuring tape, tweezers, and thread or wire to secure the ribbon ends.Lay the ribbon flat on a table. Measure three inches (7.5 cm) in from one of the ends. At that point, make a 45-degree fold toward you, so that the ribbon forms an upside down L. Make a crease to secure the fold. Turn the ribbon 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction. Make another 45-degree fold toward you. Continue turning the ribbon 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise fashion and making a 45-degree fold. It will look like you're folding the ribbon into a small square. Stop when you have folded all but a three-inch (7.5-cm) tail at either end of the ribbon. At the end of the ribbon where you finished, trim the end to create a point. Push the end of the tweezers through the center of the squares from the bottom. Place the pointed end of the ribbon in between the tweezer prongs. Apply pressure to the tweezers as you pull the pointed end of the ribbon through the center of the squares and out the bottom. Continue pulling until you have a two-inch (five-cm) tail coming through the center. Hold on to the ribbon tail you pulled through the center, and gently spin the ribbon around in a counter-clockwise direction. As you do this, the ribbon squares will twist around the center, forming petals. Continue twisting until all the layers of ribbon squares have twisted into a rose shape. On the underside, hold the two ribbon ends together and secure them together with a needle and thread or wire wrap before trimming the excess.  Daisies are another popular flower that you can make with ribbon, and there are a wide variety of ribbon colors you can use to make these daisies. All you need for this project is 60 inches (152 cm) of satin ribbon that’s five-eights of an inch (1.6 cm) wide, scissors, a needle and thread, hot glue, and a rhinestone or gem for the center of the flower.Pinch one end of the ribbon between your thumb and forefinger. Measure out a piece of ribbon that’s 1.5 to two inches (3.8 to five cm) in length, then fold the ribbon back on itself to make a loop. Pinch the ribbon between your same thumb and forefinger to keep the loop secure. Continue making loops in the ribbon like this, stacking them on top of each other like accordion folds. You should make at least 10 to 15 loops, because each of these will become a flower petal. When you’ve made all the loops you want, use the needle and thread to secure the loops together. Place a few stitches on the bottom left corner of the loops (under where your thumb and forefinger were pinching the ribbon). Gradually fan out the ribbon loops so they make a complete circle like a flower. Adjust the loops so they are evenly distributed around the circle. When you're finished, turn the flower over to the side without the stitching. Place a pea-sized dab of hot glue in the center of the flower and secure a pearl, gem, or rhinestone.  Carnations are popular flowers for events like Mother’s Day, so a ribbon carnation is a lovely project if you want to make a ribbon flower wreath, broach, hair piece, or other craft. For this flower, you need 4.4 yards (400 meters) of wire-edged ribbon that’s one inch (25 cm) wide. You'll also need a needle, thread, and a pair of scissors.Take one end of the ribbon and push back the ribbon to expose the wire within. Gently tug the wire away from the ribbon. As you do so, slide the ribbon down the wire in the opposite direction, so it gathers toward the middle of the ribbon. Continue sliding the ribbon down the wire until you’ve gathered the entire piece down to about 30 inches (75 cm). Trim off the excess wire, leaving a one-inch (2.5-cm) tail. Tie a knot in the end of the ribbon where the wire is exposed, making sure to gather the wire end into the knot as well. Using the knot as the center of the flower, gradually wind the ribbon around the center knot, being sure that the gathered edge of the ribbon is exposed at the top. After every few laps around the knot, stop to put a few stitches into the ribbon on the underside to secure it in place. Continue wrapping the ribbon around the center and stitching every few wraps to secure the ribbon. When you get to the end of the ribbon, tie a knot that incorporates the wire inside as well. Trim off the excess ribbon from the knots at both ends, being careful not to cut the knots themselves. Finish wrapping the last layer of ribbon, and use the needle and thread to stitch it in place. Turn the flower to the right side and use your finger tips to gently pull and fluff out the gathers to fill out the flower.	Gather your supplies. Cut your ribbon. Trim the ribbon ends. Fold the red ribbon strips. Assemble the flowers. Attach the flowers. Make the leaves. Finish the flower. Make enough flowers for a garland. Find a garland base. Position the flowers on the garland. Affix the flowers to the garland. Create ribbon roses. Make daisies from ribbon. Put together a ribbon carnation.
Blotting is best done with a book that has not been completely waterlogged. If your book has encountered a spill or fallen into a puddle, pick it up by its spine, and shake any remaining water from the pages and spine with a gentle side-to-side motion. When done carefully, blotting can minimize fading and wrinkling.; , Carefully remove debris left behind from the water. This could be soggy leaves from a puddle or a candy wrapper from a water ring. Whatever the case may be, remove debris to avoid further damaging the paper you are drying.To remove debris from a damp book, remove it with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. To remove debris from a waterlogged book, gather a large tub of clean, fresh water, and gently dip the book into the water, removing it slowly. This will pull the debris free without risking damage to the already-wet pages.  Blot each page gently, using a clean white cloth, or a white paper towel. Moving the cloth side-to-side can tear wet pages. Blot each page gently and carefully before moving on to the next.If the pages are only slightly damp, you can place the rag between each page. If the pages are entirely waterlogged, however, blot any pages stuck together as a single page.  For a paperback cover, blotting is safest, as you still run the risk of ripping the paper. A hardback book may be wiped down, though the movement still needs to be light and gentle. Because the covers are more durable and hardier than the individual pages of the book, they do not need to be tended to as quickly.  Do not neglect the cover. Once you’ve finished drying, make sure you dry the covers thoroughly, as leaving water on the cover could damage the book’s binding and encourage mold growth.	Shake any excess water from the book. Remove dirt or debris. Gently apply pressure using a clean, white towel. Wipe down and blot the front and back cover.
Set up wicks inside clean teacups by placing the wick in between two wooden skewer sticks and taping the ends.   Place sticks with wick over the top of the cup so that the wick is standing in the middle of the cup.      ; , Place wax flakes in your double boiler or pan and turn heat on stove to medium.  Stir flakes frequently so flakes dissolve evenly. Flakes should appear opaque as they melt.       Add one or two drops of food coloring (or until desired color is achieved).  Using oven mitts to protect your hands, pour wax into waiting teacups. Pour slowly as you don’t want to disturb the position of the wick.  The wax should appear cloudy and smooth to the touch and it is ready.   Trim wick to size using sharp scissors.	Prepare cup(s). Melt wax. Pour melted wax into teacups. Allow for ample dry time before using or giving as a gift.
Always have two to five monologues ready to perform. You never know when a call is going to come up, and it’s best to be prepared rather than cramming at the last minute.   Make sure that the monologues are distinct. If one is dramatic, the other should be comedic. Likewise, it’s good to have one modern work and one classic or Shakespearean monologue. You'll stand out more if you choose unique monologues. Look through books and films for monologues that will allow you to showcase your special talent; chances are, they won't be the same ones the casting director has seen a hundred times before.  You need them to get an agent, as well as to audition at open casting calls.   Work with a professional photographer who specializes in acting and performance headshots, and make sure that he or she will provide make-up and hair styling. Know your type. Roles are written for certain looks and types, and you should have photos that meet these casting criteria. If your look and acting-age is “high school cheerleader,” include that look in your photo package. Likewise, if you’d make a great vampire, suburban mom or mob-wife, have photos taken that capture that aspect of your look and acting-age. Get electronic copies of your headshots. Some agencies may ask you to email your resume and headshots. Make sure your printed headshots are the same size as your resume. If you plan on printing your resume on standard 8 1/2" x 11" paper, your headshot should be the same size. It looks more professional this way.  A demo reel is footage that showcases your acting work. Make sure your plays are filmed, and prearrange with directors to use the work in your reel. The site www.productionapprentice.com/tutorials/general/create-a-winning-demo-reel-that-people-will-actually-watch/ has great tips on how to cater your demo reel to each casting director.  It's important to get a franchised, licensed agent. Many people who are not agents will claim to be. Real agents are licensed by the state, and generally receive 10% of your earnings.   A great way to meet an agent is to attend a casting workshop. A casting workshop is an opportunity for actors to audition in front of a number of agents and casting directors. You do have to pay to participate, but it’s a fantastic way to get your name and face out there. Do an online search for casting workshops in your area. The Call Sheet, which can be accessed at www.backstage.com, has a list of reputable talent agents. The SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) website, www.sagaftra.org, also has lists of agents.    SAG-AFTRA is the screen actors’ labor union. SAG-AFTRA can get you higher paying (and higher profile gigs), provides health insurance and makes sure that your work is not misused. It also opens the door to more audition opportunities, as agents have access to union calls. Actors’ Equity is the stage actors’ union. Again, it provides health insurance, and ensures fair wages and decent working conditions for stage actors. Equity actors also get to participate in workshops and seminars, and again have access to a greater number of auditions.	Memorize several monologues. Get headshots. Get a demo reel. Find a talent agent. Get your SAG-AFTRA card, or your Actors Equity Card.
You might have noticed going over potholes and bumps isn't as smooth as it used to be in your ride, which is probably a sign that your shocks are worn out and need replaced. A good easy way to test your shocks and make sure they're worn out enough to be replaced is to push down hard on the trunk or the hood directly above the wheel well. Good shocks should bounce up once and settle relatively quickly. If the body bounces any more than that after pushing, it's time for a new set.   You also need to know if your vehicle uses stand-alone shocks that attach to the vehicle suspension or frame, or if it uses shock-absorber units which integrated into a suspension strut, such as the MacPherson or Chapman strut. Your car may even have a combination, using shocks in the front and struts in the back. Struts can be difficult to replace, so it's best to let a professional handle that job.; , If you're unsure what type of shock absorbers you need, speak to someone at your local auto parts store or an auto mechanic to be sure you buy the right shock absorbers or piston for your vehicle.  You can get identical replacements of the shocks you have in your car currently, but taking the time to change out your shocks is also a good opportunity to perform any upgrades, if you're interested. Performance shocks are appropriate for heavy-use daily drive vehicles, especially trucks.Coil shocks are manufactured with a coiled spring around the body of the shock, which supports the weight of the vehicle and controls the movement of the suspension. These are adjustable, which means you can alter the height of your truck for optimum performance.  Twin-tube shocks have a set of tubes, one inner and one out, that house the piston, along with a layer of shock fluid and air, which can have a tendency to create a foamy, frothy mixture that can affect performance, though some modern variations feature a nitrogen mixture that addresses the issue. These are common on off-road vehicles.  Monotube shocks feature a tube and two pistons, which work essentially like the twin-tube shocks work, with one piston separating the layer of nitrogen from the air. It runs cool and is a popular performance choice for trucks.  Reservoir shocks are filled with fluid, and either pressurized air or nitrogen. As the shock absorbs bounce, the fluid contacts the gas, causing resistance and dampening the spring action.  Park your car on a level surface and loosen the lug nuts on both sides of the front or back end. Secure your vehicle with ramps and/or jack stands. Check your owner's manual for the correct jack positioning. When you've got the car up, remove the wheels and locate the shocks.   Shocks will be affixed with a vertical bolt that has to be extracted from within the engine bay or the trunk, or may be positioned at the top by a horizontal bolt that has to be unfastened and knocked out of position.  The most difficult part of the job is removing the old shocks, which can have a tendency to be really gunky with both age and road-grit, making the bushings and bolts somewhat difficult to remove. Check out the mountings to see if they're loose enough to get off, or if you're likely to crack the rubber around the bushing. It's ok if you do, since you're changing out the shock anyway, but it's usually easier to spray some WD-40 or PB Blaster in there and let it sit for a few minutes to try to loosen things up before you get to work.  Lots of cars have the top bolts under the fabric in the trunk of the car, which means you'll have to lift up the lining to get to the shock bolts and remove them with a ratchet and socket. As always, consult your shop manual for more specific guidelines regarding the location of the shock tower bolts. In general, though, they'll be in the trunk.   To unfasten the bolts, turn the socket and ratchet counterclockwise, greasing the bolts with penetrating fluid to eliminate any surface rust, if necessary.  Use a socket set or a nut splitter to disengage the nut that connecting the shock to the suspension, and remove it from the bolt. If there isn't enough room to operate the splitter, you can apply penetrating solvent.   Depending on the assembly, you may also need to disengage the knuckle at the top of brake assembly to get the the shock. Consult your owner's manual to find out for sure. Use the same process to remove the nut that is positioned at the top and keep the nuts separate so you will know which one goes where when it is time to install your new shocks., Wiggling the shock off the bolts can be surprisingly difficult, especially if the shocks are mounted on studs with a retaining bracket and everything's rusty. Wiggle it around a while and it should come off eventually.   One common frustration occurs when your piston rod keeps turning with you as you're trying to loosen the nut. You can use locking pliers on the end of the rod and keep it from turning with the pliers while loosening the nut with a wrench, but that can be just as frustrating. There's a hollow hex kit that fits over the rod and a tailored wrench made for the purpose, available at any auto parts store for about eleven bucks. If you need to bang on the bolt with a hammer or the end of your wrench to get it loose, that's ok, but make sure you put one the nuts back on to use as a hitting surface. Don't risk misaligning the bolt and messing up your ability to reinstall the shock properly. Let the metal cleaner do its work and take your time. It'll give.  You might need to use some pressure to constrict the shock as it falls into place, and you might need a help to help lift the suspension back up to reinstall the bolts in the correct positions. It can be kind of a balancing act, so it helps to have another set of hands. Screw on the nuts hand tight.  Reattach it and screw the bolts back on hand-tight. Replace the shock tower nuts you removed at the beginning of the process, probably in the trunk of the vehicle.  Before you go tightening everything back down, recheck the specifications for torque to be sure everything's secure.  Most of the shocks should wear out at the same time, so if you're going to do one, you're probably going to end up doing them all. Do in following the same steps and then put the wheels back on and tighten the lug nuts to finish the job.	Make sure you need new shocks. Purchase new shock absorbers. Consider upgrading your shocks. Jack your vehicle in an appropriate location. Check the shock mountings and spray them with metal cleaner. Remove bolts from the shock tower. Disconnect the shock from the suspension. Remove the shock absorber from the bottom and top bolts. Fit the new shock back onto the suspension control arm. If needed, you may once again affix the anti-roll bar if you removed it earlier. Check your torque specs in the service manual. Repeat the steps to replace the other 3 shock absorbers, if necessary.
Stick to the type of work that's their specialty.   Don't haggle over changes, give them a hard time or get too controlling. Part of supporting the arts is to encourage the artist to go on being an artist. You're not buying real arts in order to get the cheapest bargain or rip off the painter for a masterpiece by paying less than he did for the materials! If you do that, there's a good chance the artist will get disgusted, quit and do something else for a living, which reduces the appreciation of that masterpiece.	When buying art, choose an artist you enjoy (of any kind, performance or tangible) and then keep your description of your commission simple.
Keep alert and always report suspicious incidents to the authorities. If a student or co-worker talks about killing people or threatens to bring a knife or a gun to school, report this to a teacher or law enforcement. You may prevent a disaster by doing so. Many shooters often announce their plans ahead of schedule as a way of showing off; do not take their behavior lightly or as a joke and report it immediately. , Every school and office has some kind of lockdown procedure that stipulates how doors should be locked, where people should hide, and how the authorities should be called, so if you'd like to be prepared for a shooting, be familiar with your workplace's standard procedure when it comes to shootings. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to follow the protocol exactly in the event of a shooting, but knowing what it is can help you react in the most helpful way possible.  Though you should not bring a weapon to school or to the workplace just in case there is a shooting, if you'd really like to be prepared, you should take self-defense classes or other classes that teach you how to fight off an attacker in the event of an attack or shooting. Knowing a few fighting tricks can help you feel more confident if you have no choice but to attack a shooter.	Report any suspicious activity. Be aware of your school or workplace's lockdown procedure. Be prepared for a shooting.

Antique stores are an excellent place to find vintage silver coins. Ask your local shop owners if they collect or sell "junk silver," the antique term for old coins in good condition.If so, inspect their coin collection for silver half dollars. Thrift shops may also carry vintage coins, depending on their policies.  Ask friends who work in retail to put aside half dollars for you. You can come into their store and trade your paper money for their half dollars, which you can then inspect.  Search in your local classifieds for flea market listings. When you arrive, move from booth to booth and look for vendors selling coins. If you find a silver half dollar, ask your vendor questions about where they obtained it and whether they have a certificate of authenticity for the coin.If you want to get up early on the weekends, check garage and estate sales. Someone nearby may be selling their personal coin collections. Yard sales aren't a guaranteed place to find silver coins, but you never know.  Look for reputable coin dealers in your area and ask if they have silver half dollars for sale. Dealers often work with a variety of coins, and you're likely to find at least one who sells half dollars.  Find a dealer who is an Authorized Purchaser working with the U.S. Mint. This guarantees that your coin dealer is professional and safe. Most Authorized Purchasers have been in the business for over five years and have a strong client base. , Buy or build a metal detector and go searching in local areas. The best spots to look for coins are urban areas, like beaches, ski resorts, or campsites.Metal detecting will help you find a variety of old coins: you never know whether you'll get lucky and find a silver half dollar.  Heavily-trafficked areas are best for finding coins. While you can metal detect in the countryside or forests, you are unlikely to find what you're looking for. For older coins, visit old areas. A building constructed in the last ten years might not have older coins, but a building fifty or more years old might have vintage coins.	Check local stores. Visit flea markets. Purchase half dollars from coin dealers. Use a metal detector.
While this may sound difficult, you can save money if you can locate the leak for the plumber.   If you know you have a shut-off valve by the house, shut it off temporarily and check the meter by removing the lid and watching the dial on top of the meter. If you can't see the meter head, try digging around because they sometimes have dirt or grass covering the top of them. Once you locate it and the valve is turned off by the house, watch the meter to see if is turning. If it is still turning, then the leak is between the meter and the house. That is, unless you have a leaking valve, and this very common with these older bronze gate valves. Then, your leak may also be inside the house. At this point, walk the area between the meter and the shut-off valve. Look for signs of a leak such as: soft muddy areas, grass that is greener than the rest or growing much faster than other areas. If you see such an obvious sign, call the plumber or assess if you can make a repair yourself.  Try some other techniques to try to locate the problem.	If the toilets are fine, check the line running from the meter to the house. If you have the valve shut off at the house and the meter has stopped moving, then the leak is somewhere in the house.
It’s best if the whole family can be involved – mom, dad, sister, brother, even your dog. It’s the most fun if it’s in the evening because kids will think they are getting to “stay up late”. However, if you have young children or children with busy schedules, perhaps the movie shouldn’t run late into the night. Ending at 7:00 or as late as 8:30 is a good choice.; , It doesn’t matter whether it’s the media room or living room. It should be a comfortable space with room for everyone to sit – preferably on a couch together. You don’t have to buy a huge TV; just something bigger than an iPod screen will work.  Popcorn, by itself, is a light snack that everyone will enjoy. It’s good with M&Ms, but it’s up to you to decide what goes with it. You could even try cinnamon-sugar popcorn by first putting melted butter over the popcorn and then liberally sprinkling a container of cinnamon-sugar over it all. Eating snacks while watching a movie may be lazy, but it makes the evening 100% better. If the children are prone to fighting, you can give them individual bowls of popcorn. If kids are eating too fast, tell them there is plenty and that they need to slow down.  (See “Tips” for suggest movies.) Ask for movie suggestions. Make sure it is age-appropriate. Your teenager may suggest a movie you aren’t comfortable with your kids seeing. It is perfectly fine to deny your teen that choice in a nice way. You can suggest that she make a more family-friendly selection, indicating that she gets another shot at choosing. If your children don’t agree on a movie or can’t choose one, make a few family friendly suggestions, preferably rated G or even PG, depending on how old your children are and how well they could handle a slightly more mature movie. Family movie night, with children, should not go above PG. You don’t want your child to have nightmares! Try to encourage a movie that none of you have seen before, or you haven’t seen in a long time. Films rated PG however, might not be suitable for children below age 10, so its recommended to see a G rated film if you have children under 10.  This gives a sort of movie theatre illusion and makes the entire atmosphere much more fun. In addition, the TV screen is a lot brighter.  Laugh with your children during hilarious scenes, but try not to talk to anyone during the movie; it’s distracting.  Did they like it? Was it scary, sad, funny? Who was their favorite character? What was their favorite part? Children will enjoy talking about this and reviewing their favorite scenes – even reenacting them!  , You can simply talk about it or dig deeper into the subject – whatever you and your family is comfortable with.	Begin at a time that is good for everyone. Select the room you are going to watch the movie in. Make popcorn. Pick a movie. Turn the lights off, if no one will get scared and cry about it. Ask everyone to be quiet and tell them to enjoy the movie. At the end of the movie, ask your family what they thought about it. If there was a moral of the story (and there usually is), discuss it with your family. Bedtime is a great way to end a movie night!

For many pennies, one tablespoon (15 g) of salt in 1/2 cup (4 oz) of vinegar will get the job done. Stir the mixture to dissolve the salt.          If you don't have vinegar, use lemon or even orange juice. Copper oxide (the gunk on your pennies) dissolves in weak acid, and that's just what all three of these liquids are.; , Make sure they are not directly on top of each other.  If they're extra dirty or if you're cleaning a lot simultaneously, give them a few more minutes for good measure.          For those especially nasty pennies, scrub them with a scrubber or toothbrush after they've been resting in the solution for a bit.  Let them dry for around five minutes so they will no longer be wet. They will now sparkle.          If you don't wash them off, a blue-green sheen will develop on your pennies. That's what happens when the copper, oxygen, and chlorine (from the salt) combine (called malachite).	Put 1 tsp (5 g) of salt into 1/4 c (2 oz) of vinegar. Place your pennies in the vinegar or the lemon juice. Leave the pennies for around five minutes in the glass of vinegar or lemon juice. Take the pennies out, and wash them off.
Sitting in the chair cross-legged or on the edge will affect your horn angle.      ; , This is one of the most important parts of correct posture.   If you sit slouched, it will affect how much air support you blow into your horn.       If you lean into the back of the chair, more than likely, you are sitting slouched.  This is how your horn angle should be.   It should be between your kneecaps, if done properly.	Sit firmly in the chair, with feet flat on the ground. Keep your spine straight, preventing it from touching the back of the chair. Have the clarinet facing a forty-five degree angle.
Protect them not only from moisture, but light as well, which will cause the pages to fade.Use a box that is specially designed for comic books, since a wider box may allow room for your upright comics to fall over sideways. Select between “long” and “short” boxes.Even if you plan on expanding your collection in the future, buy a box that is appropriately sized for your current collection. Storing 100 comics in a “long” box that fits 300 will allow room for your upright comics to fall forward. With cardboard boxes, make sure that the cardboard is acid-free. For the most protection from outside elements, use plastic boxes.  Place each comic in the box vertically, as opposed to laying it flat on its back cover. Give yourself the ability to quickly search through titles without having to remove each and every comic first. Additionally, avoid the damage that may occur from stacking comics on top of each other.The combined weight of so many comics stacked on top of each other may press together the pages of those at the base, forming a seal, which will cause tears when you try to open them again. Additionally, if the edges of the comics themselves are not lined up exactly with each other, the weight of those on top may cause the corners or edges of those below to bend and crease.  Choose a storage space with consistent temperatures and humidity, since extreme changes in heat and moisture may hasten aging. Avoid placing them near sources of heat or cold, like radiators or a/c vents. Also avoid areas that are prone to leaks or flooding.To be extra cautious, shelve your boxes rather than set them directly on the floor, since moisture may still accumulate there, even without flooding.If you don't have adequate shelving, place your boxes on another raised surface, such as a pallet.Avoid stacking cardboard boxes if possible. If you must, keep your stacks to a maximum of five boxes each to prevent the ones on the bottom from being crushed under all that weight. Label each box according to your organizational method.Rotate the one at the bottom of the stack to the top periodically so no one box bears the brunt of all that weight over the long run. Ideal temperatures are between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 21 degrees Celsius). Humidity should ideally be around 35 percent, never more than 50 percent.	Store your comics in boxes. Stand them upright. Store your boxes safely.
Before you add your varnish, use paint to create an additional decorative design along the outside of your beads. For extra texture, use puff paint which dries in a bubble-like form above the surface of the bead.  To make your beads sparkly, use glitter glue or loose glitter over the surface of the paper. Add the glitter before your final coat of varnish to keep it from rubbing off as a result of wear and tear. Try adding several coats of glitter in different colors for a lovely rainbow effect.  Don't thread the beads on string; use string to create a decorative pattern along the outside of the paper. Cut a small piece of colored thread and use glue to wrap the exterior of the bead with the string. Use several pieces of string for added color and texture.  Use colored florists wire to thread the beads and create pretty spiral or geometric patterns around the outside. Run the wire through the middle of the bead, and then bend it to shape around the bead.  Use a translucent nail polish or watered down paint to coat your bead in an additional color. Adding the glaze will create a light, semi-opaque layer of color over the paper. You can also use watercolor paints for this.,	Add paint. Put on a little glitter. Wrap the beads up in string. Use a little wire. Give your beads a glaze. Finished.
You can stick to one kind or both, and it is a good idea to vary the colors if possible. For example, lentils come in a range of colors, including browns, blacks, yellows and oranges. Beans come in different shades and patterns too.   Keep the size differences in mind. Placing too large a bean or lentil next to a much smaller one may not be the look you're after in the mosaic design. Think about how you want the general design to be in terms of sizes before selecting the lentils and/or beans.; , It can be a canvas, a tile, a CD case or a wooden board. A canvas tends to look more professional for a wall hanging but it's really up to you and the end purpose to which you'll be putting the mosaic.  The design can be sourced from your imagination or from the internet (check art sites such as DeviantArt or Etsy and image sites such as Pinterest or Flickr for inspiration). Some design examples to help you include:   Abstract: Randomly placed lentils/beans, perhaps varying in colors and sizes. Abstract is likely to be the easiest choice for the beginner mosaic maker. A landscape: Use the colors and shapes of the lentils/beans to depict trees, flowers, fields, the sky, people and animals, etc. A portrait: Choose a famous person or a family member to replicate in a lentil/bean mosaic. A tracing: For example, trace around a hand, a foot or an object that you like the shape of. Make a rough draft of your drawing first so that you can have an idea of certain features, such as placement and defining of specific objects.  Transfer your final design onto the chosen canvas, outlining the areas clearly. Do not draw anything too small to add the lentils/beans to––keep the size of your mosaic objects in mind as you draw.  Follow the design and the color scheme you've chosen. Apply the liquid glue to a small area, then sprinkle the lentils/beans over the glue. After few seconds, press gently on the lentils to help them to adhere firmly to the canvas.  Continue working in sections, adding glue, then the mosaic items, until the drawing is filled.  In order for the mosaic to last a long time, spray varnish across it. This will also give it a glossy and firm look, which provides for a pleasant presentation.  Hang or display the mosaic for your family to see.	Select the lentils or dried beans you would like to form the mosaic. Decide on which surface you will present your mosaic. Decide which design will you will use for making the mosaic. Place the rough draft of your drawing beside where you're going to prepare the canvas for the mosaic. Apply the lentils/beans to the mosaic background. Repeat. Seal the design. Done.
It won't be a good day if you singe off your eyebrows and get third-degree burns on your hands, so turn off your car and let it cool down before you open up the hood and get to work. Let it sit for at least an hour before you start dissecting its parts.   It's not a dumb idea to protect yourself with goggles or gloves, either. If you don't want anything getting in your eyes or your hands getting covered in gunk, get out the protective gear. And, of course, a shirt you don't mind smudging with grease or oil.  The thermostat and radiator hose are linked to your car's cooling system; if you don't drain out the coolant, you're gonna get water everywhere when you start disassembling. Here's how:   Place a bucket (or some sort of container) underneath your radiator. You'll have somewhere between 4 to 8 cups of fluid pouring out, so don't skimp on the size of your container. At the bottom of the radiator, there should be a draining screw or cap (technically, it's a radiator drain cock). Twist this to the left, opening it up. Let all the water and coolant flow out. Keep the cap somewhere you won't lose it.  Every model of car is different. Some thermostats you could spot from a mile away, others will be an obstacle to even the most trained of eyes. If looking at your car's engine is like reading gibberish, find the radiator hose and follow it to the end -- that'll be where your thermostat is located.   The body of the thermostat is probably metal with a bit of gold in the center and possible a rubber ring around the edges. It resembles a top or dreidel in shape and size, or, a small plunger. If you're not quite sure what you're doing, consult your manual or look up the location online. It's better to know what you're looking for instead of poking around and possibly injuring yourself.  The hose is most likely clamped to the thermostat casing. Unscrew this and set it aside. Move onto the thermostat casing, exposing the thermostat itself. You will definitely need a screwdriver, and you may need pliers, for the record.   Most vehicles have a two-bolt or three-bolt system for the thermostat casing. If corrosion and gunk is building up prominently, clean up the area before you go about adding your new thermostat. A bit of water will probably come out with removal of the hose. This is normal.  Is it possible that your thermostat works, it's just stuck closed or a different part of your vehicle is starting to kick the bucket, affecting your thermostat's ability to make accurate readings? If so, it's very easy to test your thermostat. Here's how:   Get a pot of water boiling. Insert your thermostat. The thermostat should open at around 190 ºF (88 ºC). Since water boils at 212ºF (100ºC), this is more than enough. If the thermostat doesn't open in the water (and then close when it cools), you need a new one.  From here on out, it's mainly a matter of reassembly -- the easy stuff. Replace your thermostat just like it the old one was positioned. If applicable, replace the rubber ring, too, sealing the edges.   If the area is building up dirt and grime, wipe it down with some cleaner first. You want to maximize the life of your thermostat and not have to deal with this again anytime soon.  You remember what everything looked like, right? Here's a brief checklist:   Make sure the thermostat is snug and in place. Bolt down the thermostat casing over top of the thermostat. Finger start your bolt and then bust out your pliers or socket wrench and get to tightening. Be careful not to strip the bolts. Replace the radiator hose and clamp. The radiator should be snug on the outside of the thermostat casing and the clamp must be well-tightened.  If the coolant you just drained out was fairly new, just use the same stuff in the bucket and add it back in. If it was old, you may be better off throwing the contents of the bucket out and just using new coolant. Either way, replace the coolant and make sure the radiator drain cock is on tight.   Once replaced, check for leaks. Your car needs coolant to operate safely. If yours is leaking, you literally won't get very far.  You're done! Now all you have to do is keep an eye on your temperature gauge. If it's acting up, do a double check to make sure you secured everything appropriately. If so, you may need to consult a mechanic -- the problem probably lies elsewhere.	Make sure your car has cooled down. Drain the antifreeze out of your car. Locate your thermostat. Remove the radiator hose and take apart the thermostat casing. If desired, test your thermostat. Swap out your old thermostat for the new one. Reassemble the system. Replace the coolant and check for leaks. Get back on the roads.
Once you have found someone to assume the lease, you need to work with your leasing company to ensure everything is properly agreed and all the paperwork is complete. Each financial institution has its own procedure for lease assumption, but the procedure generally includes:   Submission of credit application by the new owner. When taking over a lease, a potential owner/lessee will have to fill out a credit application and be approved for the total amount remaining on the lease.Payoff or transfer of the current lease. Once the new owner/lessee is approved for purchase/lease of the vehicle, the lease or title will be transferred to him or her. Creation of new lease in new lessee name. When lease for the vehicle has been opened or transferred, the new lessee becomes responsible for the remaining payments on it. If you are operating through a lease trading company they will guide you through this process., The buyer will no doubt want to take a test drive in the car before completing the deal. They will also want to inspect the vehicle to verify that is in the condition you stated in the listing or advert.This is important for both buyer and seller, as you will both inspect the car together and agree on its condition. Having a clear and recorded understanding will avoid potential disputes down the line.   The seller should always accompany the buyer on the test drive. Be sure you are present for any independent inspections of the vehicle. It can be helpful to take photographs to ensure that you have proof of any minor blemishes or damage., When turning over a vehicle to a new owner, you will want to be sure to remove all personal items. That means taking out your iPod, gloves, charger cord, and any other items of personal property out of the vehicle. After this, be sure you clean the interior of the vehicle. Wipe down the dash, doors, and steering wheel, and clean the inside and outside of all the windows. Take the vehicle through the car wash or wash it yourself. Be sure to put a nice wax on it when you are through.  Depending on the arrangement you have reached, you will pass the car on to the leasing company, lease trading company, or directly to the person taking over the lease. Follow the instructions you have been given by your lease company to turn the vehicle over. Most companies will pick up the vehicle and handle turning it over to the buyer.   If you are in possession of the title to the vehicle, you will need to sign it over to the new owner or your financial institution. Check with the lease company for instructions on whom to sign over title to. Contact your state's Motor Vehicle Department to transfer ownership. This will eliminate the possibility that you might be held liable for any damages after the transfer. Once the paper work is all complete, and you have handed over the keys, the process is complete.	Contact your lease company. Take the buyer for a test drive. Prepare the vehicle for its new owner. Turn over the vehicle.
A petrol-driven generator with a rated power of about 3500W will serve for lighting, TV, fans and a fridge or freezer. The rated power is usually written on the body of the generator and it is that power the generator can deliver continuously for an average of 12 hours on a single tank of fuel.; , A typical microwave, for instance, uses 1500 watts, while a whole circuit of lights with CFC bulbs may only require 150 watts. Refrigerators use about 1200 - 1500 watts, but have a starting capacitor which increases the wattage momentarily when the compressor starts. Televisions use less the 1000 watts, depending on the type and size, a small room fan may use about 500 watts, and so on.  There are several different wiring systems that can be used to connect a generator to a home. The main two are discussed here. Contact your local Department of Labor and Industries, Planning Department, or Power Company to find out what is legal in your area. Do not consult the internet to find out which system is legal in your area. There are many people that are unqualified to offer advice doing just that, and the law can vary significantly between countries, states, and even cities.   Consider an interlock kit. These are fairly simple to install yourself and they are the cheapest option. However, they are illegal in many areas and can be very unsafe. They must be installed absolutely correctly. Safe installation also requires that you have several extra spaces in your existing breaker box or that you install a new one, which must be done professionally. It is also a strict requirement that you get a kit that is approved for your specific breaker box (should be made by the same company). Consider a manual transfer switch. This is a slightly more expensive piece of equipment which will require a professional install. However, it is the only guaranteed legal option and it is accordingly the safest. This will help keep you from accidentally electrocuting someone else or even yourself.  This hookup will go on the outside of your house and will have a recessed male connector (prongs that stick out, rather than holes you plug in to). It will connect to whichever panel system you installed inside your house. The installation should be performed by a professional, both to keep you safe and to make sure your system remains up to code. If you do not have this done by a professional, your insurance may be unable to cover your home, the city you live in could enforce a heavy fine, and you are very likely to hurt either yourself or someone else (in a hospital-if-you're-lucky kind of way).  You will find a lot of advice and instructions offered on the internet that are unsafe and put you at risk for injury, electrocution, or serious house fire. Be sure to always check with your city specialists before doing anything that will put you or your family at risk. Some common Do Nots include:   Do not connect your generator directly to your breaker box without an approved transfer switch. Do not connect your generator to a washing machine or dryer outlet.  This is especially important if you do not have experience with electrical work. You want to be sure that your family stays safe and, in the event of a fire, that your insurance company cannot dispute your claim because of "faulty wiring".	Determine the essential appliances in the home you cannot do without. List the appliances and electrical devices you plan to use, then look at their wattage or power requirement. Choose a wiring system. Install an inlet box hook up. Keep your family safe!, Get your setup inspected.
You will use some air for priming and testing your sprayer, so let it build up pressure while you get your paint ready. The compressor should have a regulator to allow you to set the pressure for the sprayer correctly; otherwise, fluctuations will occur as the pressure rises and falls while you are spraying.  The exact amount will vary depending on your sprayer, so look at the manual (or the equipment itself) for details.  Make sure it is tight; you may want to wrap the threads with Teflon tape to insure an airtight seal. This does not apply if your sprayer and hose are equipped with quick connect couplings.  (This is the reservoir attached to the bottom of your spray gun.) Use just enough to submerge the siphon tube in it.  This is usually the lower of two screws above the handle (pistol grip) of the sprayer.  Aim the nozzle into a waste bucket and squeeze the trigger. It usually takes a few seconds for the sprayer system to prime with liquid, so at first, only air will come out of the nozzle. After a moment, you should get a flow of paint thinner. If no thinner comes out of the nozzle, you may have to disassemble the sprayer to check for stoppages or loose seals in the siphon tube assembly.  A funnel helps, here, so you can return it to the original container. Mineral spirits and turpentine (two common thinners) are flammable solvents, and should only be stored in their original containers.	Turn on the air compressor. Adjust the regulator on the compressor to between 12 and 25 PSI (pounds per square inch). Attach the air hose coupling to the sprayer. Pour a small amount of paint thinner into the paint cup. Open the metering valve slightly. Prime the sprayer. Empty the spray cup of any remaining thinner.
Whether you’ve experienced nightmares that have been waking you up at night or overall insomnia, a disrupted sleeping pattern can signal stress and a feeling of anxiety. Monitor your sleep in the last six weeks. Have you noticed a difference? Do you sleep significantly less?   Use sleeping pills with caution. Their usefulness is debated and there are accidental deaths linked to them. Never use them without talking to your doctor. There are several reasons for which you might not sleep. Make sure your mattress is good and your bedroom dark. You should also talk about your sleeping problems with your doctor. You might be suffering from a condition such as sleep apnea.; , You don’t deal with stress as well as you used to and you feel more fragile. Each deadline is a source of major anxiety and you don’t know how to cope anymore. If you notice a negative evolution in your stress tolerance, it's probably time to act.   A lower tolerance to stress than usual is usually a sign of exhaustion or burnout.Don’t feel guilty and don’t lose faith in your ability to work if you’re more stressed than usual. We all have ups and downs. If you work in an abusive environment where the boss is using stress as a tool to increase productivity, a day off will not help. You should talk to your trade-union or HR and see if the law is on your side.  Those who know you the best, your family and friends, will probably notice if you're in desperate need for a break. Talk with them about your stress and ask them for their opinion. If you have a strong relationship, they will give you the best advice.Remember that communication is fundamental in a relationship. If you have been fighting with your partner recently, explain that you feel pressurised at work and are struggling. Let your partner express his/her feelings too. It’s important to realise that a stressed person is difficult to live with., A day off is ideal to relax but not enough when you have a serious physical or mental condition. You should talk to a doctor or a specialist if you suspect a depression or any other health issue.   Identify the signs. If you feel sad and down for weeks or months, you might be depressed. Depression is a real illness and has nothing to do with being weak.If you notice any unusual symptom, such as a rapid loss of weight, go immediately to your doctor.  Plan your mental health day during a slow time at work. Make sure your day off doesn’t bring stress on others. Check the calendar and your schedule to ensure your day off works for everyone.   Pick a Friday or a Monday if you don’t work during the week-end. Three days without working can do miracles.  Instead of saying that you are stressed, just tell your boss that you have a few important personal appointments or matters to address and would like the day off from work.   Be calm and confident in your approach and reassure him/her that you will have your work covered and/or deadlines met in time. Don’t pretend to be sick. If your boss doesn’t believe you, you might be in trouble. Don’t tell co-workers or clients that you need a mental health day. Some people are unfortunately intolerant toward health issues. Find a co-worker to back you up if there is an emergency at work and you’re needed. Consult with human resources to figure out how to categorize your day off. In some cases, the company may have actual mental health days built into your benefits - another reason why you should not feel guilty.  You might want to make the day off about you and only you. It shouldn’t be about fetching the little one at school or buying nappies. Discuss the planning in advance and make sure that everybody will respect your peace and quiet.   Offer to do more for the household before or after your day off to compensate. The key is respect and understanding. Tell your family not to call you on your mental health day, except in case of emergency. If you want, it’s also perfectly fine to spend your day with your family. It’s all about what you want!  , You want to make sure that your day off work is as relaxing as possible. A bit of preparation will help considerably. Make sure that you have all you need in advance. You don’t want to get stuck in a line at the supermarket’s cashier on your day off.   Make a list the day before and go buy what you need. Buy the essential, such as food and drinks, but don’t forget things that might make you happy. Make a schedule of your day and fit in priority what you would really want to do.  It’s better not to have any work at hand for your day off. Leave everything at your office place. Turn off your phone and avoid your emails.Make a resolution that you will not work and truly commit to taking your mental health care day seriously.   If you want to keep your phone turned on, make sure to turn off the emails to avoid any temptation.  If you've been exhausted or not sleeping, your day off should be spent in bed, resting your body and brain. You don’t need to sleep the whole time if you don’t want to, but you should definitely allow yourself to rest a few more hours than usual.Don’t forget to disconnect the alarm. Once you're awake, take a long and warm bath to relax your muscles. If doing chores and housework will make you feel a little saner on your day off, go for it. A mental health day doesn’t mean that you have to just sit around relaxing. In some cases, restoring order to your surroundings will bring you to a place of peace.  You’ve been working so much that you have eaten your sandwiches in front of your computer for the last four months. It’s time to go to a restaurant and enjoy a lazy lunch with a friend.   Go for a healthy meal and don't eat too much if you don't want to feel sleepy during the whole afternoon., Office work is stressful for the body and the spirit.There are several activities which will allow your muscles to stretch and your mind to relax. Here are a few suggestions:   There’s nothing like sport to make you spend some energy and stretch in a fun way. Try to pick a sport you like and avoid injuries! Go for a massage to feel truly relaxed and pampered. Aromatherapy is a good alternative. It is relatively cheap and can make you feel very good.  If work has taken you away from the ones you love, spend the day making time to be with those important folks. For example if you’ve been working endless hours, seven days a week and haven’t had a chance to spend time with your daughter, plan an entire day around what she wants to do.   You can also combine a few nice activities at the same time. Why not having a go at a good restaurant with your friends before heading for a massage with your family?  , If you're a workaholic, you will probably feel uncomfortable or guilty during your day off. Brush this feeling aside. Everybody deserves a day off once in a while and should be allowed to relax.   Remember that you need to care for yourself in order to continue being a productive worker and present parent/ family member. Things at the office will not fall apart if you're gone for one day. Getting a break can help you refuel and regain creativity to approach new problems.	Think about your sleeping pattern. Reflect on your stress tolerance. Discuss with your family and friends. Check that you're not suffering from a serious condition. Identify the right day. Plan with your boss and colleagues. Ask your family for peace. Determine what you will do in advance. Create a good resting environment. Catch up on sleep. Go for a nice meal. Relax your body. Reconnect with friends and family. Avoid any guilt.
Though popular music can sometimes seem cookie-cutter (especially lyrically) in fact, there is no single "right" way to write song lyrics. Great song lyrics have been penned from an incredibly wide variety of personal viewpoints that run the entire gamut of human experience. Some songs are cheerful, others are furious. Some songs are laid-back and relaxed, others are tense and paranoid. Some carry great personal significance for the writer, while others are about nothing at all. However, nearly all great songs convey some sort of emotion. For starters, when you write songs, try to express the way you feel when you think about certain topics, events, or people that are important to you. Your lyrics don't necessarily have to mention these things directly, though they certainly can.   Let's examine the opening lines of two songs - first, Elliott Smith's "Between the Bars" and, second, Kendrick Lamar's "Swimming Pools (Drank)". Both songs are about alcohol addiction. However, notice that they take two different approaches to the same topic, Smith opting for an indirect, referential approach and Lamar for a more direct one. Both successfully paint powerful emotional pictures.   Between the Bars: Drink up, baby, stay up all night/With the things you could do, you won't but you might/The potential you'll be that you'll never see/The promises you'll only make   Swimming Pools (Drank): Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles/Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago/Some people like the way it feels/Some people wanna kill their sorrows/Some people wanna fit in with the popular/That was my problem     , So, you've been thinking about things that make you feel strong emotions and writing down your thoughts in the form of lyrics. You're already off to a great start. Next, you'll need to organize your lyrics into some sort of song structure - decide which words go in the verse, which in the chorus, which in the bridge, and so on. Many popular songs have lyrics that rhyme - if you want your lyrics to rhyme, you'll also need to decide on a rhyme scheme (the pattern by which your rhymes are arranged).  Once you've written your lyrics and organized them into a song, it's time to start thinking about how you'd like your song to sound. Again, there's no right way to write a song, but you may find it easiest to figure out your instrumental parts before tackling your vocal melody - this way, you'll be able to fit your vocals to a solid instrumental backing, rather than custom-composing instrumental parts to fit your vocal melody. Naturally, try to compose instrumental accompaniments that compliment the emotions conveyed by your lyrics.   Songs' instrumental parts range in volume and intensity - some are overpowering "walls of sound", while others are so sparse that they're barely audible by comparison. For example, compare My Bloody Valentine's "Only Shallow" to Nirvana's "Polly". These two alternative rock songs were released within just months of each other, but their instrumentation couldn't be more different. "Only Shallow" is a massive, swirling juggernaut of distortion, while "Polly" is a dark, hushed composition, featuring just an acoustic guitar, Kurt Cobain's voice, a short bass interlude, and a few drum hits.  In much of popular music, the singer's vocals are the central feature of each song, supported by the instrumental backing. Now that you have your song's lyrics and instrumental parts figured out, it's time to set your words to music. Give your lyrics a melody, or, perhaps more accurately, melodies - most songs have related, but distinct melodies for verses, choruses, etc. Though some musicians use the concept of discord (conflict between the notes or chords in a piece of music) to great effect, generally, you'll want your vocal melody to be in an appropriate key for the chords of your song.   It's certainly not impossible to become successful writing and selling a cappella songs (songs with only vocals and no instruments) or purely instrumental recordings. For instance, Shai's version of "If I Ever Fall in Love" is an a cappella song that spent time at #2 on the US charts. Similarly, the recent explosion in popularity of electronic dance music has made hits out of songs with few (if any) lyrics. However, the vast majority of popular music has both instrumentals and lyrics, so writing these types of songs may give you more mass appeal. Note that, if you're writing rap songs, you generally won't have to worry about vocal melodies, as "pure" rap vocals are delivered tonelessly. However, many hip-hop artists incorporate tonality into their songs in the form of sung refrains or half-sung, half-rapped verses. See Chance the Rapper's "Juice" for an example of this technique.  Many popular songs with uninspiring verses, tepid instrumentals, and laughable lyrics are saved by the power of a tremendous chorus (sometimes called the "hook"). Try to make the chorus of your song a particularly poignant, expressive, and concise set of lines. Generally, the chorus is the part of a song that people will remember the best, so make it emblematic of your song as a whole. Another way to tackle this is to think of your hook as your song's "thesis statement" - if you had to sum up the emotions behind your song in a few musical lines, how would you do so?  , Above all else, when writing a song, try to imbue your work with passion both musically and lyrically. Your songs should make you, as a performer, feel strong emotions - if you find yourself bored by your music, don't be afraid to start from scratch. Music is just as much a craft as it is an art - it's something to be honed and perfected with plenty of practice. The best way to motivate yourself to work at your songwriting craft, of course, is to be truly passionate about it.  Though some musicians (like, famously, The Beatles) have been able to transition away from live performance in favor of dedicating themselves entirely to studio work, very few, if any, have been able to become widely-known in the first place without ever performing live. To start building an audience and gaining recognition as a musician, it's important to put in work as a live act. To start, look for opportunities to perform in your local area. Bars, clubs, and cafes are the "classic" proving grounds for up-and-coming musicians, but they're far from the only places where you can perform. Any place or occasion where people gather can conceivably be an opportunity to perform. Weddings, birthday parties, farmer's markets, and even street corners can be places to build your audience and sell your music.   Don't be afraid to start small - all but the luckiest musicians paid their dues as local acts before making it big. One semi-recent example is Lady Gaga, who become a fixture of several NYC bars and nightclubs for several years in the mid-00's before getting her shot at the spotlight.  Nearly all serious musical acts should spend some time in the recording studio. Generally, in the studio, artists partner with a producer or engineer to create a finished product that's to their satisfaction. Recording your music gives you the opportunity to distribute it to your fans (in physical form as a CD or online as a file) in a polished, definitive form that's exactly how you want it. It also gives you the opportunity to give your music to the types of people who can help you make money from your music - namely, record companies and industry scouts. If you haven't recorded any music yet, you may want to record a demo as your first move. Demos are short (about 3-6 tracks) "mini-albums" that give you a chance to showcase your musical style - think of them as musical resumes for prospective employers.    Meticulously practice your songs before you step into the studio. Studio time can be quite expensive, so you'll want to be able to record each song in as few takes as possible. The costs associated with lengthy studio sessions can quickly add up, so try to get to the point where you can play all of your songs in your sleep before you attempt to record them. For the same reason as you'll want to have your songs down pat before you enter the studio, you'll also want to avoid excessive experimentation in the studio. For instance, don't let a producer convince you to waste time trying out countless effects pedals. The place for experimentation and improvisation is in the practice room.  Booking your own shows and studio time, negotiating your own contracts, and distributing your own music is time-intensive and requires a great deal of expertise. Because of this, many dedicated musicians decide to hire the services of a professional manager or booking agent to handle the business aspects of the music industry. Though this option may not be feasible with the average starving artist's budget, it can help a promising young artist maximize his or her potential and rise within the industry. Be sure that your manager is established and reputable - don't fall prey to scam artists.  When you've begun to gather a following and you've recorded a demo or two, you may want to try to sell yourself to record companies to win a recording contract. Though large, international record companies occasionally sign artists that are relatively unknown in terms of mainstream airplay (see: Epic Records signing experimental hip hop group Death Grips), obscure and up-and-coming artists may have more luck when courting smaller independent labels. Research labels that release the type of music you're interested in selling. Then, if they have a policy of accepting unsolicited submissions, feel free to send them demos, photos, interviews, reviews, biographies, and the like (if sent all together, these types of materials compose what is called a press pack, a standard method artists use to distribute their work and propagate their image).   Of course, perhaps the best way to get noticed by a record company is to generate attention for yourself through groundbreaking music innovation, noteworthy live performances, and/or a unique image. In other words, if you're able to generate fame (or notoriety) without a record label, record labels may come to you.  Performing your own songs in a live setting is important, but this is only one of the ways that musicians can gain professional clout. Musical artists can (and should) also try to find work as session musicians, soundtrack composers, and more - any opportunity to contribute music to another person's project or endeavor is chance to spread your name.   One oft-overlooked opportunity for artists to create original music for profit is in the world of jingle-writing. Advertising agencies regularly employ musicians to compose and perform songs for commercials. In fact, several music production houses (called "jingle houses") specialize in the process, using in-house musicians to create jingles for their clients.Especially when starting out, musicians may not have the luxury of being able to be picky with their employers. Don't worry too much about "selling out" - in some respects, it's part of the process of making your name as a musician. In fact, many now-famous performers with anti-authority bents originally took part in more "commercially friendly" music endeavors. Case in point: Tupac Shakur was originally a member of the light-hearted hip-hop group Digital Underground (of "Humpty Dance" fame).  Music is a more competitive field today than ever before. With the advent of online music retail sources, contemporary musicians don't just have to compete with each other, but also with the stars of ages past whose music is just as available to consumers as their own. To stand the best chance of being able to sell yourself as a musician, it's important to make sure that you stand out from the pack of modern artists. Don't make music or perform in ways that can cause you to be confused with another artist. Instead, break the mold and forge an artistic image that's uniquely yours.   This advice extends to your music itself as well as to the way you perform. Take pride in the flourishes and idiosyncrasies that are unique to your performance. Many successful musicians, like Prince, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, and countless others, had and/or have performance styles that are unforgettably indelible. The clothes you wear, the way you carry yourself onstage, and the way you play your songs all combine to create your image as a performer, so take time to develop these aspects of yourself as an artist.  Whether you're playing live shows or trying to move copies of your latest album, it's almost always in your best interest to reach out to as many people as possible. Advertise yourself as a musician using every method at your disposal - word of mouth (for instance, if you teach music part-time, try telling your students about an upcoming concert at the end of their lessons), self-advertising (flyers, etc.), and even cross-promotion with local radio stations are great ideas for promoting yourself. Also be sure to take advantage of your online visibility. Nowadays, a well-timed social media "push" can be a much more effective and efficient way to reach your fan base than conventional advertising.   The humble flyer is a well-worn method by which musicians self-promote. These can be easily massed-produced for relatively cheap with nothing more than a basic computer and a printer. Be sure your flyer includes any information your audience will need to attend your upcoming event - time, place, date, and admission price are essential. Also ensure your flyer is somewhere it will be noticed, such as a live music venue, bar, coffee shop, or college campus.  No matter how good they are, your songs won't ever sell themselves. Use every performance as an opportunity to sell songs - either by reminding your audience that you have physical CDs for sale or by directing them to a personal webpage, etc. Don't shrink from selling your music. If you put on a good show, you deserve whatever money you make from selling your music - you're not selling out by giving your audience the chance to support you.   The internet offers plenty of exciting opportunities for musicians to share and sell their music. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter let musicians keep in touch with their fans and notify them of new songs and live performances. Also, sites such as GarageBand and Soundcloud offer the opportunity for artists to host and even sell their actual music online.  Some recent artists have actually managed to become breakout successes primarily through the internet. For instance, Justin Bieber's path to stardom began when a record industry executive accidentally clicked one of Bieber's online videos by accident.  You have probably noticed that, today, most of the songs on the radio sound somewhat alike in terms of their sleek, flawless production style. This is a deliberate choice on the part of the songs' creators. A song's production values are a serious factor to consider before releasing it to the public - minor flaws like missed notes, background noise, and noticeable transitions between separate takes can become glaringly obvious with repeated listens. Though there's certainly a market for music with a lo-fi aesthetic, the market for sleek, polished recordings is undeniably bigger. So, at the very least, be sure to consider whether your music's production values suit your professional goals.   Some musicians have the experience and know-how to produce their own music - Kanye West and some of his peers in the world of hip-hop, for instance, produce many of their own songs. However, many musicians don't know how to "work the boards", so to speak. If you fall into this group, consider paying for studio time with a professional producer, who will be able to help you record and mix your music as professionally as possible.  Unfortunately, the music industry has a history of taking advantage of well-meaning musicians' kindness. Always be aware that unsavory tour managers, record labels, venue owners, concert promoters, and the like may be out to get you. Never let someone you don't know entangle you in a vague or poorly-defined agreement. Don't agree to work for free as a musician for the "possibility" of pay at a later date. Don't exchange your self-agency for the promise of fame. Don't let any managers or staff you employ make decisions for you without your consent. As a general rule, try to remain guarded as you navigate the music industry. Though many of the people in the industry are completely honest and ethical, all it takes is one legally-binding agreement with a bad apple to completely sideline your music career.   Contracts are a must. Oral agreements, even with people you're close with, aren't easily enforced. Always get any agreement you make in writing. If you're being asked to sign a significant binding agreement (like, for instance, a record deal), get the counsel of an experienced lawyer before signing.	Write lyrics with emotional meaning. Give your song a sense of structure. Compose instrumental backing music for your song. Set your lyrics to a melody. Pay special attention to your song's chorus or hook. Be passionate. Play live gigs. Record your music. Consider enlisting the help of a manager. Reach out to record companies. Look for unconventional opportunities to sell yourself as a musician. Build a distinct image. Promote yourself. Market your songs in-person and online. Pay attention to the production values of your music. Never let the industry take advantage of you.
The ideal temperature for older books is below tween 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 22 degrees Celsius).The ideal humidity level is around 35%.Conditions that are too dry can cause your old, rare books to become brittle, but excessive moisture could lead to mold or foxing (the specks, splotches, and other forms of discoloration that often afflict old books).  Ultraviolet light fades the inks and dyes used in many books, especially in older works. Exposing a rare antique book to constant sunlight will cause considerable discoloration within a few short days., Place your old, rare books in unsealed acid-free polyethylene bags.Invest in a bookshelf with a glass door to further protect them from dust., Remove a fragile book from the bookshelf by tilting it backwards and easing it out of place from the front or top sides of the book. Do not remove the book from the top of its spine, since this is the most fragile part of any book. Ease the book open rather than forcing it, since force will likely cause stiff pages to come unbound., Even old, rare books can be stored on bookshelves and actually do well when stored this way as long as the humidity, temperature, and light conditions of the room are managed well. Keeping the books in a vertical position not only saves space but ensures that each book does not have to support the weight of any other book., The weight of large, heavy books put pressure on the spine, causing pages to slowly pull away. Avoid stacking too many of these larger, heavy books on top of one another, though, since stacking more than two or three such books puts too much pressure on the bottom book., The books should be packed securely enough to prevent them from tumbling over, but not so tightly that they are difficult to remove. Leaving a small gap between books both allows you to remove them with ease when you wish to and allows for greater air circulation between the books. This will prevent unnecessary friction or stress caused by squeezing one book against another.	Monitor the temperature and humidity of your storage location. Keep the books away from strong light. Protect your books from dust. Handle the books with care. Store most books on shelves. Store heavy books on their sides. Shelve your books securely, but leave a little wiggle room.
The drop, cover, and hold on technique is the cousin of the famous "stop, drop and roll" for fires. While it's not the only method of protecting yourself indoors during an earthquake, it is the preferred method of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross.Big earthquakes occur without much, if any, warning, so it's recommended that you drop to the floor as soon as it hits. A small earthquake could turn into a big earthquake in a split-second; it's better to be safe than sorry.; , Get under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture. If possible, stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.    Do not: Run outside. You're more likely to get injured trying to get out of the building than staying put.Head for a doorway. Hiding under a doorway is a myth.You're safer under a table than you are under a doorway, especially in modern houses. Run to another room to get under a table or other piece of furniture.  Researchers have shown that most injuries happen when people try to change the place of hiding or when the place is crowded and everyone has a goal to get outside safe., The ground may be shaking and debris could be falling. Hold on to whatever surface or platform you've gotten under and wait for the shaking to subside. If you were unable to find a surface to hide under, continue to keep your head shielded by your arms and tucked down low.  Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.   Many injuries are caused when people leave their bed and walk across broken glass with their bare feet., Research suggests that many injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.   Be careful when you do go outside. Walk, do not run, in case of violent aftershocks. Collect yourself in an area without wires, buildings, or crevasses in the earth. Do not use elevators for egress. The power can go out, causing you to be trapped. Your best bet is to use the stairwell if it's free.	Drop to the ground. Take cover. Stay inside until it's safe to get out. Hold on. If you find yourself in bed while an earthquake strikes, stay there. Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside.
There are 2 common types suitable for home use: hinge-mounted and fixed post (also known as wall mounted). Hinge-mounted doorstops remain out of the way and don't require drilling any holes into your wall. Fixed post doorstops require you to drill into your wall to mount them, and are best suited for heavy doors.  Hinge-mounted doorstops consist of a small metal body, 2 rubber pads (1 of which is adjustable), and a metal ring. They are readily available at hardware stores and will fit nearly any door.  Close the door on which you are installing the stop, and use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the hinge pin out of the top hinge. Place the tip of the screwdriver underneath the flared top of the hinge pin, and use the screwdriver as a lever to force it out.  Align the doorstop so that the adjustable rubber pad faces the wall, and the fixed pad sits flush against the door. Hammer the hinge pin back into place.  Twist the threaded rod attached to the adjustable pad to determine how far the door can be opened. This may require a flat-head screwdriver, or you may be able to grab the pad in your fingers and twist it.  Fixed post doorstops consist of a short, rigid post with a rubber pad on 1 end. The other end is affixed to your wall or baseboard, usually by drilling a hole and threading the stop into the hole.; , Using a pencil, mark the point on the baseboard that lines up with the edge of the door. Now mark a second point that is 1.5 inches (38 mm) from this point, towards the door's hinges. Be careful not to mark the point further away from the edge of the door than this, because if the doorstop is installed there it could punch a hole through a hollow-core door.  Using a drill with a 1/8 inch (3 mm) bit, drill a hole into your baseboard where you drew the second pencil mark.  The doorstop will have 1 side with a threaded screw protruding from it; screw this end into the hole you drilled by rotating it clockwise until it is flush with the wall.	Decide what type of doorstop you want to install. Buy the doorstop(s). Pry the top hinge pin out. Fit the hinge pin through the ring on the doorstop. Adjust the doorstop to allow the desired opening distance. Buy the doorstop(s). Open your door until it is parallel with the wall. Drill a hole into the baseboard to mount the doorstop. Screw the doorstop into the hole.
The string should be the length that you want the radius of the alpine wheel to be, from its center to one edge. This forms a simple compass, where one stick stays in the center while you pull out the other stick to make the string taut and walk around marking a circle, keeping the string taut at all times. Drop marker rocks or similar to define the circle as you go, or simply draw the circle in the dirt with a stick if the soil allows for this.; ,, Add compost, fertilizer, etc., to improve the soil as you'd do normally. Depending on the plants you're adding, adjust the soil improvers as required. , Divide the circle into 8 even divisions. Using the bricks, place them in lines from the center to the circle's edge. Push the bricks down about halfway into the soil, leaving a tiny edge to form a mini wall alongside each division.  Place a ring of bricks around the outer edge of the circle to define its end. Again, only push about halfway down, leaving the rest sitting up above the soil.  Or, if you're adding herbs, plant as many as will be suitable for the amount of herbs you have. Go for variety, planting a different kind of plant in each division; it will look more interesting when it has grown.  Pat down gently. Water as needed.  Take care not to tip gravel onto the actual plants. If wished, you can skip this step if you don't think it'll help the plants.  Place interesting pebbles or rocks in and around the plants to add a final touch of interest to the alpine wheel. Don't overdo this; less is usually best.  Tend to it regularly to prevent weeds from taking over. Keep adequately watered.	Tie the two ends of string to the pieces of wood. Use the string compass to map out a circle for the alpine wheel.  , Dig over the alpine wheel area. Place the circular object of choice at the center of the wheel.  , Make the spokes. Complete the circle's edge. Plant about three alpine plants per division, spaced evenly apart. Fill the dirt in neatly around the newly planted plants. Place gravel on each division. Add pebble or rock features. Admire the finished alpine wheel.

You'll need to loosen the string that you want to set to relieve tension on the string as you work on other steps. You don't have to remove the strings completely but loosen them enough so that you have room to work under them on the neck., The guitar nut is on the top of your neck, near the headboard. It's what the strings are pulled over before they are wrapped around the tuning pegs. Find a screw that's about the same height as the guitar nut and one that can fit snugly under the strings of your guitar. You may have to search around at a hardware store until you find the right sized screw., Cut off a piece of the screw by bending it back and forth with needle nose pliers. You need the piece of the screw to be small enough so that it can fit under a particular string but not affect the rest of the strings on your neck., This piece of metal will affect the strings intonation. The higher that you slide the screw towards the nut the higher your pitch will be. The closer that you slide the screw to the fret, towards the bridge, the lower or flatter the note will be. Continue to adjust the metal until your note is in tune.	Loosen the string that you need to adjust. Find a screw that's the same height as the guitar nut. Break the screw into a quarter inch (0.63 cm) piece. Slide the screw under the string between the first fret and the nut.

With a simple Internet search for “car clubs,” you will be able to find listings of clubs dedicated to car enthusiasts., If you have this additional information, you will have a better chance of finding the particular car and owner you are looking for., Some car club sites will list owners by name and include contact information.With a little luck, you’ll find the person you want.	Identify the type of car. Look up car clubs online. Narrow your search by the style or year of the car. Look for owners in your area.
Dwarf ornamental peppers work best for indoor growing, since many of the large varieties may not have adequate room for their roots to develop in indoor containers.; , Clays like terra cotta can actually draw moisture out of the soil, especially in the warm, bright conditions required for growing chili peppers. These peppers need a lot of moisture to grow and may dehydrate in a clay pot.  While chili peppers thrive on vast amounts of water, a drainage hole prevents too much excess water from gathering and drowning or rotting the roots.  Many containers, especially if previously used, contain hidden bacteria and insect eggs that can sabotage new plant life. Wash your container out with hot water and soap to eliminate most threats.  Garden soil often contains bacteria that can damage your pepper seeds, preventing germination or hindering growth. A multi-purpose compost mix purchased from a local gardening store should do the trick, but the higher quality soil you use, the better your odds are of successfully growing your plants.   Improve the quality of your soil further by mixing in some vermiculite.	Select your chili pepper variety. Opt for a plastic pot over a clay container. Choose a pot with a drainage hole. Sterilize the pot before use. Purchase potting mix.
This technique is great for mermaid parties and easy to make. All you need is beach towels, ribbons, and rubber bands.   Thicker rubber bands will work better for this design. The ribbon needs to be long enough to fit around your future mermaid’s waist., Place the towel, preferably a beach towel, around the mermaid’s waist. The towel should droop down like a long dress. , Tie a ribbon around the mermaid’s waist. Use the same knot you’d use to tie a shoe. You don’t want to suffocate the mermaid, but make sure it doesn’t slip off., Wrap a rubber band around the last foot of the towel. Leave the rubber band in the center of the towel on your last wrap around. This will produce fins out of the last foot of the towel.	Gather your materials. Position the towel. Secure the towel. Create the tail.
There's no surefire way to start writing a song, but most people start with either a guitar riff or a vocal melody. Starting with a melody usually involves playing around with some chords on the guitar and singing over it until you find a melody you like. This can be the start of either the verse or the chorus of your song. Starting with a riff usually involves working on the guitar until you come up with a good metal riff, something that's both catchy and driving.; , A metal song, like rock and pop, is usually made up of a combination of verse, chorus, and bridge, with an optional intro and outro. You'll need to work with your rhythm guitarist to create a structure based around the original riff or melody you came up with. Create a chord progression for your verse and chorus, and decide if the song needs a bridge.The basic song structure of rock and metal songs goes: intro, verse, chorus, verse, solo, chorus, chorus, outro.  After your song has a basic structure, it's time to add drums and bass. There isn't really any trick to this, other than jamming through the song with your drummer, rhythm guitarist, and bassist until your drummer and bassist have a sense of the song and what kind of beats and bass lines will work in each part.Metal bass tends to follow the chord structure closely, valuing rhythm over melody. But you aren't limited to that. Experiment with bass lines that follow the vocals, follow the lead, or do something completely different, but complementary.  If you've got a lead guitarists, now is the time to add some lead guitar melodies to your song. It's best to try to find guitar melodies that compliment the vocal melody, and don't get in the way of it.  Metal music deals with a wide variety of topics when it comes to lyrics. You can write about just about any subject. A good general rule of thumb for writing metal lyrics is to keep the themes simple, and the imagery and metaphors interesting.Consider, for example, this verse by Vastum, “Our depths of joy in this saturation / In our polymorphously perverse constitution / The dissolution of our grief comes in libidinal death and the grace of mourning”. It deals with simple themes of sexuality, but uses verbose and unusual language. Consider the interesting use of extended metaphor in the song Anomalistic Offerings by Suffocation, "The pain is unbearable, but you continue making the incision / With drill in hand, you find the seed of the demon inside / Blood spews over the walls as you drill deeper," in which cranial surgery is a metaphor for battling inner demons.  Once you've got all the parts of your song in place, the structure, the melodies, the riffs, the drums, and bass, it's time to start practicing. Work on the song until the band is tight together. As you play the song, listen for places you can make improvements. Talk over your ideas about the song with the band and change it as you all see fit.   Record the band playing the song so you can listen to it more closely. That way you can spend time analyzing the individual aspects of the song on your own time.  You can write songs without a band, but it's harder, especially for metal. Metal has a lot going on in it instrumentally, so you'll likely find writing it on your own difficult. But you can at least start the song before forming the band. And if you're multi-instrumental, meaning you have some skill with all the instruments in a metal band, you can even write the whole thing yourself if you want to.   If you want to write the song by yourself before forming a band, you'll need access to drums, a guitar, a bass, and recording equipment, at least a microphone and a computer. Then you just follow the song composing steps one by one, recording each part before moving on to the next. If you want to start writing a song before forming a band, you can write just the rhythm guitar and vocal melody of the song. That will give the song a solid base that can be built upon once you've got some bandmates.  Before you form a band, you need to decide how many members you want, and what instruments everyone will play. Usually metal bands consist of a drummer, as bassist, a vocalist (who may also play guitar/bass) and two guitarists, one as rhythm and the other as lead. Most bands follow this type of line up but you don’t have to have this. You could have one guitarist or no bassist for example. It's up to you., There are a number of ways to find people to be in your band. The easiest and often most effective way is to join with people you're already friends with, who have musical skill and instruments.Another way to find band members is to place an ad on a site like craigslist. Make a posting explaining your mission to form a band, what kind of music you want to play, and what roles you're looking to fill.  There are certain characteristics you need to look for when recruiting and members. Your fellow members need to have similar tastes in music, not identical, but similar. You also need to find people who have similar levels of skill, otherwise you might have one member who holds back the rest. It's also important that everyone in the band gets along with each other. If there's some serious personality clashing in your band, it won't last very long.  There's a wide range of sub genres within the metal genre, so it's best to pin point your style before you start. You can choose anything from black metal to grind core. Make sure all of your band members agree on a style. Some popular metal sub-genres include:Death metal, which is characterized by down-tuned guitars playing fast, intricate rhythms along with growled vocals and dark subject matter. Power metal, which is characterized by fast tempos, melodic harmonies, and clean vocals. Black metal, which is characterized by cold atmospheres, satanic imagery, and raspy, harsh vocals.  It's going to be hard to write songs in a particular style without being very familiar with that style. It's likely you've already listened to plenty of music in the style you're interested in, but it will help greatly if you expand your knowledge and try to find more artists who play in that style. The more familiar you are with the conventions and particulars of a certain style, the easier it will be to start writing good metal songs.  While no formal music education is required to write a good metal song, knowledge of music theory can only help you. You can research online to find resources for learning about the basics of music theory.	Start with either a melody or a riff. Build the song's structure. Add drums and bass. Add lead guitar optionally. Write the lyrics. Practice the song and work out the details. Consider whether to make a band before or after you start writing. Decide on what instruments you want. Look for band members. Find people who have a similar vision. Pinpoint type of metal you want to play. Listen to a lot of your preferred genre. Study music theory.
Sometimes, while riding, the chain will slip off of its intended path, but not break. Because, in this case, the chain is still routed through both the front and rear derailleurs, no special maintenance is needed - all you'll usually need to do is slip the chain back onto its sprocket. When you experience a slippage, get off the bike and look for the slippage. Usually, the chain falls off of the front sprocket, but stays threaded through both derailleurs.   Look for places where the chain has become jammed against the frame - these jams must be addressed before the bike can be ridden again.; , Sometimes, in the event of a slippage, the chain gets jammed between the rear sprocket and the frame. In this case, it's a good idea to loosen the quick release on the rear wheel and undo the wheel nut to loosen the rear wheel from the chain. When you've loosened the rear wheel enough, simply pull the chain out.   Open the quick release by first pulling the small lever at the center of the rear wheel. Then, loosen the wheel nut on the other side to loosen the "hold" the rear wheel has on the frame. Once loosened, the chain should come out easily. Don't forget to re-tighten the quick release before riding away. You should be able to close it completely - it should be tight, but not too tight to push all the way down. If it feels too tight, loosen the wheel nut and try again. Likewise, if it's too loose, then tighten the wheel nut.  For bikes with rear derailleurs, simply slacken the chain and thread it around the front sprocket. On most bikes, the rear derailleur is spring loaded so that it keeps the chain tight while riding. Take advantage of this fact by pushing the arm of the rear derailleur forward to introduce slack in the chain. Then, use this slack to thread the other end of the chain around the smallest of the front sprockets. Release the arm of the rear derailleur and ensure the chain is tight.   From here, you can usually simply ride away! Your bike may shift somewhat erratically until the chain shifts into the gear it was in when the slippage occurred.  For bikes without a derailleur, catch the chain on the sprocket by pedaling. Many bikes (like "fixies") don't have derailleurs. The easiest way to repair a loose chain in this case is to hook the chain onto the rear sprocket, hook as much of the chain as you can on the bottom of the front sprocket, and carefully turn the pedal backwards. The chain should "catch" and begin to turn around the front sprocket. When the "caught" portion gets to the top of the front sprocket, the chain should begin running through the bike's gears as normal.   Turning the pedals is easier if you elevate the bike's rear wheel. To do so, you can put the bike on a stand or prop up the rear of the frame with any materials on hand. Alternatively, you may get a helper to hold the rear wheel off the ground as you put the chain back on or turn the entire bike upside down.  Get on your bike and pedal forward at a slow speed. If your bike has gears, your chain may "jump" back into the gear it was in when the slippage occurred. Otherwise, keep changing gear until the chain pedals smoothly.   Note - on fixed-gear bikes, chain slippage can be particularly dangerous and problematic and is often the symptom of a chain that's too loose. Consider adjusting the tension in your chain before riding again.  Before you resume normal riding, make sure you are in a comfortable gear. If your bike has them, change gears on both the rear and front derailleurs until your chain turns smoothly without producing any noise.	Find the slippage. Use the quick release if the chain is jammed. Loosen the chain if your bike has a rear derailleur. Turn the pedals on a bike without a derailleur. Pedal forward gently until the bike is in the right gear. Perform some final checks.
It can either be a classic kung fu fight like the Bruce Lee or Matrix movies or Krav Maga like Bourne Ultimatum or Boxing like Rocky.; , If you are shooting a kung fu fight, make sure the person can pull off high kicks and knows at least a couple of takedowns, etc. If he doesn't, get someone who has trained in the art to teach him  , Create pauses in the fight after every few seconds and register the fighters expressions by zooming into his face etc.Get your fighter to make funny wah wah or "hiyah" sounds . It adds to the feel of the fight.  Only boxing punches in a fight is really boring.Include the high kicks frequently,the takedown now and then.Do not just show one person getting beaten up.

The installation method has changed within the last few years. If you have older models, you will need to presoak your filter in for 15 minutes in a glass of water.   For all recently purchased filters, follow the remaining instructions.; , Wash your Brita pitcher with soap and water if you haven’t done so in the last few weeks.  Unwrap your Brita pitcher filter.  Let cold water run over your filter for 15 seconds.  Run water over the top of the carafe and filter. Repeat every 40 gallons (151.4 L) or two months.

If you pick the plant bare, it'll stay that way. Always choose certain stalks and leave others to produce more growth for the next harvest.; , Parsley doesn't like drying out, so the warmer the weather, the more attention you need to give it by watering sufficiently.  Lob off the beginning flower heads to prevent them from taking. Once they're growing, all the plant's energy is directed to the flowers and your culinary leaf stock will die back and stop being luscious.  Apply liquid manure or a suitable fertiliser to encourage more growth. Keep up regular applications.   Try sulphate of ammonia: 1 tablespoon to 5 liters (1.3 US gal) of water. Add to the soil (not the leaves) and water in well.	Harvest parsley generously but never completely. Keep watered during hot weather. Prevent the parsley from flowering. Give the plant a booster.
This bowl can be plastic, aluminum, or steel, but it should NOT be made of lead. Put this bowl on a sunny surface outside.  The cup or bowl should be shorter than the edges of the large bowl.  Fill the large bowl with water but do not go over the edge of the small bowel or cup.  Cover the bowl very tightly with plastic wrap. Use tape or rubber bands to ensure a tight seal.  This should be right over your cup or bowl and should angle the plastic down. Make sure the plastic does not touch the cup, though. A good weight to use would be a rock.  The sun will evaporate the water in the large bowl, causing the water vapor to rise and condense on the plastic. Since the plastic is weighted and angled, the condensation will roll down into your cup. Mmmm! Clean water!	Get a fairly deep, large bowl. Put a cup or small bowel in the larger bowl. Fill the large bowl with water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place a weight at the center of the plastic. Wait for your water.
An effective way to avoid caterpillars is to encourage birds to make their home in your yard. While this may not be an ideal solution for gardeners that want to keep the local avians away from their berry patch, it will certainly work for gardeners with plants that don’t appeal to the bird’s taste buds. To get birds to come to your yard:   Set out a bird feeder with a cone around it to keep out hungry squirrels and a birdbath to encourage the local avian populace to visit. Ducks and chickens also enjoy caterpillars and if one has the space they might add either for both bug control and the tasty eggs.  Placing mugwort, sage, thyme, rosemary, and/or peppermint* around affected plants may remedy some caterpillar problems. These strongly scented herbs will help disguise the creature’s favorite foods so that they head elsewhere for dinner.Intercropping, or placing different plants together in one area, is another way to confuse insect predators.  There are several organic controls that can be used to get rid of caterpillars. BT, or Bacillus thuringiensis, is an excellent option for keeping pests out of the yard. However, this substance is not always easy to find.To use BT:   “Kurstaki” BT kills most species of caterpillars. Mix it up according to the manufacturer’s instructions and spray the plants thoroughly, covering the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems. It can be sprayed on flowers and landscape plants every three to five days until the caterpillars are under control. Gardeners who cannot find BT should try Neem based sprays instead. These sprays should only be used as a last resort because a number of beneficial insects may perish along with the caterpillars.	Encourage birds to spend time in your yard. Hide plants by using strongly scented herbs. Use organic controllers to rid your yard of caterpillars.

Start by running the dryer for 10 minutes. This will soften the lipstick and make it easier to remove. You can alternatively use a hairdryer to heat up the specific spot which is being affected. This may be easier and more efficient to do.  With the drum hot, wipe the lipstick with a soft, dry cloth. Switch which part of the cloth you wipe with frequently, to keep from spreading the lipstick any more.   You can also try using a makeup wipe to remove the lipstick.  Unplug the dryer and then soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Use this to wipe off the remaining lipstick. When you've removed as much of it as you can, rinse with a wet rag or paper towels.  With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any product which might still remain.	Warm the dryer. Wipe off as much as you can. Clean out the remaining product with rubbing alcohol. Run a cycle with old towels.
Creeping Charlie, like other plants, needs light for growth. However, this plant can survive even in low level light, like strong shade. Because of this, if you intend to use this method, the light must be completely blocked to the plant., There are many items you could use for this purpose. For example, you could lay down a large piece of cardboard, a heavy drop-cloth, or a tarp over top the plant for maximum light blockage.   When creeping charlie is growing among plants you want to keep, you might consider cutting a circular hole around in a heavy cloth or tarp. This way you can block light to the creeping charlie around the wanted plant without denying it of light. Any surrounding plants that are deprived of light will die along with the creeping charlie. This likely means you'll need to reseed your plot later., Stray wind, animals, or other environmental factors can cause your light cover to shift in position. Stabilize your light cover by heaping some soil, rocks, or some other kind of weight on top of it to hold it in place.   To ensure the light is completely blocked, you should make sure that the cardboard is large enough to cover at least six inches beyond any protruding stems., In many cases, a week of light deprivation will cause the creeping charlie to wither and die, though depending on soil richness and other factors this can take longer. Peek under your light cover periodically to check whether or not the creeping charlie has died.   When you notice that all parts of the creeping charlie are withered, shriveled, and lacking in green color, the plant should be dead., There is a risk of creeping charlie reseeding even after the plant has died. In order to prevent regrowth, you should gather up all of its plant matter, including roots, and dispose of it by throwing it away or burning.   Be sure you wear gloves when handling or removing creeping charlie directly. Many people are allergic to this plant.Many places require you to request a burning permit to prevent false fire alarms. Be sure you have a burning permit before attempting to dispose this plant with fire.	Starve the planted of sunlight. Cover the area affected with creeping charlie. Protect your light cover from disturbance. Wait until the plant dies. Remove the plant and clear the area of remains.
Being a plant native to South Africa, tritoma does the best in hot environments. Planting the seeds in May or June allows them just enough time to develop before the temperatures elevate. Then, they will begin to bloom in the hottest months of the summer., If you choose to grow your tritoma inside, then make sure to keep the temperature set in the 70-75 degree Fahrenheit range. Peat pots are a particularly good planting container as they will provide both structure and nutrients.If you don’t have a peat pot available, almost any container will do. It just needs to be clean and have a depth of at least 3 inches to give plenty of room for root growth.  If you decide to grow indoors and then transplant outside, it will take about 7-8 weeks before the plants are ready to move. Make sure to transplant only after the final frost of the season to give the seedlings some time to get established. By this time your seedlings will stand around 2 inches tall.You can also tell that the seedlings are ready to move by looking at their leaves. They should have at least four full leaves. To transplant, grasp the seedling by the leaves, as the stem is too fragile. Use a spoon to loosen up the soil around the base. Apply a bit of pressure and lift the seedling and its roots out of the soil., This depth will provide protection from the elements, but it is also just deep enough for the seeds to still make it to the surface. Rhizomes, sprouts, or divided bulbs can be placed just slightly deeper at 7 cm because they are a bit hardier., Since tritoma can grow to be rather tall, it will need plenty of air circulation around it without being overshadowed by other plants. Ideally, try to plant each tritoma at least 20 inches apart. If the plants seem to grow closer together you can always thin them out later, too.Providing plenty of room for air circulation will lessen the possibility of your tritoma getting “damping off,” a fungus that breaks down the plant at the soil line., To keep your planting areas looking alive and active, place your tritomas alongside other plants that flower in the late summer months. Marigolds, in particular, work well with tritomas as they are low to the ground and easy to care for. The colors are also complementary with the red of the tritomas playing off of the orange and yellows in the marigolds.	Plant in the early summer. Start with indoor pots. Transplant the seedlings at 2 inches. Put the seeds at least 6mm deep. Leave at least 20 inches between plants. Pair them with other late-summer foliage.
Find a tint shop that has been in business for 5 or more years at the same location. This shows a stable business that will be there years down the road if somehow the tint goes bad.       Often times, successful tint shops open car tinting branches in neighboring cities. Although the installers of the branches may not be the master tint of the bunch, since opening new shops means training new employees; however, branches are a sure sign of a successful tinting business.      ; ,   Quality tint shops carry complete lines of window film from one or multiple window film manufacturers. They should carry dyed, hybrid, and metallic in a variety of colors and darkness. Beware of tint shops that only carry one or two lines of film, and sells them aggressively. They may have acquired this film on sale, and may not be thinking of your unique requirements and concerns.       The warranty on the car tint varies depending on the window film you choose. Try to install only window film backed with a lifetime warranty for materials and labor. Most films don't guarantee color and fading, it is recommended that you also choose one that does.       For the warranty to take effect, check out the window tint laws for your state. Illegal tint can nullify any manufacturer's warranty. When you purchase your tint, be sure sure you get a manufacturer's warranty card from the dealer with the date, the window film used on each window, and the total cost of installation as well as the receipt.    Tint shops can sound like the best shop on the phone, but 15 minutes on-site should tell you all you need to know.       Good dealers pay attention to customer service. They should be happy and willing to spend the time to talk to you and explain how their shops work. Remember, if they don't spend time with you now, they might not spend time with you when something goes wrong with your tint job down the road.       A tint shop's work area should be indoors and clean. Their tools and window films are organized in a professional manner. If the tint shop is outdoors or in a parking lot, this is a negative since it is critical to remove all dust and dirt from the windows before applying window film.       Take a look at a car they have already tinted, and look at the rear window. Is the window film applied in a single piece or is it cut into strips that surround the defroster lines. The best tint shops always apply film in a single piece. Look at the borders of the rear window, in many cars there is a black 'frit' edge on the window, Make sure the window film is securely attached to the frit as well.       Look for slices in window gasket material inside and out.       Look for nicks in the paint around the windows.       Pay attention to side-windows. The window film should be applied to the inside and be completely flush against all 4 edges of the window. Now look at the window film itself. Don't worry if the film looks slightly streaky and discolored, window film takes a couple weeks to dry out and become completely clear. If there are bubbles of air under the film or the film itself is not complete flat against the window, this is a sure sign of sloppy tinting.  Never compromise because there are plenty of other dealers out there that will offer your perfect tint. With these price quotes and your research on each tint shop, make the decision.  Even if they say "drop-ins accepted" or "bring it over any time", you want your tinter to be calm and prepared for you when you arrive. Tinting may take a couple hours to half a day, so either arrange a ride or go to a nearby coffee shop with a good book. Enjoy!	Find out how long they have been in business at this location   Good tint shops prosper despite local competition by offering good service at reasonable prices. Inquire about the types of film they carry, and what type of warranty they offer. Try to visit a few tint shops to see a sample of their work. Get price quotes from a few dealers for the exact darkness, color, and type of window film you want. Make your decision and then remember to make an appointment with the tint shop before you tint your car.
Immediately after a spill, clean up any excess spilled milk that is still wet or visible. This will help to remove spoiled milk smells from inside a car and make it easier to clean later on.Use paper towels, a white wash cloth, or a sponge and press it against any fabric or upholstery where milk has spilled. Continue padding the area until you have soaked up all of the moisture.; , Any fabric or area that has a spill on it and can be removed, should.Floor mats without plastic or rubber can be washed in a household washing machine. Spray the mats with a stain remover, and put them in the washing machine on warm. All other materials should be sprayed with a hose or washed in a tub with water and soap. Let the mats air dry in the house or outside in the sun.  Use a deep cleaning or steam cleaning vacuum to get deep-set spoiled milk odors out of your car. Many steam cleaners use solutions with special cleaning agents to eliminate food smells, which could help you get rid of the smell of spoiled milk.  Spoiled milk odors that persist after you've tried home remedies could be so deep in your car's upholstery that you can't reach them with simple methods. Consult an upholstery cleaning expert or a professional car retailer about having the car professionally cleaned and detailed to remove the spoiled milk odors from the car's interior.	Pat dry spilled milk. Remove and wash the floor mats and seat covers. Utilize a wet vacuum. Hire an expert.
There must always be a connection between your message, your style and public expectations. In short, you need to find your own secret formula.; , This is an example of how a 12-song rock album might be organized, but don't feel afraid to branch-out, just don't lose continuity:   Hard Rock Song 1 - Song to Set the Tone of the Album. (But this doesn't have to be in the exact "Hard Rock" style. A good example of "pumping up" the listener, but no using this exact format is AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" from the Razors Edge album.) Power Rock Song 1 - Fast and Catchy. Potential Album Single. (Led Zeppelin's "Rock 'n' Roll" from Led Zeppelin Four is a good example) Moody Rock Song 1 - Slow Down to Allow Last Song to Resonate. Power Rock Song 2 - Lift the Album's Speed Back Up Again. (Led Zeppelin's "Misty Mountain Hop" from Led Zeppelin Four is a good example) Hard Rock Song 2 - Medium Paced Song to Allow the Album to Flow. Dark Song 1 - Something to Catch the Listener Off Guard. Transitional Song - Almost Like a Second Introduction. Hard Rock Song 3 - Real Meat of the Album. Fewer "Hooks." Dark Song 2 - Dark Concept Songs Generally Work Better Later On. Hard Rock Song 4 - Substance With Little Gimmick. Purer Song. Power Song 3 - One Last Heavier Song to Complete the Album. Closing Rock Song - Usually Carries an "Ending" Theme With It.  Most artists will place their 1st album single at the beginning of an album while others will place it anywhere up to the 5th track slot. This list simply outlines the general industry standard called "Front Loading." This is where the album has a decisive flow with it's content perfectly streaming along the first half of the album. Most times the first half of the album holds many key songs in order to make the album sell. The second half of the album is generally there for the artists and true fans of the artist. Hence, the second half of the album is created to be almost a second chapter to the record. , Play gigs wherever you can to get the word out.	Define your trademark and intrigue the public. Choose your songs. Be aware that there are several variations to this formula. Make sure you have a unifying theme.  , Find an agent and/or publicist and begin to market your album.
Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation of 20 chain stitches.   If you do not know how to make slip knots or chain stitches, please see the "Tips" section at the end of this article.  Make three additional chain stitches, then work one double crochet into each stitch of your foundation chain. Chain three at the end of this row, turn, and work one double crochet into each double crochet of your previous row.   If you do not know how to double crochet, please check the "Tips" section for further instructions. This step and the one before it merely creates a foundation for you to work with when creating a cable stitch. These two steps are not actually part of the cable stitch itself. Note that cable stitches can also be worked into foundation rows of single crochet,but it is more commonly seen with rows of double crochet, half double crochet, or treble crochet.  Chain three, then double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.   This step starts the crossed cable row, or the row in which you'll make your crossed cable stitches. Crossed cables, in general, are made by skipping stitches, working a set of front post stitches, and returning to the skipped stitches to make additional front post stitches. In this example, you'll skip three stitches, and work cables across six stitches. The number of skipped stitches and stitches you'll work over may vary based on the specific pattern instructions you're following, however.  Skip over the next three stitches. In the fourth stitch, double crochet once into the front posts only.   Work the front post stitch by inserting the hook through the front of the post, behind it, and back out to the front of the work.  Work one double crochet into the front posts only of the next two stitches, giving you a total of three front post double crochets lying side-by-side.   Note that these stitches should all be slanting to the right.  Return to the first of your three skipped stitches and double crochet once into front posts only. Double crochet once into the front posts only of the second and third skipped stitches, as well.   This step creates a cross cable with stitches that slant to the left.  Work one double crochet into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.   This step completes one crossed cable stitch row.  Turn the work and chain three. Skip the first stitch of the previous row, then double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.   You're starting what is known as a "wrong side" row in this step. This row will balance out the cable row and help keep the overall work lying flat.  Work one double crochet into the back posts only of the next six stitches in the row.   Work a back post stitch by inserting the hook through the back of the post, in front of it, and out again to the back of the work.  Work one double crochet into each stitch until you reach the end of the row.   When you reach the end of the row, you've completed one wrong side row.  You already have a full crossed cable at this point, but you should alternate between the crossed cable row and the wrong side row as often as needed until the cable pattern becomes as long as you would like it to be.   Once the pattern reaches your desired length, the process is complete.	Create a foundation chain. Work two rows of double crochet. Double crochet across the beginning of your cable row. Front post double crochet into the next stitch. Repeat twice more. Front post double crochet into your skipped stitches. Double crochet to the end of the row. Double crochet into the start of the next row. Back post double crochet into the next six stitches. Double crochet to the end of the row. Repeat the two rows as needed.
Clean the top edge of the truck bed behind the cab with some rubbing alcohol on a rag. Cut weather strip with scissors to the correct length to reach across the area you just cleaned. It should go from just inside the side rail across to the other side rail.  Drill 1 and 1/4 hole with the hole saw through the plastic factory plugs located near the bottom corners of the truck bed behind the cab. Now push the drain hose through the holes you drilled., Have someone help you place the canister across the truck bed side rails behind the cab. Center the canister with the same distance from each side. It should be approximately 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm)., The side rails kind of lock into the canister ends. Place in and push forward. Now go to the back and lift the side rail slightly and close the tailgate. Hold the side rail down and make sure there is a slight space between the bottom of the side rail and the tailgate so the side rail does not interfere with the tailgate closing. Do the other side rail the same., Measure the cover across. Use this measurement plus approx. 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) for clearance. Place shims provided, between the underside of the cover side rail and the pickup truck side rail to achieve this measurement all the way from front to back. Use the clamps and tighten them as you go. Three clamps per side starting from back by the tailgate end., In the center of the canister under the cover there is a small bracket. Pull the cover ahead and lock it there. Remove the nut where the bracket should go, turn the bracket up and replace the nut you removed., Make sure there is at least an inch of hose sticking through the holes you drilled in the plastic plugs. Leave enough hose to reach the drain nipples under the canister on each side and cut the hose off and connect it to the nipples. In addition to the canister there are also drain nipples back near the tailgate in the side rails.  You need to drill holes in the rib of the truck bed side just under the drain nipples in the side rails. Place the rubber grommets provided in the hole and place drain hose on the nipples and out through the grommets.  Place the cover on the canister and thread in the four 10mm bolts and tighten them down. Place the plastic caps provided in the holes to cover the bolts., There is an adjustment to finish off the install that you should watch at the end of the video. You finish the adjustment by drilling a 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) hole and using the screws provided to secure it.	Install weather strip behind cab. Install the drain tubes. Install the canister. Install side rails. Shim the side rails. Take care of the center bracket. Add the drain tubes. Finish off the canister. Adjust the cover at the rear.
The frame is the base of the bike, and the most expensive part you can buy. Getting a new frame usually means buying a brand new bike -- unless you have amazing brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your old bike, it is rarely cost effective to buy a new frame and transfer everything over. When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight.    Carbon-fiber: The gold standard for light-weight bikes, carbon fiber is unfortunately a bit brittle. You will quite often see it on mountain bikes as the technology has progressed over the years so be careful if you decide to buy a second hand carbon bike. Racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively carbon fiber.  Titanium: Stronger as steel but much lighter, titanium is another high-end option often found on mountain and road bikes.  Aluminum: Strong and light, aluminum frames are the most common frames you can buy for any bike.  Steel: Sturdy but heavy, steel is most common on old bikes, which are less concerned with lower weights.; , Perhaps the best "bang for you buck" fix is to get lighter wheels. You will not only lose weight, you'll become remarkably more aerodynamic. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of lighter material will all help lighten your bike. What constitutes an "upgrade" depends on what you currently have, however, generally speaking, you can't go wrong with a few sure-fire light fixes:   Carbon-fiber wheels Tubular wheels, not recommended for anything other than racing as they require special tires that are difficult to install and replace. Aero wheels, Mountain bike tires, which are big and knobby, are going to kill you going up a paved hill. If you find yourself riding more roads than trails, purchase a set of commuter or "cross" tires, which are lighter, offer less friction, and can still accommodate light trails riding. Slicks are also a viable choice for light trails such as footpaths.  Look at your chain rings, which are the big metal gears next to your right pedal. If you have three, you should consider purchasing a "compact crank," which gives you two chain rings. While you'll have less gears to work with, you will loose weight.   If still want to keep the gears but lose the weight, you might compromise with an extra gear in the back, known as your cassette. That said, many riders find that, after 1-2 weeks of riding a compact crank, they forget they ever had a third ring.  Carbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, like triathlon bars, will shave off weight and dampen some of the vibrations around your hands on bumpy roads. Remember, however, that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle so if you crash, be sure to get it checked at your local bike shop., There are a lot of additions people put on their bike that, unfortunately, do nothing but add weight. Get rid of any unnecessary saddlebags, lights, fenders, mudflaps, pumps, decorations, and reflectors, especially if you are riding on a dry day outside of a city.If you're going on a short ride, drop any extra water bottle cages, though you should always have at least one water bottle present unless water will be provided by the race. These will only shave a few grams off your total weight -- hardly worth it if you remove a bike light that will protect you on busy roads.  While this is mostly for racers, lighter, shoes and aero helmets cut down weight keep you quick, and look professional. They can get expensive, however. You can also swap out your pedals for racing pedals and wear light-weight shoes that attach to them.  Not for the faint of heart, race trimming involves shaving off every possible gram of weight you can. Professional rider Jack Pullar is perhaps the most extreme example, as he ripped off the seat covering and drilled holes out of his saddle, then sawed off the bottoms of his handlebars, to loose weight. While you should be careful, some race modifications include:   Sawing off your seat post 1-2 inches below where you have it set. Trimming the ends of all your cables and cable housings. Removing water cages and bolts., Unless you're willing to shell out $15,000 for a high-end, pristine 11lb bike, you're not going to be losing that much weight, ever. Switching a lighter group set (your gears) and derailleur, for example, saves the equivalent weight of 1/3 of an iPhone 4.You will not notice the difference. If you're entering the Tour de France, you'll want the absolute lightest bike you can get. Otherwise, stick to a few bigger, cost-effective fixes and work on getting stronger legs, not a lighter bike.   If you've got nice wheels and still want a lighter bike, get a carbon fiber seat or light, small pedals first. They won't make a huge difference, but they will make the bike lighter.	Get the lightest frame you can buy when you get a new bike. Switch out your wheels for easy, immediate weight loss. Make sure you're using the proper tires. Switch to a double crank in your front gears. Pick up aerodynamic handlebars. Remove any unessential hardware. Wear an aerodynamic pair of shoes and helmet. Consider race trimming your bike if you feel comfortable with mechanics. Know that you are usually saving grams, not pounds.
Romance is all about the senses so engage and heighten your sense of taste and smell during this romantic activity.   Name that wine (or beer). Have your partner select a few of your favorite wines (or champagnes or beers) and line up glasses for you to sample. The idea is that you have to describe the smells and flavors exuding from each glass and then guess what type of wine you are drinking. If you want to stay within one family (for example Pinots), take it one step further and try to name the winemaker. Test each other over candlelight to add ambiance. Try different types of romantic food. Choose a line of exclusive, silky chocolates or sample foods that are known to be an aphrodisiac (like oysters or honey). Use a blindfold and feed each other. Then have the blindfolded sampler describe and then name that food. Try to pair similar foods so you don’t end up with a stomach ache (very un-romantic). For example, try a line of sweet foods together or something salty. Identify that scent. Certain scents are known to trigger romance so perform a similar activity as you did with food but use scents instead. Use scented candles or oils as your medium and choose from vanilla, rose, musk, caramel or strawberry amongst others.; , In the days of Shakespeare or Elizabeth Barrett Browning, travel back to the days when a well written, hand scribed letter made lovers swoon.   Send each other romantic poems that you have either written or taken from a famous poet. Exchange letters containing one of your favorite romantic poems or try your hand at writing an original love poem to your sweetheart. Set up a secret mailbox for letter delivery. In the book, “Little Women” the girls exchange secret letters with boy pal Laurie through a hidden mailbox. The secretive mailbox and special location will add a clandestine, intimate element to your activity. In addition to leaving letters, consider adding romantic treats with your letter such as a single rose or a piece of decadent chocolate. Write letters using Shakespearean language for added romance. Travel back in time and try your hand at writing in Shakespearean prose to your betrothed. Show your lover how you pine for him/her and describe your love using references from Shakespeare plays as examples.  Kick your night up a notch with a little romantic scavenger hunt. Leave clues for your honey that will ultimately culminate in an evening together.   Provide clues before your sweetheart arrives home or at your house. Clues could even begin while your betrothed is at work (for example, an email could tell him/her to walk to the car and find the first clue). Provide hint and riddles to lead him/her to you. Include fun, inside jokes or stories as clues (such as referencing your favorite movie as a couple or the place where you had your first date). Set the tone for romance throughout the house. This means that the kids should spend the night at the neighbor’s house (or your mom’s) as you prepare for an intimate evening. Turn on soft music and dim the lights for an ultra romantic effect. Light tea candles to line the walkway as he/she arrives and sprinkle rose petals throughout the house. Leave a special treat when he/she finds each clue. Sweeten the scavenger hunt with a piece of candy, a bottle of wine or a rose along with each clue. You could even make your treat part of the clue or hint for the next destination. Keep the activity short but sweet. Don’t take him/her on a lengthy, wild goose chase, but instead keep it short and sweet. Leave between five to 10 clues.  Get a little sexy and intimate with your activity. From body painting to naughty movie drinking games, add a little spice to your romance.   Have a rude food dinner. Definitely adults only, so send the kids either to bed or to a sleepover. Create phallic-shaped bread or design a banana split he/she won’t soon forget. Examine food shapes to create hilarious, rude shaped food. Some possible tools include bananas, grapes, melons, squash and zucchini. Chocolate body painting. Somewhat traditional, but always fun, try your hand at chocolate body painting. Numerous adult novelty stores offer specialty chocolate body painting or you can make your own mixture at home. Choose your favorite type of chocolate (dark, milk, etc.) and combine with 17.5 ounces of chopped chocolate with 13.5 ounces of cream. Heat using the double boiling method and stir special enhancements if you desire (such as fresh mint, freshly brewed espresso or ground chili pepper). Play a naughty movie drinking game. Grab your favorite bottle of wine or alcohol, along with a good adult film and play the naughty movie drinking game. Choose a random word, name or action in the movie. When that cue becomes apparent take swig of your beverage until the film ends (hopefully you won’t be passed out).	Explore your senses with blindfold taste testing. Romance each other with old fashioned love letter writing. Arrange a romantic scavenger hunt for your lover. Get a little raunchy.
If your toilet has become clogged, don't try to flush it or you'll risk overflowing the toilet. Find the water valve on the wall that connects the waterline to the toilet and turn it clockwise until it stops. Water should stop coming into the tank.   With any tank or flushing issue, you'll want to shut the water off first as a safety precaution. Cleaning up a toilet that's overflown is obviously the biggest of bummers.; , It's called the plumber's helper for a reason. Some plungers have complicated bulb shapes and some are simple suction cups, but you just need to make sure your plunger is big enough to cover the opening at the bottom of the bowl.   Make sure there's enough water in the bowl to cover the cup of the plunger. It's easier to have some water to force the clog out with, but now that you've shut off the water you can't flush anymore in from the tank. Get a few cups of water from the sink to add to the bowl if you need to.  Pump it forcefully and evenly. You should start to hear a gurgling in the pipe and feel some pressure building if you've created a suction with the plunger. After 5-10 pumps with the plunger, break the seal and see if the clog comes loose. If not, try again.   If you can see the clog come up, you can try to flush the water down without turning the water back on. There should be enough water in the bowl to flush it. If the water all flushes down by itself after plunging, turn the water back on and let it run for a few minutes. When the water settles, try flushing it, but watch carefully and make sure it doesn't start to overflow. Shut off the water quickly if it does.  If the clog is close to the top, the plunger should get it. If it has worked its way down the pipe, however, you might need the heavy artillery. A plumber's auger, also called a "snake," is essentially a long wire that you can reel out and guide through the pipe to forcefully dislodge the clog and then reel back up.   Aim the tip of the auger into the bowl drain and reel it out. Be very careful not to force it and crank slowly and evenly. You don't want to bust a pipe fitting or get the auger stuck. When you've run the auger out, or feel that you've broken up the clog, reel it back in and try to plunge the toilet again or flush it and see if the clog has worked it's way through. If you don't want to buy an auger, you can fashion a simple device with a wire hanger to try to get at the clog.	Shut the water off. Get a plunger. Fix the suction cup onto the opening at the bottom of the bowl. Use a plumber's auger or a "snake."
This is the quickest way to find out if Formula 1 is right for you. It is ideal for older racers that are new to the sport. You will get to get behind the wheel of a Formula 1 race car and learn some of the basics of racing.These classes may have a substantial fee for a few hours of racing knowledge, but it is the most affordable way to gain knowledge about Formula 1 racing before you decide to make a larger financial commitment.

If your hair is any color other than jet black, you’ll have to dye it. You can go to your local hair stylist and have them dye your hair or you can buy dye from a local store and do it yourself at home.   If you need to look like Shino for a long period of time, you can use permanent dye that will last until your hair grows out. If you only need to look like Shino for a few days, temporary henna hair dye will do the trick. If you really don’t want to dye your hair, you can use a wig, but it may not look as natural.; , Wash and dry your hair and comb out any tangles. Squeeze a quarter size amount of hair glue in your palm, rub it between your hands and work it into your hair. Starting at the base, use your thumb and forefinger to create spikes that stand straight up. Repeat the process with the rest of your hair.When you’ve finished spiking your hair, Spray a copious amount of hair spray all around it to ensure your spikes stay up.   If your air is curly or wavy, you may need to use a hair straightener before creating spikes. Use hair glue designed to hold hair straight up. If you use hair gel, your spikes may fall.  Draw the leaf village symbol on a piece of metallic paper with a sharpie. Cut the metallic paper into a rectangle with an x-acto knife and smooth out the edges. Cut a long thick strand of black fabric for your band. Fold the fabric and sew the edges together. Leave one end of the fabric unsewn and pull the band inside out through it. Sew the remaining end of the fabric together and superglue the metallic paper to the center of your headband. After the super glue dries, wrap the headband around your head. Make a mark on the back of your headband where both sides of it meet. Cut off the excess cloth at your mark and sew both sides together so that your headband fits snug.After your fabric is folded, it should be the same width as your piece of metallic paper. .  It should have a long collar that covers half your face. Shino wears a jacket that is too large so that others don’t see his bugs burrowing into his skin.  Shino never shows his eyes. His sunglasses help him to hide his emotions and intentions from his opponents.   If you can, find glasses with circular lenses like Shino’s.  Cut them around eight inches shorter than your leg. Get some white tape and wrap it around your right thigh. Then get some black tape and wrap it around the same thigh on top of the white tape.   There should be thin strip of black tape in the middle of the white tape. Brown sweatpants may work best. Shino battles often and needs pants that allow him to be as mobile as possible.  You can order these from a cosplay site like cosplayfu.com or you can make your own. Use scissors to cut the tops off of an old pair of sneakers leaving only the soles and the back of the shoes. Put on a pair of blue knee-high socks and make a mark on them at the top of your index toe. Take of the socks. Cut them at your mark and pull them over the shoes. Slide your feet into your newly designed shoes. Your toes should be exposed., Shino is a master strategist. He often uses false attacks to plant bugs on his opponents that slowly drain their chakra. (life energy) Educate yourself in combat strategy the way Shino does to gain the edge on his opponents.   Smoke out your enemies and inwardly declare war so that you can strike without warning. Focus your mind on the present moment. Learn to detach yourself from chaos to make rational decisions. Learn to read your opponent. Pay attention to your enemy’s behavior., Shino’s favorite hobby is insect watching. Observe the actions of various bugs and study them as much as you can. You may not be able to command hordes of bugs the way Shino does but you can train insects to go where you want them to if you know what motivates them.Ants follow lines of sugar. Spiders tend to flee away from the heavy streams of air from a hair dryer.  Shino keeps his emotions hidden, making it difficult for his enemies to read his intentions. Practice hiding your emotions. Be sure to watch out for body language that could betray the way you feel.Uncross your arms and don't clench your neck when you're feel defensive. Relax your stare and loosen your fists when you feel anger.  When Naruto returns to the village after three year, he doesn’t recognize Shino. Shino holds a grudge against him for the rest of the series. Don’t let anything go, at least while you’re Shino Aburame., If people ask you questions, respond with short answers. For example, if someone asks you what you do for a living, respond with a simple “I’m a businessman,” or whatever it is that you do. Don’t give any further details.Don’t feel any need to explain yourself. Let people wonder about you.  When Shino does talk, he says exactly what he means. Don’t sugarcoat the truth. For example, if someone asks you if you like their cosplay outfit, say either “yes I do,” or “no I don’t.” .   Make sure people know you’re speaking in character so they don’t think you’re a jerk.  When daily nuisances arise, don’t get worked up. Instead, focus on ways to solve them.   If you stub your toe on a couch while your getting ready, don’t get mad and kick the couch. Rather, rearrange the furniture so the room is less cluttered reducing the chance of you stubbing your toe again. If you have a flat tire on the way to a cosplay convention, don’t waste time cursing and being upset. Calmly, replace the tire with your spare and carefully drive to the nearest automotive shop.  Shino Aburame takes control of situations. Be firm with people and don’t let them take advantage of you.   When someone cuts in front of you in line at a cosplay event, calmly demand that they move to the back of the line. If you go out to eat with your friends after the event and a waiter brings you the wrong food, calmly alert the waiter to mix-up and ask for the food you ordered.	Dye your hair. Spike your hair. Make a leaf village headband. Wear a light gray jacket that is much too large for you. Wear black frame sunglasses. Wear brown pants that that are loose fitting. Wear blue sandals with blue coverings over the top. Learn combat strategy. Be fascinated by insects. Never show your emotions. Hold grudges. Be very mysterious. Be blunt. Make decisions based on your judgement rather than your emotions.Shino is always able to calm his emotions so he can accurately read his opponent. Be assertive.
This galaxy jar is simple and easy to make. Because you will be painting it with glow-in-the-dark paint, you can use it again and again. Here's a list of what you will need:Mason jar Glow-in-the-dark paint Paint brush Paint pallet or paper plate Rubbing alcohol; , It would be a good idea to do this, even if the jar looks clean. Any dust or dirt that's on the jar will prevent the paint from sticking. Be sure to scrub off any labels and glue residue.  Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe down the jar. Be sure to get both the inside and the outside. This will get rid of any residue and oils that the soap missed.  You can use any color of glow-in-the-dark paint, but colors such as yellow and orange might look more like stars than purple and green. Glow-in-the-dark paint usually comes in two different forms: liquid paint and puff paint. Liquid glow-in-the-dark paint is just like any acrylic paint and needs to be put in with a paintbrush. Puff paint comes in a bottle with a pointy tip. You can draw with it straight from the bottle.   You can find puff paint in the t-shirt and fabric paint section of an arts and crafts store. It may also be labeled as "3D paint" or "dimensional paint." It has a slightly raised surface when it dries.  It will be easier to dip your paintbrush into a little puddle of paint than into a bottle of paint. Do not pour out too much paint at one time. Most acrylic paints dry quickly. If you pour out too much paint, it may dry up before you finish using it.   If you are using puff paint, you don't need to do this, because you can apply the paint straight from the bottle.  You can paint inside the jar or outside the jar. Painting on the outside will be easier, but the paint will be more likely to get scratched off. Painting on the inside will be harder, but the paint will last longer.   If you are using puff paint, simply take the cap off, and start making little dots all over the jar.  This will make your jar resemble the night sky even more. Look up some of your favorite constellations, and try to copy the pattern onto the jar. Orion, the Big Dipper, and the Little Dipper are popular ones.  Most paints should dry within two hours, but some paints (such as puff paints) may take longer. Read the label for more specific drying times. Once the paint is dry, you can put the lid back on. This is not necessary, since there is nothing inside the jar that can fall out.   The sunlight will also activate the glowing particles in the paint.  If the jar does not glow, you might need to leave it under a bright light for a little longer. Most glow-in-the-dark paints need to sit under a bright light for at least two hours.	Gather your supplies. Clean the jar with soap and water. Wipe the jar down with rubbing alcohol. Choose your paint. Pour a coin-sized drop of paint onto a pallet or paper plate. Dip the paintbrush into the paint, and make small dots on the jar. Consider painting some stars, planets, or constellations. Leave the jar in the sun so that the paint can dry. Take the jar into a dark room and watch it glow.
It's important that everything about your new cello look, feel, and especially sound appealing to you. If you only test one and assume that it's the perfect fit, you might miss something better. As you go along, do not pay attention to or ask about the price or brand of the instruments (yet!). Instead, ask your accompanying expert what they think of the sound, and try to pick a few that you'd like to physically test later after giving them all a thorough inspection.Have your teacher or selected expert inspect the cellos as well.  Although it might be tempting to treat buying a cello the way you might buy clothes (finding the perfect brand name and sticking with it) this is probably not the best way to go about it. Although there are perhaps some brands that should be avoided, most that you'll find in a store should be generally reliable. Talk with experts you trust, and ask other cellists (who you may know through orchestra or lessons) about which brands they might recommend, but try to experiment with a range of cellos across different brands.  The size of the cello that you will need is based primarily on height: cellists who are 5 feet or taller should generally be able to use a full-size cello, and those from 4 - 4½ feet tall should seek a half sized cello. Those who are in the middle between those two sizes will probably be more comfortable with the smaller cello.Due to the cost of a cello, you may wish to take into account whether or not there is a high likelihood you will continue to grow; most girls reach physical maturity around 15 years old, and boys around 16 or 17, and until then you may continue to grow.To determine if a cello is the correct size for you, sit in a chair from which you can comfortably rest your feet on the floor. Make sure your back is straight. Pull the endpin out a foot in length and allow the instrument to rest at a 45 degree angle against your chest. The top of it should come to the middle of your chest, with the peg for the C string situated near your left ear., Most shops will have a quiet area for you to test a cello out in, but some will also allow you to take it out of the store to test in other areas. If they do allow the latter, take advantage of this and test the cello in spaces you will commonly play--your home, wherever you take lessons or practice, the orchestra or band hall--to conduct additional tests.   You should be on the lookout for good tone and playability that is consistent whether the instrument is directly underneath your ear or all the way across a very large room. Unfortunately, there is no science to this step; you will have to make the choice based on your own instinct and your mentor's advice.One sign of a quality cello is the presence of the occasional wolf note, wherein the vibrations between the instrument and the string itself cancel each other out so quickly and repeatedly that the note stutters as it's made.	Choose a variety of instruments for inspection. Don't select cellos solely by brand. Be sure it's the correct size. Test it out.
Go through the music and choose stuff that you have never heard before, but you are still comfortable with listening to.; , Set the music selection genre to random, or choose one genre and let the music play on its own. If the song that gets played randomly makes you feel nothing then skip it and go to the next. But if the song captured your attention then in another tab explore the artist's discography to find some other works you might like. Don't be bias towards any particular genre and explore everything. Maybe even classical music. YouTube is a great idea if you already know the genres you're looking for.  Most colleges have a radio station run by the students. Since the student DJs can pick their own music, these stations usually are a good place to hear new non-commercial stations. Internet radio stations are also often a good source of new music.  Many other sites have this feature.  Choose an artist you like, and click on the "Related Artist" tab and click a random link. Do this a couple times and you just may find one of your new favorite bands.  A lot of the bands are pretty decent, but hide the song titles from your friends!  , If, for example, you find a nice symphonic metal group with a female singer, you'll probably find lots more under the "female metal singers" tag.  You will be able to hear songs similar to what you have chosen.  Music is meant to enhance the quality of your life. Chasing "acceptable" music may deter you from enjoying varied artists that have a lot to offer than the commercially produced music. It is important that the music you choose to listen to everyday makes you happy because it is the soundtrack to the story of your life. Imagine if your life were a movie being played out then what kind of songs would you put in there? Would you keep songs you don't particularly like just because they are acceptable to other people? Or would you want to keep music that inspires you, makes you feel myriad of emotions and reflects what is going on in your own personal life? Be able to be comfortable with your taste in music.	Contact a friend that you know who listens to unique music, and tell him/her to send you his/her favorite music. Go to random music sites and listen to different types of music. Listen to non-conformist radio stations and get ideas from them. When you do find an artist you like, search for their CD at Amazon and check out the "People who bought this also bought..." part. Samgoody.com is another way to find different artists to listen to. Search for Wizard Rock on Google. If you find an unusual artist, look it up on Last.fm and see what shows up under their tags. Go to Pandora once you find a musician or song you're interested in, and create a "station" with that song or musician. Have confidence in your taste.
Some guitars are around $1000, or if you're in the market for a Les Paul, $3500. Basically get the best guitar you can afford to get at the time. It makes a difference.; , They might have to put it under their name if you are under 18.  Only withdraw the money when you're going to buy the guitar.  It is very important that you decide the exact make and model and that you stick to it.  Don't only go to the extremely large ones, but try to find some small, privately owned ones also. Check there for your guitar and start writing down the store name, price, whether it is new or used, and what condition it is in. This should start to get you a good idea of how much it will cost.  Don't get anxious and buy the first guitar you see. You need to wait it out. After 2 or 3 months, you will find an amazing deal., They will help you decide if it is in good enough condition, and will keep you from buying it on impulse. Don't be afraid to do this more than once. If the guitar is not right for you, keep waiting.  Guitar stores always mark up prices, and with a little pressure, you can make them bring it down, especially if it is used.  Good things to say:  "Well, I don't really have quite enough right now..." "I think I saw it cheaper at (insert store)." "Um... I think I'm going to shop around a little more... maybe find a better deal." "If you take 100 bucks off the price, I'll take it off your hands right now."    ,	Find some income. Open up a savings account at your or your parents' bank. Put as much money as you can in there, and make sure when it goes in, it doesn't come out. Decide ahead of time which guitar you want. Every weekend, call, go online to, or go to some local guitar stores. Be patient. When it comes time to buy the guitar, take a friend that plays guitar with you to get it. Once you decide on buying it, make sure you haggle. Now you have that guitar you've always dreamed of, and you don't have to go broke.
You want the stems to be at least 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) long. You can use just one type of flower, or a variety.   Daisies and dandelions are classical, but you can also use alyssum or forget-me-nots. Flowering herbs, such as mint, thyme, oregano, chamomile, and lavender work as well. They will also smell great.  This will make the flowers easier to braid and take off any unnecessary bulk.  This will keep the flowers fresh while you work. Braided flower crowns can take a while to make, and the picked flowers may wilt by the time you get around to using them.  Wrap a small piece of wire around the stems a few times, and snip the excess off. Try to get wire as close to the blooms as possible. You want all the blooms to be at the same level; if one sits higher than the other, your crown will look uneven. The wire will hold the flowers together while you braid them.   If you don't have any floral wire, use twist ties or thread instead.  Take the left stem and pull it over so it ends up between the middle and right stems. Take the right stem and bring over so that it ends up between the left and middle stems. Keep doing this until your braid is 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) long., The new flower should sit just beneath the one that is already in the braid.  Keep them together; they will count as one stem.  The new flower should sit just below the flower that is already in the braid.  Don't let the stems spread apart. Try to keep them together and think of them as one thick stem.  The sections you are braiding will get thicker and thicker as you continue to add flowers.   Try using different types of flowers. This will add color, texture, and beauty. Don't be afraid to weave in a few leaves, vines, or grasses.  You want the garland to be a little large, because you will be overlapping the two ends. This will make the crown more secure in the end.  Place the wire just beneath the blooms of the last bunch of flowers. Wrap the wire around the end of the garland a few times, then snip the excess off with a pair of wire cutters. This will hold your flowers together and keep the garland from unraveling.  Overlap the ends until the crown sits comfortably on your head. Hold the two ends together as you take the crown off.  When you come across a flower, thread the wire underneath the bloom. You are binding just the stems together. Once the crown is secure, snip the excess wire off. Gently tuck both ends of the wire into the braided stems.	Choose flowers with thin, flexible stems. Cut the stems so that they are all the same length and trim off any leaves. Put the flowers into a bowl filled with cool water. Hold three flowers and loosely tie them together using piece of floral wire. Start braiding the stems together. Add a flower to the left stem. Bring both stems over so that they end up between the right and middle stems. Add a flower to the right stem. Bring both stems over so that they end up between the left and middle stems. Keep repeating the last few steps until you get the length you want. Stop when the garland is just a few inches too big. Wrap some wire around the end of the garland. Bring both ends of the garland together. Wrap wire around both ends to hold them together.
Being called by the muse is a wonderful thing, without a doubt, but without the technical abilities to realize your vision, you won't get very far. Whatever your chosen medium or media, become an expert in every part of it.   Set aside an hour or more each day to devote to nothing but practicing your technique. Focus especially on those areas that are the weakest for you, but build your strengths as well. Take advantage of the communities and resources that you can find. Artist supply manufacturers, and art stores themselves, often have free literature, tutorials, videos, and websites that are loaded with tips, techniques, and more. Some stores even offer weekend training seminars, where you can not only pick up some new skills, you'll also meet other artists.; , Choose one subject that is meaningful to you and that you want to be able to draw well.   Start with a still life, or a photo that's yours, in public domain, or that you have permission to use. Draw or paint that same photo over and over, using different approaches—paint, pencil, abstract, realism—whatever moves you. Build up from easy subjects, like a rubber ball or a rectangular block, to more complicated, difficult subject, like a rose, a clear glass marble or a shiny metal bowl. And try to get the details right: the curves of a petal, the clarity of the glass, or reflections so good that Escher would be impressed! Each of them will improve your ability to draw in general. Practice timed gesture drawing. Pick your subject, set your timer for two or three minutes, start drawing, then stop when the timer goes off, even if the drawing isn't finished. Set the timer again and start over. Doing 10 three minute drawings will give you more skill than taking half an hour to draw the same thing in detail.  Start off with a pencil, then go to charcoal, colored pencils, pastels, paint, whatever interests you. Never fear trying new tools or techniques.   When trying an expensive new medium, visit Dick Blick or Jerry's Artarama and email them for samples. Many types of art suppliers make sample sized products or the company will send out just one stick or a small piece of the expensive paper or canvas for you to test before deciding what to buy. This gives you a chance to try it first and see if you like it. Try more than one brand—the samples are usually not the same color and you can find out which brand to invest in by those trials.  Make it clear you want a real opinion, not just a biased, "I love you so everything you do is wonderful" opinion. If they think it's good, then you're on the right track! If they don't, you're still on the right track: if several people think your technique is great, but your subject matter leaves something to be desired, that's an opportunity for self-reflection and to learn something.   Don't confuse critique with personal criticism, especially if the critic is somebody who is not interested in seeing you become an artist.  Look for critique from people who draw better than you do. Make friends online with real artists whose work you admire. Compliment them and ask intelligent questions about their techniques. You'll rapidly find that many artists enjoy teaching beginners and will be happy to share what they've learned.   As you learn more, reach out to those who are just starting. You will learn more every time you explain and demonstrate what you already know. It's very common for teachers to learn from their students!  , When friends and family members love everything you draw and think it's wonderful, or your mum was putting your childhood scribblings up on the fridge from the time you were two (and believes you'll be Picasso someday), relax and enjoy that as support.   The better you get at art, the easier it is for people to compliment you and call you talented. Compliments can sometimes be critiques, and those are very valuable! Should an artist whose work you admire give you a compliment such as, "I love the colors in this," this means they are not only nice enough to compliment you on your work, but have taken the time to understand and appreciate the choices you made.  Do this by learning to paint and draw your favorite subjects in all the ways that every painter you like best has done them. The more you learn technique and understand your own passions, the more your own style will emerge.   Having a personal style is a combination of learning to draw and paint well in your favorite mediums while consistently paying the most attention to your favorite subjects. You will become a specialist, a "brand of one" at a certain intermediate level of competence. Mastering a subject and a medium comes later, at the point when you could do it easily without thinking at all about how you do it, yet always have consistent results.  To get into a gallery, you should have a portfolio of up to a dozen of your best works, all of which have something in common, be it the subject or style, general size and level of skill.   Make your work available in as many formats as possible, so that there are no barriers for interested gallery owners or art patrons to view your work.  The best way to become famous is to get known! The internet offers many avenues to be seen and promote artistic works, and in the information-loaded 21st century, it's important to use all the tools at your disposal to build your name and your reputation.   Blog daily about your work, and include illustrations showing your process and a gallery to show (and/or sell) your finished works. Visit all the galleries in your area, and get to know the proprietors. If you're old enough, attend as many openings as possible, not to promote your own work—there will be time enough for that later—but to become a known artist in the community. Create a Facebook for your art, and encourage people to visit and like your page. Reach out to other artists through Facebook. Like visiting galleries, this will help place you in the community, and Facebook can reach well beyond your neighborhood. Tweet about art regularly. Your art, historical art, pop art, any art at all. The more you know about art, the more you'll be recognized as somebody worth paying attention to. At the same time, follow artists and galleries, and respond to their tweets. This will encourage more people—including gallery owners—to follow you. Create a Flickr account and post scans or photos of your art. It's an active community, and while you won't get a lot of helpful critique on Flickr, you will build your name recognition, and perhaps become online friends with some very talented artists.  Start with student level contests at first and small local art contests.   Teach workshops. This will help you not only get known as an artist, but also as an expert in your field. Build your skills until you can enter major national and international contests in your chosen medium. Enter juried art shows. Getting a painting into a juried art show is itself an achievement to put on your resume. When you have too many, shorten it by listing only the most important shows.  Read up on art agencies and contact the agent's other clients. See if they are happy with the agent, or are generally discontented or feel as if they've been ripped off. Agents will market you and your work, and also represent you in contract negotiation. Make sure they are well-connected and good with contracts.   You might also want to work with a reputable attorney who specializes in the art world. While an agent may know a bit about the law, their job is promotion. A lawyer's only job is knowing about the applicable law.  If you don't care about the subject, it will show in your work. Many artists fall a little bit in love with their subject, whether it be a bowl of fruit or the artist's model.   If you like expressing anger and dark emotions, study dark painters. If you like abstracts and splatter paintings, study them and do them—they take their own techniques and don't just happen because someone threw paint at a canvas and called it art. If you love wildlife and the outdoors, get a small portable painting kit and paint "en plein air" (outdoors) in your favorite places. Whatever your passion, find ways to capture that passion on the canvas.  Being a true artist is a lifelong pursuit. When you've reached the level of fame to which you aspire, with plenty of money and acclaim, you will still want to look forward to something beyond that.   Continuing to learn and invent, even after you are famous will not just keep you on top of your game, focused on the future instead of putting your best years behind you. As you style grows and changes, older paintings you've done become more valuable. Collectors will be interested in the entire history of your life's work. Even the drawings you did as a child become valuable: what your mom stuck to the fridge has the seeds of your current success, so don't throw away earlier works.	Practice. Work on the things you love. Vary the art tools you use. Get critiqued by family and friends. Look outside your circle for opinions. Learn to accept compliments gracefully. Develop a strong personal style. Be prolific. Publish your work. Join fine art societies and enter contests. Find a reliable art agent. Paint what you care about. Keep growing as an artist.
This is a great way to dry leaves for crafts, but some color fading will occur. Place fresh leaves on top of two paper towels. Cover them with another single layer of paper towel.   Use freshly fallen leaves that are still vibrant and pliable. Avoid leaves that are curling at the ends or those that have rips or rotted spots. For best results, leave a little space in between each leaf to prevent them from sticking together as they dry.  Place the leaves in the microwave and heat them for 30 seconds. Afterward, continue microwaving the leaves in 5-second intervals.Autumn leaves will generally need to be microwaved 30 to 180 seconds before they are sufficiently dry. Be very attentive when microwaving leaves. If cooked too long, leaves can actually catch fire. Leaves that appear scorched have been microwaved too long. Leaves that curl at the ends after being removed from the microwave have not been microwaved long enough.  Store the leaves in a draft-free, shady area. Leave them there overnight, at minimum, or for two days, at maximum. If you notice a change in color, the leaves should be sealed immediately.  Spray both sides of each leaf with clear acrylic craft spray to preserve the remaining color. Let the leaves dry before using them as decorations or for crafts.	Sandwich fresh leaves between paper towels. Microwave the leaves to dry them out. Let the leaves sit out overnight. Seal the leaves with craft spray.
Lift the new toilet and place it so that the anchor bolts go through the holes in the base of the toilet. It will be easier if you remove the new tank first and only put in the base, if the toilet came pre-assembled.  Rock the bowl back and forth a little and press it firmly downwards, either by pressing with your arms and hands or by sitting on the toilet. This will help seal the new wax ring.  At the base of the toilet, put in the new washers and nuts. Do not immediately put them on tight though! Place a level across the seat of the toilet and use wood shims underneath the base to make sure the toilet is level. Then, tighten the nuts on each side, alternating between the two sides, tightening just a little at a time to make sure the toilet is kept level. Do not tighten the nuts too much: you don’t want to crack your new toilet!   Make sure you’re being careful at this point not to move the toilet too much, as this will cause the seal on the toilet to break.  Place the new caps on the anchor bolts. If they are too high, you can trim them down with a hacksaw.  Next, take the new tank and place it on its side. Insert the tank bolts and washers from the inside of the tank and then put the tank-to-bowl gasket around the hole at the base.  Take the tank and place it on the main part of the toilet, so that the bolts fit through the appropriate holes. Then add washers and nuts and tighten them, alternating sides as you did with the toilet base. Make sure not to make it too tight.	Place the toilet. Seal the wax ring. Replace the nuts and washers. Place the bolt caps. Insert tank bolts and gasket. Place and secure the tank.
Staying busy with activities that are meaningful to you, however, can be energizing. Focus on devoting more time to doing the things that really matter to you. Get inspired and busy yourself with activities that will move you closer to some of your life goals.   Make a list of your life goals. Include the loftier ones that feel more like dreams than goals, too! The list is your road map. Plot out what steps need to be taken to reach each goal and then get started.; , You probably have at least one hobby in your life that you really enjoy, if not more. Concentrate on one or two of them. Become an expert! If your hobby is an artistic or creative pursuit, put some time and energy into becoming more skillful at it. Even hobbies that don’t seem action-oriented on the surface can be explored deeply.   For example, if your hobby is reading, you can start in on that stack of novels you’ve been meaning to read. But don’t stop there. Research new authors and explore new genres. Start a blog and write reviews of the books you read. Join a book club.No matter what your hobby is, there is always a way to take it to the next level.  Or you could get busy with a project at home, like replacing all of the curtains, building a piece of furniture, or painting the walls a new color.   If you are coordinating an event soon, you can focus on that as a project. For example, you could finally rebuild that classic car you’ve had stored in the garage for months.  For instance, maybe you want to improve your writing or Photoshop skills. If you enjoy cooking, try taking a cooking class. Love yoga? Sign up for a program at your local gym. Technical school classes and on-the-job training are great ways to develop and increase your skills, as well.   Taking a formal class isn’t the only way to approach this. Be your own instructor and educate yourself! For example, perhaps you have some specialized knowledge on a topic that you can develop further by doing internet research, checking out local libraries, visiting museums, etc.	Do what you love.Keeping busy with menial tasks and other day to day activities can become exhausting. Pursue a hobby. Focus on a project.If you’re in the middle of a work or school project that you’re enjoying, really throw yourself into honing your skills and making it a success. Take a class.Sharpen some of your current skills by signing up for an online college course on the topic.
While this treatment can be effective throughout different seasons, it is usually easiest to apply it during the late fall, after most foliage has died off.   Do not use the cut-and-paint method during early spring. Privet sap flows upward at that time of year, so the exposed stump will quickly become damp and sticky after you cut it, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the herbicide.  Herbicides made with glyphosate or triclopyr amine are best. Mix either herbicide with water to form an appropriate solution.   When using glyphosate, choose a concentrate with 41 percent or higher. When using triclopyr amine, choose a concentrate with 44 percent or higher. For either glyphosate or triclopyr amine, combine 32 fluid ounces (945 ml) with enough water to make 1 gallon (4 L) of prepared solution. If you'll need to postpone chemical treatment after performing the cutting, you should use 26 fluid ounces (770 ml) of a triclopyr ester herbicide mixed with enough diesel or bark oil to create 1 gallon (4 L) of solution.  Cut down the privet stem, leaving only a short stump. Remove any sawdust from the site before continuing.   Any cut you make should lie beneath the lowest branch of the stem. Cuts lying at ground level are best, but the process should still work as long as the stump is low and there are no branches left on the remains. If the privet is larger than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, you may need to drill holes into the stump to improve the effectiveness of the herbicide. Use a 10 mm drill bit to create downward holes in the cut surface, spacing them 4 inches (10 cm) apart.  For the best results, you should immediately paint or spray the cut area with your prepared herbicide solution.   One of the easiest ways to apply the solution is with a spray bottle. Cover the entire cut area until it becomes moist, but do not allow the herbicide to drip off and form a puddle around the stump. Herbicide application should usually be performed within minutes of the cutting procedure. If you cannot do so, apply an appropriate triclopyr ester solution within two or three weeks of cutting.  If done correctly, every treated privet stem should die off, making a second application unnecessary in most cases.   If the privet does not die off within one or two months, however, you can attempt to reapply the herbicide solution following the same procedure.	Apply this treatment during the fall. Mix an appropriate herbicide solution. Cut down the privet. Paint the privet with the herbicide solution. Reapply only if necessary.
Making a garden trellis is not difficult, but it does require some special tools and materials. To build a garden trellis, you will need:         miter saw or circular saw drill sander eye and ear protection eight boards measuring 1 ½ inches x 1 ½ inches by 8 feet lots of 2 ½ inch exterior grade screws tape measure pencil; , Take your 8 foot long boards and measure them to the dimensions that you need for this project. Use your pencil to mark the boards where they will need to be cut. You will need to measure and mark your 8 foot boards so that you will end up with:         four 72 inch boards seven 48 inch boards several small pieces (about 6 inches) to use as spacers (optional)  , After you have finished measuring and marking all of your boards, you can use your miter saw or circular saw to cut them. Use the pencil marks that you made on the boards to cut the boards to the required dimensions.         Make sure that you wear your ear and eye protection when you use the saw. Watch your fingers and be very careful when cutting your wood pieces. If you are worried about cutting the wood or if you do not have a saw, then you can also consider getting them cut at the hardware store.  Do your best to smooth out any rough edges on the ends of the boards.You can use a power sander or a manual sander to smooth out the ends and edges of your boards.          Start with a coarse grit sandpaper such as #80 grit and then advance to a finer grit sandpaper as you remove the larger flaws in the wood. For example, you might finish sanding the trellis edges with a #150 or #180 grit sandpaper.Don’t forget to wear your ear and eye protection if you are using a power sander.  Lay out two of your 72 inch pieces so that they are parallel with each other. Then, place two of your 48 inch pieces on top of them so that they resemble a picture frame. Next, screw the corners of the 48 inch boards the corners of the 72 inch boards.         Place two screws into each of the four corners to keep the trellis from pivoting. You can make pilot holes before you place your screws to help prevent the screws from splitting the wood, but this is optional. If you decide to make pilot holes, then they should be as big as the smallest diameter of your screws.Use a smaller sized drill bit that is as long as your screw to create the pilot hole before you place the screws.  After you have created the frame, you should have two 72 inch pieces left. Measure along each of your 48 inch frame pieces to determine where to connect your last two 72 inch pieces. These two pieces should be evenly spaced between the other two 72 inch pieces.         Secure the ends of the 72 inch pieces to the 48 inch pieces with a couple of screws.  Measure the two outer 72 inch boards and place pencil marks to indicate where you want to place your five remaining 48 inch boards. You can place them wherever you want, but make sure that these marks are even with each other so that the boards will be straight.         To get a sense of how to space your boards, you can start by placing one board so that it lays across the centers of the 72 inch boards. Then place the other four pieces in the spaces that are left. Consider how you plan to use the trellis before deciding where to place the boards. For example, you might like to have a couple of boards lower to the ground to hang a planter. After you have decided where each of the boards should be placed, secure them with screws.  If you want to leave a gap between the back of your trellis and the wall, then you can add some spacers to the back of your trellis. You can also add spacers to the front if you plan to hang something from the front (such as a planter or trough) that may sag without a spacer.         If adding spacers to the back of your trellis, secure them to each of the four corners as well as a few in the center. If adding spacers to the front of your trellis, then place them wherever you think you may need them. Use your drill and a screw or two to secure your spacers.  Use your drill and screws to secure your trellis to a wall or sturdy fence. Place screws at each of the four corners of the trellis as well as a couple of screws in the center to secure your trellis in place.         Make sure that the screws that you use are long enough to go all the way through the trellis and into the wall behind it. For example, if you have placed spacers at your corners, then you will need screw that are at least five inches long to secure the trellis to the wall.	Gather your tools and supplies. Measure and mark your boards. Cut your boards. Sand the ends and edges of the boards. Create the frame. Connect your last two 72 inch boards to your 48 inch boards. Secure your other five 48 inch boards to the frame. Add spacers if desired. Hang your trellis.
Metaldehyde is a natural compound which is used as a pesticide for killing snails, slugs and other gastropods. It is highly effective, however it is also toxic, so it should not be used in home gardens where pets such as cats or dogs are allowed to roam freely, or where it runs the risk of being consumed by small children., Iron phosphate is a molluscicide used for killing slugs and snails. It is the main ingredient in commercial slug repellents (such as Sluggo Plus) and as it is only harmful to slugs and snails, it is a much better option for people with children and pets., Crush garlic and mix with water. Leave for a few hours to allow the garlic to "marinate". Add to a water spray can and spray your flowers, plants and herbs for a natural slug and snail repellent.	Use metaldehyde. Use iron phosphate. Make garlic spray.

; , Try a local web-based service first. Advertising there is sometimes free and will let those in your local area know about what you are offering. , They will send someone to pick up your car and give you a receipt for a donation. You may be able to use this as a tax deduction. They will probably not use your car, but rather, will have an agreement with someone who will sell it at auction.  Old models are especially good for this. Car buffs are always searching online auction pages in order to find compatible parts (e.g., headlights, turn signals or bumpers) for their model of car.   Call around to local mechanics and junkyards to see if your car has value for parts or as scrap.	Decide whether to sell your car, give it away, or chop it up. Consider not wasting too much money on advertising. Think about donating your car to a family member or someone who needs it.  , Consider donating to a local charity which accepts car donations. Sell pieces of your car if none of the above will work for you.
To bedazzle your sneakers with crystals or rhinestones you will need:          A packet of flatback crystals or rhinestones. How many you need will depend on how much of the surface of the shoes you intend to cover. A tube of e6000 adhesive. This is a very strong craft adhesive which will prevent your rhinestones or crystals from coming loose. It should only be used in a well-ventilated room. A jewel setter. This is a small plastic stick which has a ball of wax on one end. It is used to easily pick up and set small jewels during craft projects. If you you don't have a jewel setter, you can use a pair of tweezers. You will also need a piece of sandpaper (or an emery board), some rubbing alcohol, a clean cloth and a pair of sneakers.  Although you can apply crystals or rhinestones to any part of the sneaker you like, only applying them to the rubber toe of Converse-like tennis shoes creates a very cool, designer-style effect. However, in order to do this, you will first need to prepare the rubber:          Take the piece of sandpaper or emery board and rub the toe of your sneaker for a minute or two. This roughs up the surface of the rubber, creating a better surface for the adhesive to bond to. Take the clean cloth and dip it in the rubbing alcohol. Rub the cloth over the sanded rubber toe to remove any rubber residue or dust. The alcohol will dry very quickly, so you can proceed with your crafting immediately!  , Take the tube of e6000 and apply a thin line of adhesive around the toe of the sneakers, in a semi-circle from one edge of the fabric to the other. You should only work with a single line of adhesive at a time, as it dries very quickly.          Open the pack of crystals and lay them out on the table beside you, shiny side up. Take the jewel setter and press it gently into a single crystal to pick it up (don't press too hard or it will become embedded in the wax). Press the crystal gently onto the prepared line of glue. Use the opposite (pointed) end of the jewel setter to press the crystal firmly onto the shoe. Continue adding more crystals along the line of glue, using the same technique.  Add a second semicircle of glue just inside the first row of crystals, then add a second row. Continue in this fashion until the entire toe of the sneaker is covered in crystals.          Once you have finished with the first sneaker, repeat the process with the second one. Then leave the adhesive to set for 15 to 20 minutes. You can use the same technique to add crystals or rhinestones to any part of the sneaker you like -- you bedazzle the entire shoe, or use carefully placed crystals to create stars, hearts and other patterns.  If you used the jewel setter, your crystals or rhinestones may look dull rather than shiny.          This is because they are covered in a layer of wax. Take a clean, dry cloth and use it to buff the crystals until they are clean and shiny. Don't worry if any of the crystals come loose -- just apply another dot of adhesive and stick on a new crystal.	Gather your supplies. Prepare the sneakers. Start adding the crystals. Continue adding crystals. Buff the crystals or rhinestones.
Being able to see properly is key to driving safely any time, especially when visibility is already reduced because of rain. To improve your visibility:Clean the inside and outside of the windows regularly to remove dirt, dust, mud, smoke, fingerprints, grime, and other materials. If your windows fog up, turn on the air conditioning or cold air in the car and aim the vents at the windows. Turn on the rear defroster, and open the windows if necessary to increase the airflow.; , Take your car to a mechanic to have your headlights adjusted properly if you’ve never done this. This will ensure your headlights are pointing in the right direction, make it easier to see, and prevent you from blinding other drivers.Check regularly to make sure none of your lights have burnt out, and replace dead lights immediately. This includes headlights, brake lights, turn signals, tail lights, and running lights. Keep the light covers on your car clean so that dust and dirt don’t reduce their efficacy.  Tire tread is what allows your tires to adhere to the road, which is why it’s so dangerous to drive with bald tires. Without the right traction, you can skid, slide, and hydroplane easily in wet conditions.   New tires generally have about 10/32 of an inch of tread. Tires should be replaced when the tread gets to 4/32 of an inch. Tires with 2/32 of an inch or less of tread are unsafe and shouldn’t be used., Along with keeping your windshield clean, you can also improve your visibility in wet conditions by ensuring that your wipers are up to the job, and by using the right washer fluid.Replace your wipers every year to prevent them from cracking, breaking, or not sealing properly when you need them most. Try a hydrophobic washer fluid that will cause water to bead up and drip off your windshield, rather than sticking to it and blocking your view.  During any inclement weather or unfavorable driving conditions, your first reaction should always be to adjust your speed accordingly. Wet roads reduce your traction, and slowing down reduces the chances of you skidding out, and will give you more time to react to emergencies.   Wet roads can reduce your traction by about a third, so you should also reduce your speed by a third.Even small amounts of water can make the road more slippery, because the water mixes with oils on the road, and this creates a greasy layer. Driving too quickly on wet roads can lead to hydroplaning, which means that your tires lose contact with the road. When a car hydroplanes, you have very little control in terms of steering or braking.  When you're behind the wheel, it’s important to always pay attention to the road, other cars, and pedestrians. This is especially true in the rain, when you cannot see as well, and your ability to stop may be hindered by the slickness of the road. Stay focused by:Keeping your eyes on the road at all times Paying attention to what drivers and pedestrians are doing around you. Turning off the radio, and ignoring your cell phone and other electronic devices. Ceasing any conversations you were having with passengers. Not eating, reading, or putting on makeup while driving.  When it starts to rain, turn on your headlights immediately, regardless of whether it’s day or night. In some states, it’s actually illegal to drive without headlights when it’s raining. There are two reasons why you should drive with your lights on in the rain:   First of all, your headlights will make it easier for other drivers to see your car. Second, rain typically means cloudy skies, and turning your lights on will help you see the road better., You should always drive with your hands at 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock on the steering wheel, because this gives you maximum control if you have to turn, swerve, or react quickly. It’s especially important to have both hands on the wheel when driving conditions are subpar.   While traditional wisdom said to drive with your hands at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock on the steering wheel, this increases the chances of injury from airbags in case of a collision., You should always leave a three- to four-second gap between your car and the car in front of you, and you should increase this to at least five seconds when it’s raining.Not only does this give you more time to stop or adjust if necessary, but it also prevents reduced visibility caused by the spray from other cars.   To determine how many seconds you are behind another car, make note of when that car passes a landmark (like a street sign) and then count how many seconds it takes before your car passes that same landmark. Leaving space includes leaving an opening where you can escape quickly if necessary. To do this, make sure you always leave at least one open space beside or in front of you that you can move into.  Slamming on the brakes can cause you to slide forward, and you won’t be able to control the car. Hitting the brakes too hard can also force water into your brakes, making them less effective.Instead of braking, you can also slow yourself down by easing off the accelerator, and downshifting if you have a manual transmission. Not being able to stop as quickly in the rain is another reason why it’s so important to leave extra space between your car and the one in front of you.  Turning too quickly on a wet road can cause your tires to hydroplane, and this means you won’t be able to control the car, and could skid out. Whenever you have a turn coming up, signal early and start slowing down sooner than you would in good conditions.Just like with driving, you should reduce the speed of your turns by about a third when it’s raining.  Cruise control is another factor that can lead to hydroplaning. The weight of the car shifts slightly when you ease on or off the accelerator, and this helps the tires maintain traction with the road. But with cruise control, because the speed of the car is constant, there is no weight shift, and the car can lose traction., Never be afraid to pull over to the side of the road if you don’t feel comfortable driving. If you can't see the sides of the road, the cars in front of you, or your surroundings at a safe distance, pull over.Other things that can reduce your visibility include the glare from other car lights and lightning. You may also need to pull over if there's too much water on the road, the road is too slick, or you simply don’t feel safe. To pull over safely, turn on your signal, check your mirror and blind spots, pull over as far as possible to the side of the road, and turn on your four-way lights.  Driving through deep or moving water can be hazardous for a number of reasons, including that you could get stuck, stall out, damage the car or the electrical components, or be swept away.Moving water is too deep if you cannot see the ground. Don’t proceed through deep water if it comes higher than the bottom of your door. If you encounter these types of road flooding, turn around and find another route. In a case where the only route is blocked, pull over and wait out the flooding.  Hydroplaning can occur at speeds as low as 35 miles (56 km) per hour, and when it happens your car may not react when you turn the steering wheel, and your back end may feel loose. In the event that your car does hydroplane:Stay calm Avoid turning the steering wheel Ease your foot off the accelerator Apply slow and gentle pressure to the brakes  , Skidding on a wet road can be particularly frightening, but like any emergency situation, the key is remaining calm. Then, look where you want to go, ease your foot off the accelerator, and gently steer in the direction you want to travel. Avoid braking, and never slam on the brakes.To prevent skidding, always brake before entering a turn or curve, then let your foot off the brake before the turn.	Keep your windows clean and clear. Maintain your lights. Maintain your tires. Turn on your windshield wipers. Slow down. Stay focused. Turn your lights on. Drive with both hands on the wheel. Stay five seconds behind the car in front of you. Avoid slamming on the brakes. Take turns slowly. Don’t use cruise control. Pull over if necessary. Turn around if you encounter deep or moving water. Be prepared to react if you hydroplane. Know what to do if you start to skid.
You will only need:Scissors. Paper (best if it is somewhat rigid). Tape  , Any size will do, but obviously a small sheet of paper will make a small hoop.  You will create a crease that ends at the midpoint of the top and bottom sides.  Make sure that you make all of your folds in the same direction; in other words, do not make one fold toward you and the other fold away from you. All of the creases (including those in the next step) must leave an imprint on the paper point the same direction.  Make sure that each corner and the sides match up perfectly as you fold. The paper should now have four creases in it, and will almost take a pyramid shape if left to sit on its own. It will only come together correctly if all four of the creases meet at a single central point.  Do not bent against the creases you created earlier. As you bend the four together, the diagonal creases will flow outward. The paper should appear to be a triangle if looked at from the side and a four-pointed star if viewed from above.  You may be able to get the hoop to maintain its shape just by flexing the paper (especially if the paper is rigid). If the paper will not maintain the hoop shape on its own, you can tape the tips together.   The tip of the triangle or pyramid from earlier is now usually considered the top. As you fold the tips together you may note how easily they form a basket that opens wider toward the top.  Again, masking tape usually works best.	Obtain the necessary materials to make the hoop. Cut the paper into a perfect square. Fold the paper in half top-to-bottom, and then unfold it. Then fold and unfold the paper again, this time left-to right. Fold and unfold the paper along both diagonals. Fold all four of the mid-side crease points together at once. Curt two adjacent tips of the paper toward each other to make a hoop. Attach the basket to a wall with tape.
This type of cast-off requires two knitting needles. It will create a tight edge without much stretchiness. Replace your right-hand needle with a larger one if you want it to have a little more give., It often works best to continue following the project's pattern on this row, though you can also knit or purl across. This will leave you with two stitches on your right-hand needle and the rest of the project still on your left-hand needle.  Use your fingers to gently lift it up and over. The second stitch will now form a loop around the yarn leading to the first. Keep the remaining first stitch on the right-hand needle.  The new stitch should now be the one closest to the point of your right needle, while what was previously the first stitch is now the second. Continue to follow the project's pattern if you're using one. These stitches will functionally be your final row.  Keep adding another stitch to the right needle and pulling the older stitch over it and off the needle. Work until the last stitch of your project is alone on your right needle. Be extra careful when doing these stitches, as they will make up the edge of your project. The quality of the stitching will be much more apparent than with the inner rows.  Make sure to leave a tail of free yarn between one to five inches long. Leave a longer tail if you plan to sew or weave this piece to another. For weaving, leave at least 12 inches.  Remove your piece from the right-hand needle. Tug the tail until the final loop is closed and secure. Trim off any extra tail yarn unless you will be adding to it later as previously discussed.	Pause before starting what will be your project's final row. Start by doing only the first two stitches of the final row. Pull the second stitch on the right-hand needle over the first and off the needle. Add another stitch on the last row. Repeat the process as described above. Cut the yarn to free your project. Pull the tail through the loop of the final stitch.
If choosing root division, divide the roots in spring or autumn.; , Echinacea likes light, loamy soil. While it likes full sun, it will also tolerate dappled shade. Also ensure that the site is open and airy as echinacea is prone to mildew; look for the hot, dry spot in the garden.  The soil should be kept moist.  The roots and rhizomes can be harvested in autumn/fall. If using in tinctures, you'll need to dry the root or rhizome first.   This plant will self-seed readily provided it had adequate mid-summer watering.	Choose to grow from seed or root division. Select a suitable part of the garden. Water regularly. Harvest.
Make sure all buttons/zippers/designs etc. are above your cut. Cut it at the length you want it to be. If you want to carry books and heavy items, use a heavier and larger shirt. If it's just for clothes or beach items, any shirt would work. Cut a straight line across. Using a pencil or chalk and a ruler to get a straight line. Don't throw away the sleeves though.; , This will be the top of the bag. Notice how it is already sewn for you.  Use a double stitch for support. , Do not cut the sleeves shorter than they already are. Cut a straight line where the curve for your armpit stops. Make sure the bottom it all straight. One sleeve is good for both straps.  This will result in one piece of flat fabric.  This divides it into two straps. Make sure both are equal in length and width.  Press the sleeves flat. This step is optional.  Make sure your bag is still inside out while you are sewing.	Cut your shirt. Turn the shirt inside-out and make sure the lower hem is at the top. Sew the bottom cut together. Press all seams.  , Cut the sleeves for straps. Cut the sleeve open. Cut your sleeve in half lengthwise. Sew hems on both straps for a clean finish. Sew your straps on your bag. Turn the bag right side out and use.
This can help you to know what it's about and what others have thought of it. You can read reviews to see what others have to say about it and how many stars they rate it. And if you don't mind spoilers, you can read a synopsis of the film. For some people, knowing what will happen reduces the fear but not the thrill because it helps take the edge off.   Try looking up the plot on Wikipedia or IMDB (Internet Movie Database) beforehand if you don't mind spoiling the movie for yourself. It helps to know what happens when, so if you think you might get scared by that part, go to the bathroom or get a refill on snacks.; , Perhaps the content is not of interest to you or maybe the reviews have canned the film and it seems a waste of time. Or, perhaps the reviews are glowing and you're keen to find out more. Decide whether or not you want to watch the horror movie.  A way to stop getting scared is by watching the non-gory ones first, the ones with a great deal of suspense, and slowly move into the most frightening and gory ones. Keep in mind that gory does not mean scary and the movies are not necessarily scarier when they're gorier. Some horror movies without blood are actually scarier than some of the really gory horror movies.  If it is dark you may not want to have to wander the halls alone.  Having some comfort objects might help you to feel safer and will provide something for you to clench if the movie gets especially scary for you.  There's no need to be trialing this alone!   Never watch alone if the movie is really scary. Watch it with people like your family members or friends. This will help.  If you're really scared, you can watch the movie through your fingers.  Or, turn away. , Reminding yourself that it's just a movie with special effects (and sometimes a bad script) can help you to remember that it's just a gory play on film and not reality.   Try laughing at all the unrealistic parts. For example: Bad effects for blood, unrealistic bodies, fake fear, dumb-looking monsters, etc.  Notice how the scenes were created so you can know how unreal the movie really is. This can help prepare you for future horror movies too.  Something loud, horrific and gory is probably going to happen.	Read about the movie before you watch it. Use what you've read about the movie to decide whether or not you want to watch it. Consider starting with the right level of horror movie. Go to the bathroom before starting the movie, especially if it's at night. Gather together some pillows and blankets to make a cozy area or even a fort. Watch it with someone else. Peek rather than watch. Cover your eyes during the scary parts. Peek through your fingers slowly, and then cover your eyes again.  , Keep saying to yourself, "This is not real!", Watch the commercials on how the movies were made. When there is suspenseful music playing, brace yourself.
In order to create a smooth braid, you will need to have tangle-free hair. Freshly washed hair is the most difficult to braid because it is so slick, so use one day old (or several days old) dirty hair for your headband. You can use wet or dry hair, although if you begin with wet hair it will be wavy when you remove it from your braid at the end of the day.; , Your braid will be giving the illusion of a headband, so it needs to cross from ear to ear. Use a comb to create a smooth, even part running horizontally across your head from behind one ear to the back of another. Try to avoid any jagged lines or waves in your part; the straighter the line the better it will look. Pull back the rest of your hair into a ponytail.  Comb your hair horizontally across your head, starting at the base of one ear. When it is smooth, section your hair into three even pieces at the base of your hair.  Use the three pieces of hair to start a traditional braid. Take the section on the right, and cross it over the middle section of hair. Then, do the same with the left section, crossing it over the middle piece.  As you braid, pick up small pieces of hair from your parted section in addition to your regular three sections. Pick up a piece on the right, add it to the right strand, and cross it over the center. Pick up a piece on the left, add it to the left strand, and cross it over the center.  Work your way across your head above your hairline, adding in more strands of hair as you go. Your braid may have been thin to start, but will begin gathering size as you add more strands.  As you get close to your ear, finish the braid by tying it off with a small clear elastic. The loose ends of the braid will blend in with your hair down, or can be incorporated into an updo. You can also choose to braid your hair in a regular braid to the very ends, and then tie the tips off with a ponytail.	Brush your hair. Create your part. Section your hair. Begin braiding. Incorporate more strands. Continue braiding. Finish your braid.

Belts make a good base for a guitar strap. Find an old belt that you don’t use anymore. You will be removing the buckle that makes the belt useful for clothing. You are basically going to strip the belt of any extra parts and leave the belt in its raw state.  Use scissors or a sharp blade to remove the buckle from the belt. Place the belt around your shoulder as you might hold a guitar. Most belts will need to be cut to better fit a guitar. You can also make adjustments so that the strap can be adjusted.; , Use a strong string material like paracord for the guitar strap. Don’t use anything too slim or else it may break. If you have extra rope, you can arrange multiple lines for the strap by twisting or gluing them together. Measure the string by draping it over your shoulder and hold your guitar.A good length is one that will allow you to make adjustments. You might need a friend to help you measure the strap.  Instead of a belt or string you could also use fabric as the base of your guitar strap. It will be important to layer the fabrics on top of each other to create a durable base. Arrange about three or four layers of fabric on top of each other and then cut out an outline for the strap. Measure out the width of the shoulder the strap will rest on.  A durable fabric like denim may work best. Trace the dimension onto the layered fabrics before cutting. Attempt to make a clean cut. Attach the fabrics together by sewing them or by using glue. Many synthetic fibers like acrylic tend be more durable than natural fibers., Go to a linens shop and search through the raw linens. This is the best way to find a unique fabric design that you can use for your guitar strap. There are plenty of options for the guitar strap’s design. Pick out a fabric design that suits your style and music.  For instance, classic paisley is a design that was popular in the late 1960s.  Look through your wardrobe or linens closets to see if you have anything that you don't use anymore. This is a great way to truly personalize your strap. If you have a favorite t-shirt or bed sheet that you no longer use, it could be great as a cover for your guitar strap base. This will add an element from your past that could inspire you to play a certain way.  Use something that you'll feel comfortable playing with. Don't choose something that you might be embarrassed by. Tie die will especially look good if you like this type of look.  The fabric you selected will act as a cover for the base of your strap. Lay out the base of your strap on a surface and wrap the fabric over the base. Make sure the fabric fits tight around the base. Once your cover is snug and covering the base, cut off any excess fabric from the cover. Sew the cover onto the base using a simple cross stitch. The base of the strap should stay in one place and not move around too much.  It may benefit you to glue your fabric to the base before sewing to ensure everything stays in place. Don’t forget to sew the fabric at the ends of the strap closed.  You can add plenty of extra features and designs, based on your style. Some players will choose a minimal strap design, while others like to make their strap burst with personality. You can add studs if you’re into hard rock or metal. You can also be creative and stitch patches or other linens to the strap.Add fray to your strap if you want to have an eccentric cowboy look. You could even glue glitter onto your strap. This style works well for glam rock.  The second most important area of the strap is the shoulder section that will be holding the brunt of the weight. This is where comfort comes into play, which is very important if you're going to be standing for an extended period of time.   The wider the strap at this area, the more space the weight will be distributed over, and the less sore your shoulder will be! Padding is a great thing to add to this area as well. Foam or a similar material can easily be attached to the underside of the strap using glue or needle and thread. You can get fancy and glue Velcro onto the padding and the strap for removable padding. If you construct your strap with two pieces of material, you can sandwich padding between them.  You can setup your guitar strap to fit the strap pegs using string. The string you choose needs to be a durable material like paracord. You should also try to use a thin string. Create a hole in the guitar strap using an awl or leather punch. Create a hole just large enough to weave the string through.  Tie the string to the top end of the guitar strap and connect it to the top strap peg on the guitar. You can alternatively use a knife or scissors but an awl or leather punch will be easier. Consider a good length for your guitar strap before attaching the string - string can be difficult to adjust later if you change your mind.  You can buy authentic guitar strap tips that you can attach to your homemade strap. This is a good way to ensure your guitar strap will be secure enough to hold the guitar while playing. You can either find these online or make them yourself. You need a strip of leather to make them from home.  Measure out the width of the strap and outline that width on the leather. Cut out two pieces of leather. Look at guitar straps for an example of the end’s curvature. The end typically gets narrower towards the hole.

Sweep or blow away all the dirt and debris from the concrete steps. Also, make sure to cover up any nearby plants with a plastic covering like a tarp or trash bags.Remove toys, decorations, and nearby furniture as well.  Mix them together in a plastic bucket until they are well-combined. The temperature of the water should be at least 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius).Alternatively, you can use a specially formulated concrete cleaner instead of the oxygenated bleach and water. You can find these at your local hardware store.  Fill a tank sprayer with the solution. Working from the top down, use the tank to spray the steps with the solution, focusing on the stained areas. Once you have covered the whole area, let the solution set for 20 to 30 minutes.Make sure the concrete steps are soaking wet to prevent the solution from drying up while it is setting. If the solution starts to dry, then just spray more solution onto the steps. You can purchase or rent a tank sprayer from your local hardware store.  You can also use a push broom to do this. Working from the top down, scrub the steps until the dirt and grime are completely removed. Use a smaller scrub brush to clean small crevices and corners.Make sure to clean the steps evenly to avoid a patchy look.  Fill a gallon bucket with clean, hot water. From the top of the stairs, pour the water down the steps to rinse them clean. Rinse the steps until all of the soap residue, dirt, and grime are removed.If the concrete steps are still dirty, then repeat steps one through five, or use a different method.	Remove debris from the steps. Mix one part hot water to one part oxygenated bleach. Spray the steps with the solution. Scrub the steps with a long handled brush. Rinse the steps with hot water.
There are several types of swings available. For instance, you might choose a wicker porch swing, a metal porch swing, or a wooden porch swing. You can get porch swings in a rainbow of colors, so choose a color that suits your porch and pleases the eye.There is no functional difference associated with the different types of colors or materials of the porch swing. Your choice of swing is entirely based on your personal preference.; , Chains of stainless or galvanized steel are the most common option. However, if you’d rather have a hanging porch swing with a more rustic look, you could use marine-grade braided nylon rope or polyester rope.Your ropes or chains will likely need to be at least seven feet long. If you use rope, ensure it is at least ¾’’ (19 millimeters) thick. Whatever you choose, ensure you obtain two equal lengths of each, one for each end of your porch swing. If you choose to hang your swing with rope, check it regularly for signs of wear like fraying threads.  You should plan on your porch swing moving through an arc that extends through about four feet of space. In other words, hang your porch swing at a spot with at least three feet of space in front and in back of it. Use a measuring tape to determine where your porch swing would fit best.If you’re hanging a prefabricated A-frame porch swing, you won’t need to look for beams and joists in your porch ceiling, but you will still need to ensure your porch is deep enough to accommodate the A-frame. Compare the frame’s depth against your porch’s before purchasing.	Choose your swing. Choose between steel chains or rope. Give your swing lots of space.
Lampworking is the process of manipulating molten glass over a small torch. Lampworking is used to create beads, for example, or other smaller objects, like paperweights. This section will focus on how to lampwork a small bead.  You could use an oxygen and propane fed torch if you have access to one.  Try to get a stainless steel mandrel with a ceramic coating. The ceramic coating will keep the molten glass from sticking to the mandrel when you want to take it off.  If you don't flash the glass, it could go into shock and shatter instead of becoming molten. Flash for about 30 seconds.  Hold it in the flame until a nice orange ball develops.   Keep rotating your glass so that it maintains its round shape.    Place the glass onto the mandrel and begin wrapping the mandrel away from your body. Wrap until you have full coverage on your mandrel. Use the torch flame to sever the glass rod from the mandrel. It's easiest to cut the glass away from its source when both it and the mandrel are in the flame.    If desired, add another color to the existing bead. Do this by following Steps #4 through #7, all while rotating the mandrel and occasionally dipping it back into the flame. This is not for beginners, as it requires dexterity and use of both hands simultaneously.  Use the paddle to:   Create better edges Create square shapes Help even out the contours of a curve.	Use lampworking for smaller glass objects. Turn on your torch. Heat the mandrel up in the blow torch slow. Flash the glass through the tip of flame to prime it. Start bringing the glass closer to the heart of the flame. Attach the molten tip of the glass to the mandrel. Introduce the mandrel with the glass bead back into the flame, rotating to keep the glass from slipping down. Take the mandrel out of the flame and shape, as necessary, with a graphite paddle. Allow the mandrel to cool off a bit before taking it to the annealer, rotating all the while.
If you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team. These teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs. They usually sign their drivers on a season-to-season basis.  Most Formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track. To attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion. You may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on-track work. Racing is a very expensive sport, so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible.  Pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports, including Formula 1. Instead of being paid by the race team, the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations.While this isn't practical for most new racers in Formula 1, it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it.	Accept an offer to drive for an F1 team. Getting sponsorships. Pay to drive in F1.
You must remove everything covering the "rough frame" of the doorway.The majority of doors for sale on the market today come pre-hung--that is, they are already mounted on a door jamb. When installed correctly, they provide the tightest possible seal to keep out the elements. The door jamb is usually held in place with nails, screws, and caulk. The screws shouldn't be difficult to remove, though the caulk can sometimes be a challenge to strip out. Certain silicone-based caulks or sealants can be loosed with specialized chemical applications available at many hardware stores. Exterior molding may come off only with great difficulty; there is usually no special trick to it, just the application of leverage via a pry bar. Pry off interior trim carefully, so as not to damage the surrounding wall paint or paper. Along with a pry bar, it may be helpful to use a putty knife to get between the trim and wall with minimal damage.; , Use a level to measure the sill (bottom), sides, and top of the frame. If it is not as it should be, you may need to add wood around the frame to make it level.The most common cause of difficulties is the sill. If it is exposed to weather, it is the most likely portion to be warped or rotted. In this case, remove the existing materials and replace them with like-sized boards.  You must measure the height, width, and depth in order to know the precise size you must have for the door you will purchase.   Do not underestimate the importance of measuring the depth. If the distance between the interior and exterior walls is great but the depth of door jamb on the new door you purchase is small, you will have to add jamb extensions. This shouldn't be too much of a problem unless the distance you have to make up is especially large, but it is something to be aware of.  Aside from the pre-hung door, there are a few other things you will need:   Wooden shims to hold the new door in place as you attach it to the frame. Screws or nails to secure the door in place. Make sure the nails or screws you select are of an appropriate length for the jamb and frame you will be nailing through. An electric drill set to pre-drill any holes and drive in the screws that will attach the door. Caulk or other form of exterior sealant to prevent leaks around the edges of the jamb. A drip cap and sill pan (optional), to protect the upper and lower portions of any doorway that be exposed directly to the elements.  After you have the door in place you will no longer have access to these areas. In particular, look for any remaining uneven spots that can be filled in to prevent air leaks or the collection of water. Especially focus on the sill area. The caulk will dry slowly, so it should still be pliable when you fit the new door into place., It is usually easiest to move the bottom of the door to the doorway and then raise the whole door unit into the frame.   Push shims into the spaces along the sides and top of the jamb to make the door fit snugly in place. You may only be able to do this from the interior side of the house as many exterior doors have molding around the exterior side of the jamb that will limit access to any gap.Check to make sure the door is level before you nail or screw the door into its final position.  Nail or screw through the jamb into the frame at several points to ensure that it is held firmly in place.   Most pre-hung doors will also come with a few long screws that are specifically designed to anchor the door itself into the frame. Remove a few of the short screws that attach the door to the jamb and replace these with the long screws.  The sill pan will just screw or nail into place over the sill region, and the cap will have to be attached where the exterior molding meets the outside wall.  You must cover any remaining gaps to prevent air leaks or water damage.	Remove the old door and the surrounding trim, molding, and door jamb. Determine if the doorway is level. Measure the doorway. Purchase the necessary materials and tools. Pre-caulk the hard to reach areas inside the frame of the door. Set the door in place. Secure the door into the frame. Install the sill pan and drip cap. Caulk around the edges to make sure the seal it complete.
Even if you don’t feel like your space is overly messy, take time to intentionally de-clutter. You might be surprised by how much you have accumulated. Eliminating excess is an essential component of making your space feel peaceful.   Look to the cultural phenomenon, Marie Kondo, for her famous de-cluttering practices. Ask yourself what items in your bedroom truly give you joy.Put these items in a definitely keep pile. Make other piles to donate, to recycle, and to throw away. Make an immediate trip to the donation center so that you don’t put it off. If there are any items you’re unsure about giving up, box them up, date the box, and put them away in a closet. If you don’t reach for any of them within six months, give the box away without even opening it. Include furniture. Does your furniture add to the space? If not, do you need it, and if so, do you have funds to find something else?; , After you’ve de-cluttered, this is a guaranteed way to make your space feel fresh.   Get to all the tasks you don’t think about in your normal cleaning routine.Dust your baseboards, molding, and ceiling fans, and clean the glass of mirrors and windows. If you have curtains, take them down and wash them. Sweep and mop hardwood floors, and thoroughly vacuum carpet. Make sure to also clean under your bed. If you have furniture against your walls, move it a few inches so you can clean behind it. Use a magic eraser, like Mr. Clean’s, to get any scuff marks off your walls.  If you compare effect to price, painting your room is an inexpensive way to make a drastic update to your space. Stick to more neutral colors that you won’t grow to dislike over time.   Shades of white work well in any space. White paint will make your room feel brighter and more open. It’s a calming color and good backdrop to make decorations pop. If you want a little more drama in your space, try painting your walls a velvety black or navy blue.A darker room done right can feel cozy and timeless. Be wary of these colors, however, if your space already feels a little cramped. If you don’t want to paint your entire room, paint an accent wall on the wall behind your bed.If you like your current paint color, just do a few touch ups with a paint brush.  Whether you’re planning a complete makeover or just a small refresh, it can help to create your vision for the space. This will keep your process and outcome cohesive.   Choose a color scheme. Pick a neutral base and a few coordinating accent colors for decorations like coral, teal, and mustard yellow. When you are choosing items to bring to your room, refer back to see if they loosely fit this scheme. Think about how you want your space to feel. Do you want it to be minimalist, crisp, and bright, or cozily full of sweet, quirky items and various patterns? Do you want wood in your room or accents of metal? As you begin to update your space, think about whether the changes fit into your vision for the space.  Just the small change of moving your bed can make you feel like you have a brand new room. Your bed should be the focal point of this space.Try to move your bed against a different wall, and reorganize your other furniture based on the placement of your bed. You don’t have to place your bed against the wall. Consider putting your bed a diagonal or leaving it to float free in your space.  Or, if you don’t already have a headboard, add one. This is a way to give plain furniture a little bit of style.   Your headboard doesn’t have to be a standard frame or hard headboard because it isn’t structurally important to your bed. Consider hanging a piece of art: an oversized poster or a woven tapestry work well.You can even hang a woven rug on your wall as a tapestry. If you have a plush headboard, recover it. New fabric will give an instant face lift to your bed. Use a corkboard or pegboard. You can paint it the color of your choice and constantly change the pictures and mementos you hang from it. Paint a mural above your bed or adorn it with wall decals.This will give you a more intricate image than you’d get with a traditional headboard.  The lighting in your bedroom creates ambience and mood. Consider adding new lighting for more sources of soft light. The more sources of lower wattage light you have in a room, the better.If you are able, install dimmers on your lights, so you can change the brightness of your lights. Keep practicality in mind. You’ll need a lamp by your bedside, and you might want a stylish nightlight near your bathroom.  Certain types of light can add decor even while off. Consider stringing up a few strands of decorative fairy lights. Depending on the style of your space, you can find different shapes and themes in these string lights.   Pretty candles, whether they are real or artificial, can add a soft, relaxing glow to your space at night. You can even keep an entire shelf of varying sizes of candles.  This is a simple way to make your doors and furniture seem new.   Depending on your vision, choose sleek and metal minimalistic hardware or bright focal points like crystal door knobs and painted ceramic hardware. You can even get creative and make your own hardware.You can use anything from ribbon to yardsticks or old cutlery.  As you redecorate, don’t feel like you need to buy new pieces of artwork all at once. Fill your space slowly with things you love.   If you want a clean look to your walls, get your art and pictures framed and hang them equally spaced apart.For a more organic look, hang unframed artwork with pretty pins or washi tape tacked in the corners.  A new duvet or quilt can make a huge difference in the way you feel about relaxing in your bedroom.   Think about getting a fluffy white comfortable and white pillowcases. The white looks bright, soft, and inviting. If it gets dirty, you can simply bleach it back to its original bright white. If you don’t want white, choose a pattern you love. Feel free to mix a patterned quilt with different patterned pillows for a more textural look. Get new sheets. This is a small luxury that can make you more comfortable. Opt for 100% cotton or linen sheets, which will only get softer with time and will last for years.  Even if you already have carpet in your room, an area rug can add an element of comfort, style, and fun.Choose a bright patterned rug if the rest of your space is fairly minimal. This is a great way to add art and whimsy without cluttering your walls. Add a soft, shag rug. These are great to put around your bed so that your feet will sink into them each morning as you get up.  Plants not only make a space prettier, they also purifier the air and make you calmer.   When picking plants for your space, make sure to take into account the amount of sunlight your room gets.For lower maintenance plants, choose succulents and cacti. Use large baskets and beautiful ceramic pots as decorative holders for your plants.  Even though you can’t see it, scent plays a part in the decorative feel of your room. Using aromatherapy can help you create your ideal relaxing environment.Invest in candles, incense, or an essential oil diffuser for your bedside. Scents like lavender, jasmine, and rosemary are calming and clarifying.	De-clutter your bedroom. Give your room a deep clean. Consider painting. Make a mood board for your bedroom. Reposition your bed. Change your headboard. Rethink your functional lighting. Add decorative lighting. Change out hardware on doors and furniture. Hang pictures and artwork that mean something to you. Update your bedspread and pillows. Consider an area rug. Add life to your space. Add scent.
The takeoff ramp needs to be curved up to a steep lip about 45-75 degrees at the top, or else you overshoot and crash.  Remember that when you compact the dirt mounds, they get smaller. One good way not to push the wheelbarrow all the time is to put one and half times what you desire to have as the height of the jump (for example, a beginner that wants a jump 3 feet high actually needs 4.5 feet of dirt because of the loss from compaction) so you won't waste time shoveling again and pushing that wheelbarrow every time you need a little dirt. Make the lip of the jump flat so you can get as much air as possible.       ; , Another good idea is to use a roller this will help compact your jump and make them smoother and better. If the spaded shovel doesn't help just get a compacter and pack it down.  In addition, it makes the dirt more malleable.  Make them progressively bigger. Add berms and rollers to maintain and gather speed.  If in a tight area, just land & slow down, turn around, and do it again.	Mound rocks and logs in two piles and add dirt on top of it about as high as your skill level (2-3 feet for beginners and 5-9 feet for experts, the gap (if you feel like you are certain to crash, do a jump instead) needs to be 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) for beginners and 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) for experts). Compact the ramps down by hitting them with a flat spade or stamping on them. Add water to the dirt jump so it doesn't become dusty and break apart in clumps, and so it's easier to pack down. Make multiple jumps in a row, also known as a rhythm section. Focus on a set up that flows.
Boysenberries enjoy mild winters and warm summers.; , Add a lot of well-rotted manure to the ground before planting.  The best method for growing boysenberries is to place a two-wire trellis system in the planting area. Erect this prior to planting.   Tie the fruiting canes to the top wire of the two-wire trellis. Use the second wire to train new growth that will fruit in the following year. , The main difference is that boysenberries require a lot more vigorous pruning to prevent their growth from getting out of hand.  A well tended boysenberry plant should produce fruit well for up to 15 years. Expect about 5kg of fruit each season from each plant.   Cut back the top growing canes (the ones attached to the top wire) at the end of the harvest. Cut them down to ground level. In turn, transfer the new growth canes to the top wire level in readiness for next season.  Boysenberries can be made into ice cream, baked in cakes, pies, and crumbles, or enjoyed fresh on their own or with a dollop of cream or ice cream.	Ensure that you have a suitable climate. Prepare the soil. Prepare a trellis system. Space boysenberry plants 2 meters (6.6 ft) apart.  , Use the same methods for growing boysenberries as for growing raspberries. Harvest the boysenberries when ready. Enjoy the harvest.
To generalize trance or house as "techno" is like generalizing death metal as "rock". Be willing to listen to new music and search "What is electronic music?" In the broadest sense, any music incorporating electronic elements ("instruments", samples, synthesis, effects) can be considered electronic. Most popular music today could meet this definition.; , Electronic music commonly uses drum machines, samples (sound clips), and/or synthesizers and effects processors.  Tempo (song speed) is often measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM), and electronic music songs may vary widely in BPM.	Don't use the word "techno" as a catch-all term for all electronic music. Understand electronic music composition. Understand that not all electronic music is fast or meant for dancing.
Depending on your reasons for making the video, you may want to invest in a high-quality camera to create a professional-looking project, or you may want to use whatever is available for a cheaper option. Whatever the case, getting a camera to shoot video on should be your first step.    Cellphone videos are super-cheap and really easy to use. They can be a little shaky, however, and the sound is usually not very good, but if you want to grab some video quickly and easily, the camera on your cell is a good option.  Digital photo cameras regularly have video features, and some are quite cheap and fairly high-quality. Cameras with SD cards are widely available and user-friendly.  HD Cameras can run anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars and will look very professional. Many low-budget Hollywood movies have been shot on basic HD cameras you can buy at electronics stores like Best Buy, or even explore renting options in your area.; , Whether you're shooting a birthday party, concert, a wedding, or some other event, get to the place early and do some scouting to see the right angles for shooting video. Find a few comfortable positions and shoot from multiple angles to get different footage that you'll be able to edit together later into a nice product.   If you've got a helper, you can shoot simultaneously from different angles to provide cuts in your finished product with editing. This can be a cool effect that will make your finished product seem finished and professional. Try to stay out of peoples' way, especially if there's a sizable crowd. You want to get the close shot and the right angle, but you're not the only one there. Make sure everyone can see and shoot from a reasonable distance., To be ready for spontaneous moments, keep the camera going! Pick the right time to start and let the camera warm up, so the video begins before the actual action you want to capture. If you Try to fire up the camera when you see your kid sprinting toward the goal, ready to take a shot in the championship soccer game, it's likely you'll miss it. If you've been filming since half-time, though, you'll be ready.   Don't try to edit together your video on the fly. It's better to avoid lots of stops and starts to the video, because you'll have trouble remember what shot happened when, which will be much easier to sort out if you've got longer shots. You can edit out the unnecessary bits later, but most cameras have lots of room on them, so take advantage of it.  If you're using the camera on your cellphone, or any camera that isn't steadied with a tripod, Try to hold it as steady as possible. Shakiness and blurriness from an unsteady hand can make important video footage frustrating and unwatchable. Sit down while shooting and steady your arms on your knees, if necessary, or invest in a tripod that'll keep the camera steady on the ground.   A common mistake on iPhone cameras involves holding the phone vertically while taking video, as opposed to horizontally. When you upload the video to your computer later to edit it (if you want to) you'll have annoying bars on either side of the screen. Shoot the "landscape" style and hold the camera long-ways. It'll show up sideways on your phone, but you can tilt it later on your computer and it'll look right.  If you're just using the built-in mic on your camera and not trying to capture sound with other microphones, you'll have a lot of trouble hearing the action unless you're quite close.	Get a camera. Find the best angles. Keep rolling. Stay as steady as possible. Get as close as possible if you want to capture sound.
You do not need to own a Mother-of-Thousands plant, but you need access to one with plantlets.; , As Mother-of-Thousands grows, small plantlets, similar to buds, grow along the ridges of plant leaves. Take more than one, because the plantlets can easily die. Do not worry about harming the plant itself by taking the plantlets. They all fall off anyway, and the Mother-of-Thousands will have more energy to grow when it does not have to support the plantlets anymore.  Keep them in the bag until you can transplant the plantlets. Don't let them dry up, or they will die.  It does not need to be deep. The roots will not be very deep at first, so a large bowl is not necessary.  They do not need to be pushed into the soil. Mother-of-Thousands naturally propagates by dropping its plantlets.  This will help keep moisture in, as well as working as a makeshift greenhouse.  Windowsills work wonders, but remember that the more sun the plantlets get, the more attention you will need to give them.  Mother-of-Thousands is a succulent, which means it does not need much water. It does need moisture to stimulate the growth of roots, though.  Stimulated by the moisture and the soil, the plant grows roots via mitosis of meristematic-type tissue in notches in the leaves. You may start to see small, thin, white roots sprout from the base of the plantlets. Make sure you keep an eye on the moisture and height of the plantlets.  They are now ready to stretch for the sun!  , You can test the plant lets by gently lifting them. Be careful when doing this; you can damage the small roots if are too rough. , Unfortunately, some species of Mother-of-Thousands, and their lookalikes can die after blooming small purple-pink flowers late in life. Not all plants will develop these flowers, it happens very sporadically if at all. Their life-span can be extended in preparation for the appearance of flowers by simply watering it less once it grows to about 1 foot (0.3 m) to 1.5 feet (0.5 m). Be careful not to let it get dehydrated, there is a fine line between too much and too little water. If it does look like its life is about to end, simply take a couple of its plantlets and grow a new plant or two.	Find a friend or garden with a Mother-of-Thousands plant. Pick some plantlets. Store the plantlets in a plastic bag. Fill a shallow bowl with potting soil. Place the plantlets gently on the surface of the soil, approximately three quarters of an inch (2 centimeters) to one inch (2.5 centimeters) apart. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Take the plantlets to a sunny place. Keep the soil moist, not wet. Wait, monitor and observe. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl when the plants are too tall for it. Replant to more appropriate pots or bowls when the plantlets have grown significant roots. Enjoy your newly-propagated Mother-of-Thousands!  , Prepare for the plant to die after it flowers.
Using vinegar, baking soda, and water is an effective, eco-friendly method of unclogging your pipes. The baking soda and hot water will loosen up any build-up that’s clogging your waste pipe, and the chemical reaction from the vinegar will cause the sludge to move on down the drain.   Start by pouring a pot of boiling water down your drain. After you do this, pour 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain and let it sit for 5 minutes. Follow this with a solution of 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup very hot water. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Pour one more pot of boiling water down the drain to flush away the scum that has been loosened up by the baking soda and vinegar.; , One of the most common ways to clean out your waste pipes is to purchase liquid drain cleaner at your local convenience store. These chemical solutions are often very effective, but can sometimes cause damage to pipes if they are old or worn down.   Popular liquid drain cleaners include Drano, Liquid Plumr, and Rid-X. The instructions for these products will be included on the bottle, but you will typically use an entire bottle to unclog stopped up pipes. The chemical solution will need to sit in place for awhile, but be sure to rinse it out with hot water before taking a bath or shower.  Some people prefer to use powder based cleaners as opposed to liquid ones, as they are less corrosive on the pipes. Most of these powders contain the chemical Sodium Hydroxide, which works quickly to unclog drains. Because it works quickly, the product doesn't need to sit in the clogged drain for long periods of time to be effective.   Popular powder cleaners are Thrift and Drain Care. When using these products, let hot water run through the pipes for 1-2 minutes before pouring the powder down the drain. Use roughly 2 cups of powder (more or less depending on the size of the drain), and let the powder sit for 2 minutes before rinsing with hot water., Chemical substances work by dissolving the scum, hair, and dirt that tends to clog drains and waste pipes. Because of this, these chemical products are usually extremely corrosive and may be harmful on older pipes. Take extreme caution when handling these products, as they can sometimes cause injury to your skin.   To be extra cautious, only handle these products while wearing rubber gloves.	Make your own unclogging mixture out of household supplies. Purchase liquid cleaners to unclog your pipes. Use a powder solution to clean your waste pipes. Be careful when using chemical substances.
There is a long-standing myth in the music industry that the old-fashioned fix of recording a song, placing it in an envelope and mailing it to oneself guaranteed copyright. The post date on the stamp was supposed to serve as proof of the date of origin of the song, provided the envelope remained sealed. However, this method didn't stand up in various court cases and has since been discredited.Moreover, given that your copyright exists on creation, and that an envelope's seal can be carefully unsealed and resealed, this method does seem rather fallible.  If your country is a member of the Berne Convention, copyright in a song comes into existence when you create it. It does become more complicated when there are several creators who have contributed to the song, but there are rules governing these "layers." It's best to seek legal advice in that situation.   The U.S. copyright office is the only one among the Berne Convention's member countries offering a method to register content of the song (lyrics, melody, chord, etc). Unfortunately in all other countries, only the title of the song is recorded. The value of the protection afforded is significantly reduced.	Avoid poor man's copyright. Be aware of the Berne Convention.
Instead of going on a walk, go on a wander. Instead of walking somewhere you go all the time, walk on streets you don't know well. Take public transportation to a park, lake, or other natural space you haven't visited. Take your cell phone, take a friend with ou if you want, and let your family know that you are wandering.   Take a map and draw a wiggly path on it without looking. Challenge yourself to walk along the path you drew as closely as you can. Make sure it loops you back home!  , Is there a downtown or shopping center where you live? Go to stores you have never entered. Challenge yourself to find something you like in each place. You don't have to buy anything, but try to get a sense of what you would buy if you were someone who shopped there. Each store is selling an image, so explore the ways those images can fit you or not.   For instance, you could visit an vintage store and explore dated fashion and obsolete technology. Imagine what it was like to wear a corset, wear a hat every day, or "dial" a phone.  Ask a friend to go on a picnic with you, and pack a bag or a basket of treats, a picnic blanket, and maybe a good book or two. You can pack the whole picnic yourself, or ask your friend to bring one or two things (a beverage, a fruit) while you bring the rest.   Visit a farmer's market or a grocery store together and pick out 3-6 things together. You might get fresh bread, apples, cheese, chocolate, carrots, and hummus, for example. Take your picnic somewhere green and quiet, or somewhere with a good view. Go on a hike if you can. Eat the picnic at the top of the mountain or end of the trail. Make sure to pack water!	Go on a wander. Visit strange shops. Pack a picnic.
Your dealer will be able to inform you about the types of alarm systems that come standard on specific trucks. If you want to purchase an after-market alarm system, you should not hesitate because of extraneous issues, such as a fear of violating a manufacturer's warranty. Due to federal law, it is not legal to void a warranty due to the installation of an alarm system unless the manufacturer supplies the truck with an alarm for free.; , One of the best ways to get information on alarms is directly from the police. They deal with auto theft on a daily basis and can inform you of why certain alarms work for frequently than others.  There are several different types of alarms that work in their own unique ways. Independent alarms simply sound off a siren or horn when breached, while other more complex alarms interact with police to a great extent, even going so far as to give authorities GPS locations of the stolen vehicle.  Radar Sensors can create a field around your truck, detecting any movement around the entire vehicle and sound an alarm in the event of any unwarranted activities. Audio Sensor alarms detect specific frequencies of breaking glass and sound a horn or alarm when detected, which saves valuable items inside your truck in the event of a smash and grab.  Many alarm systems will have reviews on the internet. Make note of which companies have the most positive reviews, and which models of alarms have received the most praise.  This is a crucial aspect of owning an alarm. Do not install the alarm yourself unless you are a qualified professional with extensive experience working with alarms and the electrical system of your truck. If installed incorrectly, your alarm could malfunction, either sounding off when there is no present danger, or worse, failing to sound when needed.  Just as automotive insurance companies offer rate reductions for defensive driving courses, many offer reductions for the addition of an aftermarket alarm.	Discuss alarm installation with your dealership. Talk to law enforcement professionals. Decide which features are right for you. Consider external alarms. Research alarm companies. Purchase your alarm and have it installed professionally. Contact insurance company for possible rate reductions.
The cause will usually be either a badly out of balance load, or a poorly leveled and set up machine.   Balance the load of clothes by opening the lid, and looking to see if there is a lot more on one side of the agitator than the other, and if this is the problem, move them around, close the lid, restart the spin cycle, and observe the results. You may try repositioning the clothes in the tub slightly more if you original efforts helped significantly. If the machine is brand new and already started behaving this way from its first use, then it is possible that the shipping bolts were not removed from the back of the machine before first use. This would cause violent vibration during the spin cycle. You can check if this is the case easily by opening the door on a front-loader washing machine and pushing down on the drum. If the shipping bolts are still fixed to the machine, then the drum will not move vertically at all. If they have been removed by the person that installed it, as they should have been, then the drum should sink slightly under the pressure of your hand and then spring back up when released.; , If it wobbles when you do, the adjustment screws on the machine's base may not be set correctly, or on older machines, the threads may be stripped or corroded out, causing them to fail.  This is done by kneeling down in front of the machine, and rocking it to see which corner seems to be floating, or not in contact with the floor. The leveling screw should be screwed out (clockwise, if viewed from above), which lengthens it, or the adjacent side should be screwed in (shortened), so that each leveler is in contact with the floor. ,, Shims can be made of almost any resilient, non-degradable material which can be cut easily, like scrap vinyl composition tile, rubber matting, or even plastic margarine container lids. ,	Find out the reason for the shaking during the spin cycle. Try to tip or tilt the machine. Re-level your machine and ensure it is supported correctly. Use a pair of pliers if the thumbscrews are too tight to turn with your fingers, and spraying the screws with a lubricant may help, also.  , Restart your machine when you have made sure all the leveling screws are in contact with the floor.  , Use shims to support the machine if the screws have become unusable for some reason (broken, stripped, or otherwise damaged). Cut a number of shims, about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) in width, and stack them under each corner where they are needed, until the corners are equally supported.  , Restart the machine and observe your results.
If making garments is your specialty, sew a few sample dresses or other garments to show to potential buyers. Let buyers know that the items are only samples and offer to sew garments based on the buyer's measurements.       Sew handbags or other accessories. Purses and bags are popular items at craft fairs and online shops, so think of a way to put your sewing skills to use to come up with a design that sets your bags apart.       For example, you might want to sew bags with LED lights sewn into the front. Another idea would be to make a purse that can fold up to fit in a pocket when not in use.; ,   You don't want to start an online shop or attend a craft fair and have only 1 or 2 items for sale. Make at least 20 hand-sewn items before you put your shop up online or register for craft fairs. Don't go overboard purchasing materials. You don't want to end up with massive amounts of unsold inventory if your home sewing business doesn't take off.    Before applying to any craft fair, look at the style of the fair and the type of items that vendors sell to determine whether your items will be a good fit. For example, if you sew traditional items, you may not fit in at a more trendy or contemporary craft fair. Some craft fairs want a wide range of items and may not accept you if you sew items that are common, such as purses or skirts. Scout out the craft fair while you're there to meet other artists and to see what other crafters are doing. Bring along a friend to watch your table while you walk around the craft fair.   The cost of traveling to craft fairs can add up. You'll also have to pay for the table or booth, as well as materials to display your hand-sewn items.    Register for an account at an online handmade listing site. You can do this in place of selling at craft fairs to make your sewing business truly a home business. List your items on the site and set prices for them. Set your prices so that you'll actually make money. Don't be shy about pricing items high. You've put a lot of work into sewing them, and you should make money beyond reimbursing yourself for materials.    Print fliers advertising your lessons and hang them at local fabric and craft stores. Advertise your lessons on a free online classified website.	Decide what items you will sew and sell. Create enough hand-sewn items to display to customers at craft fairs and online. Register and apply to sell items at craft fairs to make money. Stay local to start. Set up an online shop. Teach sewing lessons to children and adults to make money at home.
Make sure they think you're ready enough so that you don't crash and burn in front of 50+ people.; , There are many, many feisanna in the spring.  Usually these will be available somewhere in your dance studio. Make sure you have a copy of the official form, because some feisanna require that you submit an actual entry form and ignore index cards or paper. Better safe than sorry. On the flip side, some feisanna will ask that you use an index card. It will probably say, "Entries to be submitted on a 3x5 card." This means a standard index card. The information sheet will then give you a list of things to write down (i.e. 1. Name, 2. Age, and so on). Always number the card 1 through 10 and write each tidbit of information down next to the number designated on the form.   If you read about the feis online, there will usually be a link that takes you to the syllabus and entry form. Some schools will mail you your number if you enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope big enough for however big of a card they say. This is optional, because all feiseanna will give you your number when you get there if you don't have it already. Sometimes schools will post the list of competitors and their numbers, schools, levels, etc. on their website once they have received all the entries. If such is the case, you can look, but don't write your number on your own index card, because the card they give you will also have other important information on it. This is, however, a great resource to use to see how many people you'll be up against. You can also check to see if your friends will be there. ,,, The syllabus is the sheet that says which category you belong in, what songs you dance to, and what dances you do.  if you have never competed before, you most likely fall into Beginner. Check with your teacher to be sure. For experienced competitors, check the syllabus and it will say where you belong. Read carefully above each table where it lists the category name, and then it should say, "For dancers who have won__________in________category or something similar.  This is whatever age you are under, or going to be. For example, if it's February, you're 11 years old and you turn 12 in the summer, and your feis is in April, you would list yourself as Beginner, U12.  Beginners typically do a reel and a light jig, and a slip jig is also a choice if they feel they're ready. Check with your teacher to see if s/he thinks you're ready for a slip jig. Find your U under your category (in the table on the left hand column it should say, "U12" and then three numbers). For a reel, light jig and slip jig, the numbers are usually in the 120's. Fill them in. So in the lines it might say, "Beginner U12, 121, 122, 123."  ,, This should be the head director of your school. The names of student or assistant teachers are NOT appropriate in this field and may be disregarded.  Most feisanna charge something like $8 per dance. For example, $8 times three dances = $24.  This is a fee for any parties who want to watch you dance. If you are dancing with no one in the audience with you (sometimes you're better off that way, because family only agitates you at a feis) you have no gate fee to pay. Instead of a gate fee, however, many feiseanna now ask that everyone pays a "basic fee," which is only once per family.  This is your total fee.  On the school's website, they will post lots of important information, so check for things like your competition number and which stage and time you're dancing on (there are like 4). It will include information about the venue (not driving directions though!), local restaurants and lodging and anything else they feel you should know about where you'll be dancing. Some studios mail out the competitor numbers to the school you dance at, and you find the index card with your name on the back. On the front is your number.	Get your teacher's approval. Find a feis you want to compete in. Find the entry form. Fill out general information, such as your name, street address, phone number and e-mail address, and anything else it may ask you for.  , Fill in your age as of January 1st of the current year.  , Fill in your date of birth, and the age you currently are.  , Find the syllabus (SILL-a-bus), and fill the rest in with it handy. Fill in your category. Fill in your U, which is right after your category name. Decide what dances you will do. Write down your school name.  , Write down your teacher's name. Figure out how much you owe. Include the gate fee. Add these two fees together. Mail this form to the organization or Irish dance school holding the feis. Make sure you know where you're going.
Putty sealers typically get molded around the base of the mold to seal the hole. They’re usually pressed into a disk and stuck to the bottom of the mold. Removing this kind of sealer is as simple as peeling it off, much like sticky tack., Magnetic mold sealers are simple metal sheets that are magnetically charged. They snap onto the bottom of a mold to prevent wax from leaking out. Removing these is as simple as pulling them off.  If you’re using plastic or aluminium molds, you’re likely not using a magnetic mold sealer., Rubber mold plugs are shaped somewhat like a spinning top; they have a large base and a tapered tip. Usually they just squeeze into the hole at the bottom of a candle mold. That means removing them is as simple as grabbing the base and pulling them out.  With rubber molds, the wick may be wrapped around a wick bar at the bottom of the mold. If so, you’ll need to unwrap the wick before you can remove the candle., If you try to remove the candle before the wax has set completely, the surface of the candle might tear and crumble. Leave the mold on a flat surface that won’t be damaged while the mold is still warm. It may take some time for the mold to cool; be patient., Flip the mold upside down, so the opening faces downwards. Use your fingers to lightly tap on the bottom of the mold, which will shake the candle loose. Tap slowly and progressively, or the candle might slip out too quickly.  Don’t bang the mold against a counter or other hard surface, since this could damage the candle., If tapping on the mold isn’t enough to dislodge the candle, you can gently tug on the couple of inches of wick poking out the top of the candle. Don’t use too much strength when pulling on the wick; you might break the string or cause it to slip out of the candle., Placing the mold in the refrigerator will speed up the cooling process, helping the wax set and separate from the mold. Flip the mold every 30 minutes; this will make sure the mold and wax cool evenly. Check the mold periodically; you’ll want to remove it from the fridge as soon as it’s cold to the touch.  Make sure you wait until the mold has cooled to room temperature before placing it in the fridge. If the temperature change is too drastic, the candle could crack., If the candle’s especially difficult to dislodge, you can try putting the mold in the freezer. Take it out after five minutes and try to remove the candle. If it still won’t budge, leave it in the freezer for an additional five minutes. You don’t want to leave the mold in any longer than 10 minutes, since this will definitely cause the candle to crack., Finally, if you’ve tried all of the above and can’t remove the candle, you might have to cut your losses. Place the mold in a metal dish filled with boiling water and wait for the candle to soften. After a few minutes, you should be able to retrieve the candle; use a pair of tongs or a wooden spoon to avoid burning yourself.  This process won’t save your candle, but you can at least melt down the wax for use in your next attempt.	Peel off putty type sealers. Snap off magnetic mold sealers. Pull out rubber mold plugs. Wait until the mold cools completely. Tap on the bottom of the mold. Tug the wick lightly. Refrigerate the mold. Put the mold in the freezer for five minutes. Use boiling water to remove completely stuck candles.
Get an 18-inch (45.72-centimeter) long sheet of felt. Fold it in half so that it is 14 inches (35.56 centimeters) long. This method is for a wine bag, but you can use it to make another type of bag as well. Simply change the dimensions to suit your gift.How wide the felt is depends on how many bags you want to make. The wider the felt, the more bags you'll be able to make.  Keep the narrower edge on the fold. If you'd like to, you can cut it out using pinking sheers for an interesting effect.You can also round the top corners instead., Unfold your felt strip. Measure down about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) from one of the narrow edges. Make two vertical slits in the middle, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) apart, and ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) tall.The slits need to be the same height as your ribbon. If the ribbon you will be using is a different height, adjust the height of the slits accordingly.  Start applying the glue about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the bottom. This will create the base of the bag.Apply the glue no more than 1/4 inch (.64 centimeters) from the edges., Choose a ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide ribbon that matches your bag. Slide the ribbon under the back tab. Wrap it around to the front. Insert your gift, then tie the ends of the ribbon into a bow.For a nicer touch, cut the ends of the ribbon at an angle.	Fold a sheet of felt fabric in half. Cut a 6 by 18-inch (15.24 by 45.72-centimeter) rectangle out of the felt. Cut two slits into the back of the bag for the ribbon closure. Hot glue the long edges of the bag together. Add a ribbon.
You might have a passion for stage acting or a desire to work strictly in television or film. Comedy might be your area of strength or you might excel in dramatic expression.; ,   Enroll in a theater program. New York has many reputable drama schools that offer high-quality training for actors. Some are undergraduate programs requiring study of general education courses in addition to theater classes. Other programs are strictly theater schools, focusing on the art of acting. Find a drama coach. If you prefer one-on-one or small group instruction, study with a drama coach. Choose a coach who has trained and guided other actresses through successful acting careers.  An acting resume is typically 1 page in length and lists your acting qualifications.   Provide your name and contact information at the top. Your full name, phone number, address and email address are required information. Include a physical description. Acting resumes require your height, weight, eye color and hair color. This information is necessary for directors who must fill specific roles. Indicate your acting training. If you have a degree in theater or have taken classes with specific instructors, include that information. If you have studied with a reputable theater school or acting coach, mentioning the name might attract positive attention. List your acting experience. This is typically several columns of information with headings like "Production Name," "Role" and "Date." Provide a website URL. If you have an actor's website, include the Web address so that directors and casting agents can view pictures or clips of your past work.  This is a professionally produced 8-inch by 10-inch (20.3-cm by 25.4-cm) image taken from the neck up.  New York City has many acting agencies with close connections to directors and production houses. Research various agencies to select one that has contacts in your preferred acting genre. Agents usually require a resume, headshot and clips of past work.  A high-quality agent will send you notices of auditions for acting jobs that are a promising fit. Auditions also can be found in acting trade magazines, online acting resources and job search sites.   Prepare for the audition. Familiarize yourself with dress requirements and what to expect by asking your agent or reading the details of the audition posting. Rehearse your lines. Always show up prepared for the audition. The more prepared you are, the greater the chances of feeling relaxed and performing your best. Bring music, if necessary. If auditioning for a musical, you might be asked to sing a song. Be prepared with recorded music or sheet music, if an on-site musician will be provided.  The Taft-Hartley Act, named after its original sponsors, is the acting industry's informal term for labor union requirements. You earn Taft-Hartley status by speaking a line in a film or television show.

To use Pandora, you can listen without an account, but it won't store any of your music the next time you visit it, so it's helpful to create an account so you can save stations.   With Pandora you can also choose between a free account and a paid account. The paid account essentially allows you to listen to music without commercials or advertisements.  One way to discover new music on Pandora is by creating new stations and liking or disliking certain songs as they play. You can create a station based on an artist or track, and then Pandora will play music similar to that artist or track.  As you listen to music, the best way to discover new music is by personalizing your station. When a song comes on that you like, click the "thumbs-up" icon at the top of the screen and when you dislike a song click the "thumbs-down" icon. This will help Pandora play songs that are more suited to your taste.   Each time a new song plays, Pandora will also show similar artists to that song. As you are listening to music, you may discover some new artists or songs by clicking on one of those similar artists. After you have listened to a station you can also go back to that station and edit the artists and tracks you have liked or disliked. On the left side of the screen where your stations are displayed, you can click on the "Options" button underneath a station. Then click on "Station Details," and you'll be brought to a page that shows your thumbed-up and thumbed-down tracks. If you are tired of certain songs or want more variety you can delete some of those tracks so that the variety of music played on that station will be broader.  In Pandora you can also browse playlists and genres that Pandora has already created. In the top left corner, click in the search bar. A white box that gives you instructions should come up as well as a link within that box that says "Browse Genres." Click on that link to view the different genres and stations.   Pandora has a number of stations within each genre, suited for the type of music you are interested in or the mood your are feeling. You can view their top stations, for music that is popular, or you can visit their other categories that consist of a number of genres with different stations within the genres. There are certain categories that aren't necessarily a genre like "Classical," but are more of a mood, like "Dinner/Cooking," "Studying," and "Workout." Within these categories you have different stations that Pandora has created. For example, within "Dinner/Cooking" there are different stations like "Hipster Cocktail Party," "Laid Back Brunch," Funny Feast Comedy," all with songs that are suited for that type of meal.	Create an account. Create new stations based on an artist or song. Personalize your station. Browse genres.
A typical dining room has fewer pieces of decor because the surfaces of the furniture need to remain empty for meals. The walls offer the best opportunity for adding a splash of style with photographs, paintings, prints, or shelves.Look for pieces that fit the style you chose for the space. Consider how the pieces will look together.  A large mirror can reflect the light in the room, making the room feel brighter. Look for a mirror that has a frame that fits the style you want. You can even find a dramatic frame that turns the mirror into a focal point in the room., Choosing a wall cover can change the whole look of the room. Consider painting it a fun color, or apply a wallpaper. You can decide to do the whole room, or you can limit the print to one wall.   Get samples of paint colors and wallpapers to see how they look in your room before you invest in your choice.  Make one wall a focal point by setting it apart from the rest. You can use a special paint color or wallpaper, or you can use groupings of paintings or prints. Arrange items according to a central theme.   If you collect items, consider grouping your collections on shelves to create an accent wall.	Choose art that expresses your style. Try a large mirror. Add color or a wallpaper print. Create an accent or gallery wall.
The vegetables should be arranged loosely in a single layer and should not overlap.  Wait until the vegetables are firm before removing the tray.  You must leave an appropriate amount of empty space to allow the food a chance to expand as it freezes. Otherwise, you risk breaking the container.   For container freezing, leave a 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) space between the top of the top of the vegetables and the rim of the container. When freezing in a plastic bag, leave a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) space between the top of the vegetables and the top of the bag. Seal the bag and tie it shut with a rubber band placed 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) above the top of the food. Some garden vegetables, like green beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, onions, peas, peppers, and turnips, do not need to be tray frozen before being packed. For these vegetables, tightly pack the blanched, drained vegetables into containers and follow the same guidelines regarding empty space.  Write down the contents of the package and the date the food was first frozen.  For best results, only pack 2 to 3 pounds (900 to 1350 grams) of vegetables for each cubic foot. If the vegetables are packed any tighter than that, they may take too long to freeze.  The majority of garden vegetables will retain their freshness, taste, and nutritional value for a year or longer if kept at this temperature.	Lay blanched, drained vegetable pieces flat on a shallow tray. Place the tray in the freezer. Fill freezer bags or freezer containers with the frozen vegetables. Label each bag or container with a felt tip marker. Place the sealed, labeled packages into a freezer. Keep the temperature of your freezer set at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).
This makes one less side that can be accessed to tow your vehicle.; , This makes it nearly impossible to tow your vehicle from the back end unless it is put on a flat bed tow truck. In this case, it will at least make it more difficult to get onto the bed of the tow truck.  While this doesn't keep your vehicle from being towed, it will make it more difficult. , By enabling the 4-wheel-drive system (automatic 4-wheel-drive doesn't count, you have to select a full-time mode), the drivetrain is all locked together, and requires all four wheels to move together. By selecting 4-LO, the low gearing will undoubtedly hold the vehicle where you parked it. Don't forget to disable 4WD when you decide to leave, otherwise damage may occur to the drivetrain when operating 4WD on pavement.  This makes it almost impossible for your vehicle to be towed.	Park against a full curb in back or front of the vehicle, if possible. Turn your wheels to the side as much as possible. Set your parking or emergency brake as hard as you can. Utilize the 'club' or some steering wheel locking device.  , If you have a 4-Wheel-Drive system on your vehicle, select the 4-HI setting, or if you really want to take the extra time and make it as absolutely difficult as possible, enable the 4-LO mode. You can also park between two cars, one in front of you and one in back of you.You can use wheel lock to make it immobilized.
It is very challenging to learn this piece without the audio aid.; , The steps in this article are based on that tab. Understand that the measures are divided by a dotted line, not a solid line. I assume that this is because, for the first half of the piece, Eddie doesn't really follow any definable time signature. There are some parts of this tab which are a bit off, due to the extreme speed of his playing. A friend of mine and I know this to be true, because we used a program named "Sony Acid Pro" to slow it down to half speed, where we could listen to and distinguish every note being played.  This is the tuning he uses, and it really does help the speed, because the strings are looser.  This is not optional.    In measure 1, ignore what they say, and start with a slide down from fret 7 on the A string. Measure 2 is authentic, but you can ignore the palm mutes if you want. If you don't want to, palm mute LIGHTLY. Measure 3 is a bit more challenging. Up to the point where you play fret 5 on both b and high-e strings, it is authentic. After that, the publishers made a mistake. Each sequence of -8-5-0- on the b string followed by -8- on the g string followed by open e string is actually -8-5-0- followed by -8- on the b string the first time through, only you leave the open e string out, and hold the -8- on the g string for emphasis. After that, it is actually -5-8-5-0-, with no g or e string at all. (Note the different sequence on the b string. This is the correct way to play it.) The exact same rule applies to the beginning of measure 4, where the sequence is repeated one more time. Measure 4 is literally almost half wrong. After the already corrected sequence, he doesn't play -7- on g, -5- on b, and then -5- on e. He actually plays open d, -7- on g, and -5- on b. He doesn't play the following -8-5- pull-off on b, the -7- 1/2 bend on g, or the -5- on b, so skip 'em. From then until the end of measure 4 is correct. Measure 5 is correct up until the slide from -3- to -15- on the (a) string. But this is easy to correct...simply play the -3- and leave out the slide. Note the dive-bomb with the whammy bar on open e. Do not play the little -15- (on a) to open-a pull-off. It is incorrect. When you play the chord progression in measures 6 and 7, have fun with it. This is usually where he does the scissors 4 feet (1.2 m) in the air, so play it nice and slowly with a lot of emphasis. At the end of measure 7, the slide is not from -3- to natural harmonic at -19- on the b string. It is actually from -2- to natural harmonic at -19- on the g string. In measure 8, do not bend the last -20- (on b) of the -20- (on b) to -17- (on e) sequence. Leave out the -20- that comes right after you play the open g. In measure 9, do not bend the second -19- (on b) 1 1/2. Instead, bend the -20- (on b) one full bend. Also, when you have just finished the full -20- (on e) bend, and you have pulled off to -17- (on e) do not play the -17- (on e) after you have played the -20- (on b). Just go into the next sequence. In measure 10, do not play the whammy bar from -20- on b. Move on to the slide. Until measure 18, the tabs are correct. Polish your picking skills. You will be picking very, very quickly from measure 12 to measure 17. Measures 18 and 19 have some faults. Ignore the -7- to -8- slide on the d string, and, right after that, instead of what they say, play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -6-0-5- (on b) followed by -7-0-5- (on g) followed by -8-0-7-5- on (on b) first bending and then trilling the last -5-. At the end of measure 19, leave out the open d string, and slide from open e to -7- on e instead of -5- to -7-. Measures 20 and 21 make up the exact same tune of measures 18 and 19, only transposed. Instead of playing the -7- (on a) after you do the second -5-0- pull-off (on d) hammer on a -4- (on d) and then play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -7-0-5- (on d) followed by -7-0-6-4- (on g) and trill the last -4- half a step. At the end of measure 21, through measure 22, repeat the same sequence that you played in measures 18 and 19, and it's easier to transpose the -11-9-11-9-and so on (on g) in measures 22 and 23 up to the b string, where you would start with -7-5-7-5-. Measure 24 through measure 39 is totally two hand tapping. Eddie actually plays it on the b string, not the g string, so if you transpose (which is advisable since it's actually easier the way he does it) then you would start with -14-2-5- (b string) and then go into -9-2-5- (also b string). In measures 31, 32, and 33 where he starts his decent, the (transposed to b string) the notes are actually -17-12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12--17-12-15- -12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12- and so on.

In particular, you will want to gather as much information as you can about your vehicle's specific wiring colors, the locations of those wires, and the wires' polarities. Knowing these things beforehand can save you a lot of time and frustration mid-installation.; , You will need to know how your specific car alarm interfaces with your SUV. Plan out the installation locations and wiring routes beforehand in order to save time later.  In particular, make sure that your doors trigger the "door ajar" light on the dashboard when they are open. In the case that a door does not trigger the light, there is a good chance that the door won't trigger the car alarm. , Once you have a suitable location, mount it securely according to the instructions specific to your car alarm. You can find those instructions in the car alarm's manual.  Try to install the car alarm in a hidden place.  All of these alarm component wiring instructions should be included in your car alarm manual. Make sure you pay attention to where the wires should be cut or altered.   It is strongly recommended that you test wire polarities before making connections. , The car alarm manual should explain how to do this, but the wiring can grow tricky at this step. If further assistance is needed, it is recommended that you contact a technical advisor. , If you encounter any problems with the alarm, troubleshoot them as soon as possible.	Gather information regarding your SUV's paneling and wiring. Study your vehicle design alongside your car alarm's installation manual. Check your SUV for any problems before beginning installation. Remove the necessary panels in your vehicle depending on the vehicle model and your car alarm model.  , Look under the hood of your SUV and choose a location for the placement of your car alarm's siren. Look around the interior of your SUV and locate a suitable mount area for your car alarm near the dashboard. Wire the valet switch, LED light, and external antenna that come with the alarm. Connect the car alarm power wire directly to the vehicle's battery under the hood.  , Install the car alarm's shock detector and door lock mechanisms. Replace the panels in your SUV.  , Walk through your car alarm's testing instructions in the manual.
Only prune your orchid once the flowers wither and die. The spike attached to the blooms should begin to yellow, as well.  You should see the vertical spike emerging from a wide, green section of plant material, known as the bud sheath. When you shine a light at the back of this sheath, you should be able to see the lower part of the spike.   Note that a bud sheath will either be green or papery brown. Color is not necessarily an indication of sheath health, though. The bud sheath protects immature buds as they bloom and will not die off even when the flowers and spike are dying. Make sure that the sheath is an old one. Ideally, you should see flowers or spikes visible. If you cannot see any from the top of the sheath, squeeze the sheath gently to make sure that there are no fresh, healthy buds inside.  Trace the sheath down the stem, toward the pseudobulb. The sheath and its spike originate at the top of this pseudobulb, usually protected by one or two leaves.   Note that the pseudobulb is a portion of the stem that emerges directly above the ground. It is wider than the rest of the stem and looks somewhat bulb-shaped.  Hold the upper part of the sheath and spike steady with your non-dominant hand. Use a sharp cutting tool to cut through both the sheath and the spike, positioning the cut as close to the base of the protective leaves as possible.   Do not cut through the leaves or the pseudobulb.	Wait for the flowers to fade. Find the old bud sheath. Locate the point at which the bud sheath meets the stem. Cut through the sheath and the spike.
Just like with a small child, it is important to mark out your tree's growth during the first 2 years of its life in order to determine its adult form.   After permanently planting your olive tree, the first pruning should be done in summer. Using pruning shears, get rid of all secondary shoots less than 30 inches (76.2 cm) in length.; , To do this, you should tie the main trunk in order to keep secondary shoots from growing.   Starting at the base, wrap a gardening rope or a normal rope around the olive tree's trunk until you reach a height of 40 inches (101.6 cm). The ties should be firm, but not too tight, because this could strangulate the trunk and cause the upper branches to dry out. To keep this from happening, change the rope out for a new one regularly.  During the first year and a half, it is highly probably that secondary shoots will continue to appear, despite having correctly pruned the tree.   Check weekly for the growth of new secondary shoots. If you happen to find one, cut it off with pruning shears while it is still green or it will become more difficult to remove it and multiple new shoots will appear around that spot in the following weeks.	Orient your olive tree's growth. Assure that your tree grows correctly. Frequently check the secondary shoots.
Pretend they're not there. Just act as if you cannot see them, hear them or feel their presence. Act as if they aren't about at all.; , If you are bugged by a decision they've made or something they've said, go overboard in the upset stakes. Show them you're upset and if they ask you to do something hang your head low and say you've got plans or quickly run to the toilet. This will make them worried about you, making sure that you don't get the blame for what happens tomorrow.  Don't just sing, sing horribly, kind of like a walrus dying of suffocation. Aka, really bad. Also, make it a really annoying song.  Self explanatory.  For example, "How does the reproductive system of a duck work?" Say it over and over again.  Say something really sweet, and then put JK or LOL or ROFL at the end of it.  Whoopee cushions are outdated. Here are better pranks. Use a pinprick to make some tiny holes in a drink straw. Or, wait for a rainy day and make paper confetti, put it in an umbrella and then watch when someone opens it.   Plenty more pranks can be found in wikiHow's pranking category.  Ask a simple question and when they answer, just ask "Why?" after every answer.  When they look over at you, hide behind your hands. As if by hiding your face in your hands, they won't see you. Then repeat.  For example, "Hey , hey , hey , hey , guess what? I'm bored!" It works like a charm.  This is perfect if you have patience. If they say a word that's really long and you can't quite remember, just say "blah". Works every time.   While mimicking, use a really annoying voice. It could be anything from squeaky and high-pitched to a simple accent.  Not nice comments, either; comments that come across as cynical, disbelieving and deflating are the best. This works well while talking in a small group.  If your teacher says, "Clean up your desk!" to your friend, whisper, "Yeah , clean up your desk!" Make sure the teacher can't hear you.	Ignore them. Overdo the sorrow. Sing. Make a really annoying noise. Say something really dumb. Pretend to be really, really deep. Prank them. Try the "why" game. Poke the person constantly. Repeat something over and over again. Mimic them. Comment on everything they say. Just repeat every instruction they are given.
A warm, sunny, southern or western exposure is best. Shelter is a big help, too, if cold is a concern. Choose or create someplace with well-drained soil, and avoid putting a citrus tree directly into a lawn. A nearby reflective wall, fence, or even patio can provide both shelter and a bit of extra warmth, too.       ; ,  Choose the type of citrus you would like to try growing (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, etc.).              Ask the nursery about the climate that the particular tree is suitable for.              Ask about or look up the season for the tree(s) you intend to get. Citrus generally ripens in winter, but different fruits ripen throughout the year, as well. If you live somewhere that's a bit colder than a strictly Mediterranean climate, look into cultivars bred for cold resistance. Taste the fruit, if you have the opportunity. Not all oranges are alike. If you can taste fruit grown on a tree in your area, perhaps from a neighbor, even better.              Find out if the fruit produced has many seeds, or not.              Ask for certification of the health of the tree, or ask someone who's experienced with citrus trees to inspect it. See Warnings.  Ask at the nursery or look up online how large the mature tree will get.          Try dwarf citrus trees if you are short on space. You can even grow them in large pots, and they open up the possibility of covering the entire tree in a shelter during the delicate winter months or even bringing the tree indoors. Even though they are small, dwarf citrus trees can produce a very reasonable harvest. On the other end of the spectrum, a couple of large lemon trees can form a good-sized hedgerow. It all depends on just how much citrus you want.  The saying goes that you should dig at least a $60 hole for a $20 tree. As a practical matter, make sure you know where you want to place the tree, then dig a hole that is about three feet (1 meter) in diameter and as deep as the container. Do not bury the root crown, the transition from trunk to roots, as this will cause problems down the road. Plant the tree slightly higher than the surrounding soil to allow for some settling, most container grown nursery stock has high organic matter content that will decompose causing the plant to settle in the planting hole dropping the root crown below grade if not planted slightly high.          If you have any concerns about drainage, such as in heavy clay soil, fill the hole with water and see how long it takes to drain out. If you have drainage problems (that is, if the water is not gone by the next morning), dig the hole even deeper and plant the tree up higher.              For a dwarf citrus tree, select a large pot. Try for two feet in diameter or a half-barrel, at least.  Depending on the quality of what you took out of the hole, you might try a half-and-half mixture of compost and the now-loosened soil. Create a mound of soil in the middle of the hole that supports the root ball with the crown (the base of the tree trunk where the roots begin) slightly above it.  Mix in some citrus fertilizer with the soil, if you like.              If you are planting a dwarf citrus in a pot, use straight potting soil and fill it in to a similar level. Place the pot up on blocks and be sure there are plenty of drainage holes in the bottom. Don't let the pot sit directly in a saucer or puddle of water.  Place the tree on the mound of soil. Add or remove soil underneath to adjust the height so that the crown is level with the soil or even slightly above it.           If you are using a pot, fill with straight potting soil. Leave at least two inches at the top to allow space to water thoroughly.           Stay away from organic mulch, as it increases the likelihood of foot rot disease. A safe bet is that the roots are at least as wide as the branches, so make the mulch area at least this large. You can even add a rim of mulch around the circumference of the circle to aid in watering. Do not mulch right up to the base of the trunk. Leave a little margin so that the crown has breathing room and doesn't stay wet when you water.  Water even mature citrus trees regularly. Citrus trees have relatively shallow, broad root systems. Once established, the trees may tolerate some drought, but they won't produce fruit that's as good.  Fertilizers are available in citrus or citrus-and-avocado formulations. Apply them according to package instructions, typically three to four times a year for slow-release types.  They don't require heavy or regular pruning.  Remove any "suckers", or shoots growing from the rootstock. Citrus trees are grafted, meaning that a tree with desirable fruit is cut and attached to a sturdier rootstock. You don't want the rootstock taking over.              Remove any "wild" shoots growing beyond the general shape of the tree. These will often be long, straight, quick-growing branches that don't follow the overall form or shape of the tree.              Moderately thin the foliage if it grows excessively dense, to promote air circulation and availability of light. Generally, train citrus trees as shrubs or hedges. If you'd like to remove a few lower branches to give it more of a tree shape, go ahead, but don't overdo it.  Oranges, lemons, and grapefruit should all be completely free of green coloring. They will not ripen off the tree. Limes are generally picked green, so go by size and season. See the external links for more details on limes.	Choose a location for your tree. Select and obtain a tree. Choose a size of tree that is appropriate for your setting. Dig a large hole. Partially refill the hole with good, well-draining soil. Remove the tree from its pot and remove any burlap around the roots. Fill in the remaining hole with a mixture of compost or potting soil and the soil from your garden. Do not apply mulch. Water the tree at least weekly until it is established, unless you get sufficient rain to do the job. Fertilize the tree with an appropriate fertilizer. Prune citrus trees occasionally. Harvest fruit when it is fully ripe.
Playing this song will be different based on what instruments the musicians are using. In many variations of "Mad World" the major instrument is the piano. However, for other musical presentations, the guitar is the lead instrument. Think about which instruments are best for a specific rendition of this song.; , Sheet music for the song shows the intro as being composed of two chords: F minor and B flat major. Playing these two alternately will provide the back-and-forth kind of sound featured in the introduction to "Mad World."  , When the song is played with F minor as the base chord, the verse chord progression would be from F minor to A flat, E flat and B flat and back to F minor.   Think about alternatives for the key of the song. Changing the key can make the song sound a bit different. For instance, some versions of sheet music for "Mad World" use the chords E minor and A major for the intro. Being able to change keys for a song quickly is part of what makes a musician more experienced and professional, and it's worth putting some time into the study of relative chord progressions in order to be able to effectively change keys.  For example, if using the introduction chords F minor and B flat major, return to this same chord alternation for the chorus.   Listen to the way the alternating chords match the vocal chorus line: "I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad ..." Here, the timely resolution back to F minor is part of what makes the song feel a certain way. Getting this feeling right is part of playing this song well.  The pace of the chords is very important for "Mad World." Again, listen to the lyrics and try to make the pace of musical play match the vocals and the overall ethos of the song. Getting the sound right will evoke associations with the original version and make your version sound good.	Choose instrumentation. Utilize the common chord progression for the introduction. Use a different chord progression for the verse. Go back to the original chord progression for the chorus. Work on tempo.
A brown paper bag with crinkling is ideal for creating a weathered or parched look for your ancient explorer's map.; , If you are trying to make the map look tattered and worn, distressed edging would be best, with a few holes, gashes and tears here and there. Perhaps considering burning the edges in the way of the treasure maps. Or, you could cut it nice and straight into a rectangle or square, common map shapes. Consider how the map will end up being mounted as you make the shape too–the framing or board for mounting might determine some of the sizing.  Work out the key places in the world or area that they visited, as well as some important features of their exploration.  It is important to try to make the map as they would have know it in their time, most certainly this will not be a modern day map. Look online or visit the library to find old maps. Map shop staff might be able to help you out with older map versions if you're having trouble finding them.  This line should represent the voyage that the explorers have taken, from start to finish. Along this line, place stars, or some other clear symbol, to highlight points of great interest in the exploration.  Write down the names of the areas, and add any facts in speech bubbles or similar externally stuck on notes. Use arrows if needed to make it clear. Alternately, you might like to use pictorial representations of what the explorers discovered, such as pictures of fur, coal, gold, local people, pastures, housing etc. Look online for good photos and print off high quality versions. Photoshop anything that needs to be made to fit or to stand out in a certain way etc.  Add your signature or a mock explorer's signature if wished. If you are using the map for promotional purposes, add any extra details to promote your business, product, hobby, display, etc.  Once you are satisfied with its contents, frame or mount it as you wish.	Use a paper bag. Cut it into a shape that suits your needs. Do some research the explorer's voyage you are doing. Draw the world map or a zoomed map near the area where the explorer traveled on the map. Draw a colored line on the voyage on the map. Add details to the starred areas. Sign it off. Frame or mount the map.
This is the best time to water your garden because it works with the plants' natural growth cycle. The plants are ready to drink early in the morning, when the sun is up but not quite high in the sky. During the rest of the day, they'll be able to drink in the water before the sun gets hot. Hydrated plants are better able to withstand extreme heat.If you wait until noon or later, when the sun is very hot, the water can actually burn the plants. The sun-heated water will get too hot for the fragile stems and leaves, and it will leave damage in its wake. Try to water your garden before 10 am, to make sure the water has plenty of time to seep into the soil and dry a little before the sun gets strong. Watering in the afternoon wastes your water, since more of it will evaporate before soaking into the soil.; , It's not always convenient to water first thing in the morning when you have a million other things to do. If you miss the morning watering, wait until late afternoon, when the sun is no longer at its hottest. This way your plants won't get burned, and there will still be time for them to dry out a little before nightfall.If you wait until the afternoon, aim to water from 4 pm on, since before that time the sun may still be strong enough to burn your plants. If you absolutely must water when the sun is strong, try to do so only occasionally, rather than making it an everyday habit.  When you water at night, the water sits on the leaves and stems of the plants instead of evaporating. The soil may become water-logged instead of draining properly with help from the sun. This is detrimental to your plants because it leads to mold and fungal growth around the roots and on the stems and leaves.   Only water at night as a very last resort, if your plants are very thirsty and you can't wait until morning. If you must water at night, water the soil to avoid getting the plant itself wet, and use less water to avoid waterlogging. Irrigation tape or a soaker hose makes this much easier.  The general rule for gardens is that they need about one inch of water per week. However, certain types of plants need more water than this, and certain types need less. The best approach is to research your plants' water requirements, and to keep an eye on their health.If a plant wilts, it needs more water.   Another good test is to insert your finger a few inches into the soil. If it feels completely dry, it's probably time to water. If it's wet just below the surface, give it more time. Use common sense when it comes to the frequency with which you water your plants. For example, if it has been a rainy week, your plants don't need as much water. If you're in a drought, they might need extra water.  The roots absorb water that nourishes the plant; water that hits the leaves just drips off or evaporates. When you're watering, point the hose, watering can or sprinkler low on the plant, near the roots, to make sure the plant gets adequately watered there.   Watering over the plant and getting the leaves all wet is also detrimental to the plant's health. Water that sits on the leaves can either cause mold to form or cause the plant to overheat. If you find it difficult to water the roots using your hose, look into a special watering system that waters plants close to the ground, such as a soaker hose or a drip-tape irrigation system.  Most plants are healthiest when their roots grow deep into the ground, rather than growing outward and closer to the surface. Watering deeply, so that you completely saturate the soil, ensures that water gets all the way to the tips of the roots, and it encourages downward root growth.   That's why it's healthiest to water plants sparingly, but deeply. Instead of watering just a little bit every day, choose one or two days a week to give the plants a good, deep watering. That means spending a full thirty seconds or more on each area, rather than just spraying the garden down quickly.  Plants that are getting too much water are just as likely to die as plants that get too little water. Make sure you're watering your plants at the correct frequency, and try not to overdo it. Look for these signs that your garden might be getting too much water:   Leaves that are yellow or brownish at the tips Limp, soggy foliage Signs of rot	Water in the morning if possible. Water in the late afternoon if the morning is inconvenient. Do not water your garden at night. Water your garden with the correct frequency. Water near the roots, not over the leaves. Water long and deep. Check for signs of overwatering.
To be a medicine cat you will need knowledge on herbs and how they work. You will also need a pretty strong connection with Starclan.; , Stick to the warrior code, and make up prophecies to tell to friends and have people fulfill.  You have to know ALL of them, even the poisons that can kill you and the ones not used for cats or not generally used frequently. The main herbs are feverfew, for fever; marigold, for infection; poppy seeds for pain; catmint, for greencough; tansy, for coughs; and cobwebs, for bleeding. ,, Be sure you don't lose them. Stow them in a box outside. When you are out in the yard and it's not raining, open it to let the air come in.  You can still hang out with friends though, because even medicine cats have fun once in a while.  Be as busy as you can, and rush around the house often searching for a "certain herb that looks like parsley."  , You have to do lots of things being a medicine cat, and those are supposed to take up the bored time you have and make your life busier.  Being a medicine cat, you will have to set a time each month, if possible at night, to go to a certain pond, maybe lake, or a puddle, and if you aren't able to do that, a set place. Another idea is to make a Moonstone, which would be easier to find.  Find someone interested in herbs, and let them be trained by you. ,, You can use catspeak, but don't fight or seem a bit too close to it, because medicine cats never fight unless they have to (which means only if they are fighting a badger or fox).	Read up. Have a strong connection with Starclan. Know your herbs very well. When someone gets sick, suggest using an appropriate herbs, if none, then just go the normal way.  , Never mess up your herbs, and always fuss around with herbs.  , Go outside and search for certain herbs when you have spare time. Almost always be in your "den," either tending to sick cats or fussing around with herbs. Don't forget your duties. Never be bored!, Make sure you have time to go to the Moonpool!, Train your very own apprentice!, Last but not least, have fun being an herb obsessed medicine cat with everything you will need!  , Share medicine cat tips with medicine cats from other Clans, since medicine cats from each Clan are usually not rivals and are mostly friendly.  , Don't act like a warrior. Although hunting is typically a warrior duty, you are allowed to hunt once in a while to take a break from your medicine duties.
Acting, despite the term, is not simply acting like someone else... it is practically being someone else!; , You need to know your character up and down. You must know him/her/it better than you know your best friend: his traits, his habits, how old he is, his hopes and dreams and fears, his past, even the way he walks. A nosy woman could walk like a bird and constantly raise her eyebrows. A grouchy old man could have a limp and the saddest facial expression. If the details aren't specified by your director, make it up. Bring the character to life!  , KNOW THEM! If you don't have your lines memorized, you're sunk! A performance is powerful and smooth if you know what you are supposed to say. I admit, it can be difficult. To help with memorization, you can write down your lines several times. You can practice with friends and family. Practice in front of the mirror, with feeling! Practice does make perfect!  , Blocking is where you are supposed to move and what you are doing with your body. A well-placed gesture can make a dull line interesting. But be careful not to mime everything you're saying.  Your comfort zone is irrelevant. Be must LOUD, get out there! Do not be afraid to make a fool of yourself. When people laugh at you during a performance, you are entertaining them! (This may not be a good sign during a sad, dramatic play though...) Looking and sounding like a total idiot makes for great comedy.  Do not just plow through your lines as soon as the other person finishes! For example, if your co-star says, "Look, a fire-breathing dragon!", jump and frantically look around before you speak.  The fourth wall is the imaginary wall between the audience and the actors. Unless you are specifically told to interact with the audience, DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING BEHIND THAT WALL. Never ever ever break character. Never giggle when you aren't supposed to. Don't let it be known to the audience that you forgot your line.  If you forgot your lines, think of what your character would say in their situation and say it! (This is difficult in a rhyming script.) Always help out your co-stars, too. For example, if he was supposed to say, "Wow, she is beautiful...", you can cover for him by saying, "I bet you think she's beautiful. Your eyes are popping out of your head." Improvising is difficult, which is why you need to know your lines.  Be respectful to the cast, the directors, and most especially the undervalued crew. Even if you aren't on the best terms with the cast members, put that aside so you can have a wonderful performance! The crew (lights, sound, props and costume workers) is often treated unfairly by the cast because they didn't get a role. Do not tease them. They are important. Keep in mind that your performance would be nothing without them.  You have done everything to prepare. You know your lines and your blocking. The cast and crew is well-rested and ready to go. Your play is darn near perfect! (Maybe not, but always give it your best try.) Relax, go through your lines, and fight back those butterflies! It's really fun to do a warm-up with the whole cast. Break a leg!	Know what acting is!, Know your character!, Learn your lines!, Know the blocking. Be confident!, Get the timing right. Understand the Fourth Wall. If you desperately need to, improvise!, Respect everyone involved. Performance Day!!
Naturally, people want to get their money's worth, and therefore practice is the key to generating revenue.; , Get a Myspace, or even a domain name, and advertise what you do- you won't get any gigs if no-one's heard of you!  , In other words, join as many bands as possible, and push for gigs with them-the more mud you throw, the more will stick.  Even though you're not getting any money, it's still marketing, and doing a good job that is exposed to an audience can never be a bad thing.  You are the client, and they are the boss, and therefore don't try to demand food, drink etc; stick to whatever terms you have previously agreed upon.  If they say, "can you turn down a bit?" or "can you play for a bit longer, please", do so.  This is basic salesmanship, if a person likes you, they will prefer to have you than someone arrogant and unhelpful.  Often, punters will find it hard to remember the names of bands they have seen, so give them a memory aid.  You never know where they might lead. Always be gracious, and should a band disband, for example, keep in touch. If a previous band member goes on to do bigger and better things, you'll want to be a part of it.  Often, you can never be overdressed, and a suit or tie will make you seem much more professional and intelligent than your peers. If it is a rock gig, however, you probably can stray from the "smart" look.  Don't play overcomplicated songs that might alienate them, or songs that would not appeal to your target audience. Play whatever you want for fun, but when money is involved, what the audience wants is what the audience gets.	Be good at what you do. Market yourself. Mudsling. Don't knock unpaid gigs. When you start to get gigs, be reasonable. Be flexible, and tailor your set to their needs, they will doubtless think higher of you, and will therefore be more likely to ask for you back, or do a favor for you in return. Be friendly. Have business cards and fliers. Never sever existing connections. Always dress to impress. Know your audience.
The check engine light will likely be on.  If the catalytic converter is glowing, it's probably clogged. You will have to replace the converter if you find this to be the problem.	Look for stalling, no power when accelerating. Look under the car at night after the vehicle has been running for a while.
This is the longest installation process, because you are actually replacing your sink tap with a Brita brand tap and hoses.  Run your tap water and insert the testing strip Consult the instructions to see under what filtration setting you should set the filter according to your results. , Place a bucket underneath the pipes. Unscrew the pipes with a wrench so that you can remove your current kitchen sink faucet.  Keep the directions close at hand in case you need to identify parts.  The shank is a collar-like metal piece.  Screw the blue hoses into the hole marked “C.” Screw the red hose into the hole marked “H.”   Screw the last hose into the hole marked “B.” Make sure they are secure.  Screw it into the bottom of the tap. , Pull the hoses and shank through the hole.  Loop them through the hoses in that order.  Adjust the dispenser at the top, so that it is positioned correctly. Fix the dispenser in place at the bottom using a wrench.  The red hose will connect with the hot water supply. Next, insert the gasket into the T-piece, which you will place over the cold water intake.  Insert the gaskets into the remaining hoses. Connect each side to the Brita filter device.

This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam.There are several different types of floral foam. Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop.   Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this. You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh. Be careful when handling this type of foam. It is very soft when dry and easily dented.  You can use a fancy bowl, planter, vase, or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles. It should sit below the rim of your bowl, planter, or vase.If the foam is too big, cut it down to the right size and shape.   If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal, cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape., You can use roses in all one color, or you can experiment using different colors. You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect.Plan on using about 48 roses.If you plan on using multiple shades or colors, put them into separate buckets. This will make sorting through them easier.Consider using fragrant roses. This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch., Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle.It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well.   If your foam block is very small, you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (7.63 centimeters).  Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch.Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible. You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam.   If you are sticking the roses into a bowl, planter, or vase, consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect. If you are going for an ombre effect, start with your lightest color, then move on to the darkest.You can arrange it in stripes or rings.  At this point, your centerpiece is done. You can move it to the table, and leave it as is, or you can add some more touches to it. Here are some ideas:   Arrange short, votive candles around the centerpiece.Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece. Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel.	Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight. Put the foam block into a vessel. Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water. Cut about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off of each stem. Poke the roses into the foam. Add some finishing touches.
Art is very personal and it is not always meant to make you feel good. As a result, you may offend people by giving harsh criticism. Instead, you can comment on the art itself, without saying whether or not you like it. This allows you to comment on the work without giving your personal feelings.Avoid saying things like "I could make that." This type of comment is insulting to the artist and does not promote artistic conversation. If you do dislike a piece, you can explain that it's due to your personal taste. For instance, you can say, "I can see this is well composed. I have trouble looking at this image, though, because it's so dynamic it almost feels violent.”  , A great way to assess a piece of art is by asking questions. If you're going to talk about art, questions are a great way to learn from your companions and promote conversation.Ask if your companion knows much about the artist or the art movement in question. Get the opinion of your companion about a piece.  If you are visiting an art gallery with a group of friends or colleagues and you do not know much about the kind of art you're viewing, feel free to admit to confusion at any point. Some people in your group may actually be relieved to discover that they are not the only person outside of their comfort zone.Pretending to know a lot will be awkward, and isn't necessary. You might say, "Wow, I can tell a lot is going on here, but I don't know where to start."  , The most important thing when you are thinking and talking about art is that it makes you feel something, even if that feeling is unpleasant. Comment on how the piece makes you feel and why. Sometimes the artist will intentionally want the audience to feel uncomfortable. This does not mean you need to judge the quality of work, just the impression that the piece has left on you.For example, you may feel inspired, sad, happy, confused, uncomfortable, angry, etc.	Avoid delivering unnecessary judgements. Ask questions. Acknowledge that you are not an expert. Talk about how the art makes you feel.
While it is fairly easy to install small letters using a dry method, you are far better off using a wet release method providing your supplier offers this goof proof method of installation.; , Some websites allow you to actually design your boat name lettering online, see it on a boat, then order it.  The most difficult part of installing the boat name is that boat names are fairly large decals and it's real easy to tangle them or accidentally seal in large bubbles of air, which is a disaster. Not so with a good wet release system. , Place this solution in a spray bottle. Bring this along with your wet release boat name lettering or registration number decal and a Rubbermaid kitchen spatula or other rubberized straight edge.  Once in place, use black tape or any contrasting color tape to mark your position.  Also spray the decal (sticky side) as you pull the backing away. This will prevent the decal from immediately bonding to the boat or to itself if you should fumble finger the thing.  Slide it around until it hits your marks made in step 6.  Once you are comfortable you have pushed out all the solution you can begin to push firmer and firmer. Go slow. The solution may be pushed out but the decal still has not bonded yet.  Take a break. Cover the whole decal with a moist towel or at the very least, shade it from the sun. Time and moisture will cause the pre-masking to release both from the boat and from the decal.  In about an hour, you should be able to pull the pre-masking off the decal and the letters will stay firmly in place.	Note that there are a number of methods used to apply vinyl boat lettering to the transom of your boat. Go online and search for wet release boat name decals. Look for a wet release system, you can nearly guarantee a perfect job every time. Clean your boat transom or the sides of your boat that will receive the decals.  , Mix a solution of 1 cup of water and about 6-8 drops of Palmolive dish washing detergent. Hold your decal into position and play with it with the backing still on until you get it in the exact position you want. Spray the boat with a good heavy coating of your solution mix. Place the decal in position. Starting in the center, gently squeegee out the solution first working to the right, then to the left. Notice that the application masking that holds your boat name letters in place will begin to turn milky and break down with the solution (the letters themselves are not water soluble, they bond firmer as they dry while the pre-masking breaks down) This process can take a few minutes to an hour or more. Wait.
Summer and fall blooming clematis only produce buds on new growth wood. The pruning can take place anytime from late autumn to early spring. These types of clematis include Polish Spirit and Duchess of Albany., A hard cut refers to a pruning method that essentially cuts the plant back to the ground. In the case of these late blooming clematis, you will cut these plants back nearly to the ground. Some of these clematis will have buds up on the stems, in which case cut just above the buds, but most will just grow back right out of the crown of the plant.Aim for cutting your clematis back to a height between 12 and 18 inches.	Understand that late blooming clematis should be cut back hard. Give your clematis a hard cut.
You will need 1 cup (280 grams) of salt and 1 cup (140 grams) of flour. If you wish to add glitter to your clay, you can do so now. Start with 1 teaspoon of glitter. You can use fine, scrapbooking glitter or chunky, craft glitter, but the fine glitter will be easier to blend. Pour everything into a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.  You will need ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of warm water. If you wish make colored dough, you can add a few drops of food coloring into the water at this point.  Keep kneading until you have achieved a smooth, dough-like texture.   If the dough is too dry, add a little bit more water. If the dough is too sticky, add some more flour.  Your clay is now ready to use. You can sculpt little figurines out of it, or roll it out and make ornaments out of it.  Start by rolling your clay out flat using a rolling pin. Cut your clay into shapes using a craft knife, a cookie cutter, or a drinking glass. If you wish to hang the ornament, poke a hole near the top of the shape using a drinking straw or a toothpick.   Salt dough can make great keepsakes. Press your child's foot or hand into the dough until there is an imprint.  Transfer your creations onto a baking sheet and bake them in your oven at 212°F (100°C) for three hours. If the dough still hasn't hardened, flip the item over, and bake it for two more hours.	Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Measure out the water. Pour the water into the salt and flour, and knead. Transfer the clay onto a flat surface. Consider making some ornaments or keepsakes with the dough. Consider baking the dough.
Many online vendors sell spandex face-masks, called Morph Masks. If you're planning on making a Spiderman suit to go with your mask, you can buy a full-body Morph Suit as well. Look for a plain red Morph Mask at a costume depot or order one online. It should cost around 15 dollars.; , There are many different versions of Spiderman, between the comics and the films. Some Spiderman costumes feature dark eye-lenses, while others show a Spiderman with bright, reflective eyes. Buy a large pair of sunglasses in the tint that you prefer for your costume, dark or bright.Make sure the glasses have very large lenses. Each lens will become an eye on your mask, so take some reference pictures of Spiderman with you when you go shopping. Look in the women's sunglasses section, as many women's styles feature larger lenses.  For an alternative look, consider using a sheet of silver or dark auto tint for the eyes of your mask. It will make for a similar effect as the sunglasses, but the material is flexible instead of rigid. You can ask an auto detailing shop if they have any scraps, then cut it into the shape of the eyes. You won't need very much, so they should be able to help you out., To create the "web" pattern on Spiderman's mask, you'll have to decide between a black Sharpie or black fabric paint. This will depend on your aesthetic preference. Sharpie will create flat, matte lines, while puff paint or fabric paint will create raised, textured lines. Be aware that you may have to hand-wash your mask regardless of which marker type you choose. Both can be damaged by machine washing., Many craft stores carry inexpensive hot glue guns. Pick one up or use one that you already own. Make sure that you have plenty of glue sticks handy so that you don't run out in the middle of your project.  Lay the spandex mask on a flat surface, like a table or desk. Make sure you lay it with the front facing up, because you'll obviously want to draw the eyes on the front of the mask. If you have a styrofoam head or dummy head, feel free to use this as well. It will give you a better vantage point for designing your mask and visualizing it on your own head., Using a pencil or a ballpoint pen, sketch out the size and shape of the eyes that you want. Use a reference photo to get an idea of how you want the eyes to look, relative to the mask size. Remember to check your sunglasses against the eye size: you want the sunglasses' lenses to be larger than the size of the eyes.  Put one hand inside the mask, then hold a pair of scissors with your other hand. Carefully pierce a hole directly on the line of one eye, then begin to cut along the line. Once the first eye is completely cut out, do the same for the second eye. Make sure that your scissors are sharp and your hands are steady, otherwise your cuts could turn out jagged or uneven.Look at photos of Spiderman as a reference to get an idea of the shape of the eyes. In most incarnations of Spiderman, his eyes are roughly triangular, with a straight line on top and a U-shaped line forming the lower eyelid.  The lenses of most sunglasses will pop out easily when you apply pressure. Hold the frame with both hands, then push out the lenses gently with your thumbs. Make sure not to push too hard, or the lenses might break., Let your hot glue gun warm up, then apply a thin line to the outside of one lens. Holding the neck of the mask open with one hand, use your other hand to move the glued lens inside of the mask. Hold the lens directly under one of the eye holes, then adhere the glue to the fabric inside the mask. Make sure that the eye hole is completely filled by the lens, and that there are no gaps.Apply the second lens. Using the exact same method, glue a thin line to the other lens and then affix it to the inside of the mask, creating the second eye. If you place the lens incorrectly at first, you will have a few seconds to move it before the glue dries. Apply light pressure to the side of the lens to fill the eye-hole while the glue is still hot. The glue will take around 15 seconds to set, so keep in mind the amount of time you have left to make changes.  Spiderman has thick black borders around both eyes, so you'll need to draw these on. Using your sharpie or fabric paint, sketch out a 1/2" border around each eye, then fill it in completely. If you are feeling a bit more ambitious, cut out some black fabric from an old t-shirt in the correct shape, then hot-glue it on.  Look in a comic book or online for a reference photo, then copy Spiderman's web patterns onto the mask. If you're uncomfortable free-handing the webs, try sketching them on with a pencil first, then erasing and adjusting till they're just right. Then, use your Sharpie or Fabric paint to draw over the penciled lines., Now that your mask has been hot-glued and accented, you'll need to let it dry. Read your bottle of fabric paint and the hot-glue instructions for specific times. The glue itself may dry in around a minute, but fabric paint may take up to 72 hours to dry, depending on the brand., Once your mask has dried, go ahead and try it on. Pair it with a homemade Spiderman costume, or wear it on its own. It'll be perfect for Halloween, Super Hero events, or costume parties.	Get a red spandex mask. Buy a pair of large-frame sunglasses. Use window tint for the eyes. Buy a black Sharpie, black fabric paint or puff paint. Get a hot glue gun. Lay your mask out flat. Sketch out the eyes. Cut out the mask's eyes. Take out the sunglasses' lenses. Hot glue the lenses inside the mask. Draw the eye borders. Draw on webs. Let it dry. Try it on.
There aren't any hard and fast rules when it comes to knitting needle requirements for working with certain types of yarn. Choose a yarn that you enjoy and realize that chunkier yarns will knit up faster than thin or fine yarn. The same is true of your needles. If you'd like a larger looser blanket, work on larger needles.   Consider using size 19 US or 15.0 mm needles and super chunky yarn to create a large blanket that comes together quickly.; , Find the end of your yarn which is usually tucked into the middle of the ball of yarn. Make a loop near the end of the yarn as though you're going to tie a knot. The long end should be on top of the short end. Fold the top loop over to the inside of the loop. Pick up the loop and pull it through tightly. Slip this loop onto one of your knitting needles and pull the end to tighten it.          You'll know you've correctly made a slip knot if you can can simply continue pulling the loop and it comes apart.  Hold the needle with the slip knot in your right hand. Drape the working yarn over the palm of your left hand so your fingers can close into a loose fist and grab it. Wrap your thumb around the yarn so that it threads behind your thumb (if your palm is facing you). Use the point of your needle to thread underneath your thumb. Pull the needle through so that the yarn is lifted off your your thumb and onto your needle.  Cast on until you have 14 stitches on your needle. This will eventually be an edge of one of your patchwork squares. Each square will measure about 20cm (7.5 inches). Transfer the needle with the stitches to your left hand so you can begin knitting.Continue grasping the yarn in your palm with your fingertips, this will keep it out of the way and create tension so that you can quickly cast on.  Hold the needle that doesn't have any stitches on it in your right hand. Insert the tip of this needle into the stitch closest to the tip of the other needle.   You should insert it under the stitch so that the needle goes from front to back and forms an "X".  Grab the working yarn with your right hand and wrap it around the right needle so that it's in between the needles. Slowly pull the right needle down and through the yarn on the left needle.          You should keep the working yarn between the needles while you do this.  Your right needle should now be on top of the left needle. Pull this stitch off the left needle by lifting the right needle up and away from the left needle. This will transfer the stitch from the left needle to the right needle.         Try to work near the end of the needles so that the stitches don't become tight on the middle of the needles. But, make sure that they're not so close to the ends of the needles that the stitches fall off.  Knit each of the stitches that you cast on until you come to the end. This makes a complete row of garter stitches. Transfer the needle with the stitches to your left hand and continue knitting them to make another row. Knit rows until your square measures 20cm (7.5 inches).         Make sure you knit into the stitches that are looped onto the left needle, not the stitches of the row you just completed.  Keep the needle that has your knitted square in your left hand. Knit two stitches onto the empty needle in your right hand. You'll use these stitches to cast off the rest of the square that's on the other needle. You should always have two stitches on the right needle.Casting off or binding off will work the square off of the needles. This means you'll be able to take it off the needles without worrying that it will come undone. You'll be able to sew this square to another completed square when you assemble the blanket.  Push the tip of the left needle into the first stitch on your right needle. This should be the first stitch that you knit on this needle., Use the tip of the left needle to lift the first stitch over the second stitch. This means you'll be lifting the stitch and sliding it off of the right needle. You should now have only one stitch on the right needle.  You'll always need two stitches on the right needle so that you can lift up and over a stitch to cast it off. Continue casting off the stitches until you reach the end of the row.         You should have a completely empty needle and only one stitch still on the other needle.  Remove the needle from the last stitch. You should see a big loop. Hold onto this so that it doesn't come unraveled and use scissors to cut the working yarn. Leave about an arm's length of yarn when you cut it. Take the yarn and tie it through the loop, pulling it tightly.         You'll still have extra yarn tailing from the end of your square after you've tied it off. You'll use this to sew the squares together.  You can make the blanket as large as you like, keeping in mind that you'll need to knit more squares. For a large square blanket, you might want to use seven squares across by seven squares down.Consider laying out your squares on a large surface so you can arrange them, especially if you used different colored yarn. Alternate the squares so that the rows are vertical next to a square where the rows are turned horizontal.  Select the squares you'll be sewing together. Take a large sewing needle and thread the yarn from a square's tail. Adjust the square so that the square you're sewing it to is turned opposite.         For example, if the square with the sewing tail has rows arranged horizontally, the square you're sewing it to should be arranged vertically.  Take the threaded sewing needle and insert it into the stitch of the square that's laying next to it. Pull the needle so the yarn tightens. Insert the needle back into the square with the tail you're using. You should be stitching the two squares together by going back and forth with the yarn.         Continue doing this till you reach the end of the squares. The two squares should be completely sewn together now.  You'll be left with tails of yarn on your squares that you won't need to sew into other squares. Take your tail and thread it onto the needle. But, instead of using it to connect to another square, simply weave it in between the knots on one square's edge. Make a knot in the yarn and cut it off so that it doesn't come undone.         Weaving in the end can prevent a loose end from unraveling and can make your knitting look more polished.  Continue sewing together squares until you have seven squares in a row. Create seven of these rows total so you can stitch together every row and make a large blanket. Or, make a smaller blanket by using fewer squares. You can also make a rectangular blanket by making the rows shorter than the blanket is long.Consider adding beads and other decorative objects to your knitting. You could also just sew on the beads afterwards. Also consider adding knit flowers, leaves, or decorative edging.	Gather your yarn and knitting needles. Make a slip knot. Cast on a stitch. Continue casting on. Insert the right needle. Wrap the yarn around the needle. Complete the stitch. Continue knitting. Knit. Insert the left needle onto the right needle. Lift the stitch over. Knit another stitch and cast it off. Tie off the square. Knit more squares. Thread the yarn. Sew the edges of two squares together. Weave in the ends. Assemble your blanket.

These are the building blocks of your writing.; , One set of four quarter notes played correctly can be much more effective than three or four measures of complex material.  Often you'll find yourself in a haze of your own playing. Avoid these mistakes:   Forget. A long series of notes can be tricky to remember, especially when different rudiments are involved. Overplay. Remember that a drum line is only as good as its weakest drummer, and if he/she cannot keep up, the entire drum cadence is weakened Solo. This is flashy, fun, eye grabbing, and may reflect great skill, but often in solos, the tempo is lost and will sound horrible with the rest of the line. Save excessive showboating for I & E's.  Do eight or nine counts then stop. Repeat those counts three or four times. Then, if you like it, write it.  This is most likely your snare part.  Sometimes ripples are nice, or even dynamic quarters. Steady quarters are another option. Sometimes only the offbeat will give a funky sound to the line. It all depends.  paradiddles, flams, etc. These sometimes help dynamics on either hand or at different points. They are also more professional.  Yes, it may be boring sounding now, but your quads/quints are going to spice up even the simplest of cadences.  A general rule to follow is to make sure every accent on the snare and bass drums is hit by the quads on a different drum. For example, if the snare drum accents every other beat, make sure every other beat gets a different drum.  Use all manner of rudiments, accents, and even make chords with different drums. Even clapping and hands playing are effective.  Cymbals are much more than crashes and hi-hats. Sometimes even the most basic cymbal parts can add a completely different sound to your cadence. Ask a friend who plays cymbals about all the different sounds and techniques you can create with a pair of cymbals. You might be surprised.  Do not let one section overpower the rest of the line.  Emphasize them for every section.  Nobody's first song was awesome. All people who write music had to start somewhere. Mistakes and experimentation are how you learn; they're how music develops.	Have a basic knowledge of notes, time signature, rhythm, and pitch. Keep it simple. Put down the sticks. Tap out some quarter notes and say, (don't tap), a rhythm that pops into mind. Repeat last step until a fluent piece is written. Go through the cadence one measure at a time and think of a cool bassline. Go through both parts of the whole cadence and look for opportunities to work in rudiments, e.g. Go through once more and finalize those two parts. Begin the quints/quads part.

To make a coiled flower, you first need to create a strip that you will coil up and form into a flower. Start by making a chain of 30 stitches. This will be your foundation chain for the strip.To make the first chain, yarn over your hook twice and pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull it through the other loop. Keep doing this to continue making the chain.; , After you have made your chain, do a double crochet stitch into the first stitch in your chain.To double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook, and then insert the hook through the stitch and loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the first stitch, then loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches, and then yarn over again. Pull through the last two stitches to complete the stitch., For the next chain, double crochet twice into the same stitch. This will help to expand the strip so that the petals will fan out after you coil them., Keep going back and forth between double crocheting once and double crocheting twice all the way to the end of the row. When you reach the end, your strip is complete., To finish the strep and prepare it for coiling, cut the yarn several inches away from the last stitch. Then, pull the end of the yarn through to secure the stitch and tie the two ends together. Thread the ends through the eye of a darning needle., Starting with the end finished on, begin rolling the strip like a jelly roll. Roll the strip so that the edges stay even and the coil is tight, but not so tight that it is stretching the yarn. Keep coiling until you reach the end of the strip., After you finish coiling the strip, take the needle and insert it through multiple layers on the back side of the flower. This will be the side that does not fan out. It will look more like the base of a flower.Sew through all of the layers using several stitches and then tie off the yarn once the flower is secure. You can leave the excess thread if you plan to use it to attach the flower to something, or you can cut the excess thread if you do not plan to use it.  To add a finishing touch to your flower, you can sew some beads into the center. Or, you can also sew a decorative button into the center. This will make your flower look more flower-like and add a nice touch of shine or color., If you want to accent your flower even more, then try making a couple of crocheted leaves. You can sew these onto the edges of your coiled flower to make it look even more like a flower.  Use green yarn to make your leaves.  You can leave your coiled flower around as a decorative piece or you can attach it to something. Try sewing your flower onto a hat, sweater, or scarf. Or, you can use hot glue to attach the flower to something as well.	Chain 30. Double crochet one time in the first stitch. Do two double crochet stitches in second stitch. Continue this pattern to the end of the chain. Tie yarn ends together and thread through darning needle. Begin coiling the strip. Sew through the layers on the back side. Sew on some beads or a button. Make a couple of leaves for accents. Attach the flower with hot glue or yarn.
A slide is supposed to be a continuous sound. You pick the note, holding down your finger, then slide up or down the neck while you can still hear the first note. You should hear the pitch of the note move with your finger -- getting higher if you move towards your body and lower if you move away.          A slide is noted on a tab by a slash. Slides down are forward slashes (/) and slides up are backslashes (\). For example, a slide from the 3rd fret to the 5th, and then back, is noted by "3/5\3."; , Make sure you use your fingertips to fret, as they are more precise and harder than your fleshy finger pads. You need to hold the note down hard, but still lightly enough that you can slide down the string.          Start slow -- slide from one fret to the other, focus on keeping the note playing the whole time. Newer strings are always easier to slide on than older ones. Fresh strings are almost always worth it.  If you see a tab with a / before a fret, with no number before the slash, this means you just slide into the note from anywhere. In the above lick, you can slide into the third note for a classy, smooth entrance to the solo.  Slides to the 3rd note or the flat 5th note are often the most bluesy places you can start moving. By "3rd note," this means the 3rd note in your pentatonic scale. The flat 5th is the blues note located between the 3rd and 4th notes in the pentatonic scale. The notes are bolded below, in the key of A.          e|---------------------5-8-9--------------| B|--------------------5-8----------------- G|----------------5-7-8-------------------| D|---------5-7----------------------------| A|-----5-6-7-----------------------------| E|-5-8------------------------------------|  , You can slide power chords, single notes, or even double note sets. Try, for example, sliding the 3rd fret on the bottom two strings (the thinnest ones), down to the 4th fret and back up. This little slide fits nicely in the key of E-blues, and you should get used to little slides down here for bluesy accent notes.	Fret a note, play it, and slide to another fret without picking up your fingers. Keep your finger pressing down hard against the string for the entire slide. Slide into notes for a smooth start to a solo. Aim for slides on your 3rd and flat 5th notes for extra bluesy playing. Know that you can slide across multiple strings.

At the beginning of each show after a fly-in effect of a question that related to general knowledge (but had nothing to do with the show in question) but that could have either been short-answer or multiple choice, the narrator said "If you could answer this and a bunch of other questions, maybe you've got what it takes to..." and the viewer could here the audience scream "Make the Grade" as you saw the show logo fly onto the screen. The show music would then begin - most viewers and fans remember this music - even to this day. The narrator would come back a few seconds after the show's icon would randomly change colors and flash these differences every few milliseconds (then quickly fly off the screen and disappear) and with a quick rhetoric referring to the introduction of the host (something along the lines of "And here's with your space-age host and didn't ever tell a joke that you didn't like...") and introduced the host's name. The host would walk across the screen until he arrived behind his own podium on-set and stood before the contestants. The host would most-often thank the narrator and welcome all the contestants to the game, then explain the episode's game board and rules and the game would begin.     ; , This game had a few rounds that you had to get through, that will be described below., Players competed on answering questions, based on the game board that is described in a subsequent step. Players had to complete a game board so that each player had to solve one question in each grade level as well as one question in each category, and while that seemed too simple to accomplish, with the possibility of three teams vying for the same space, this seemed quite complicated. The first team to do so won the game and the right to advance to the Honors round, as well as a monetary gain of $500 and the same pair of British Knights sneakers (the losers would also be given). It was tracked on the players game board in front of them and (as you'll see later), lights lit up on the board as the questions were answered. If no player finished their game board, the player with the most question lights on their game boards won the game and was chosen to advance to the Honors round.  Losers of the Question round got $50 for their appearance on the show as well as a free pair of British Knights sneakers to take home with them.  This round was a final Grand Prize round that resulted in more cash and in the second and third season(described below) a trip right back to Universal Studios (now called Universal Studios Orlando). At first, players had to choose a category out of three possible choices: In one specific situation, you could have been presented with Dogs, Cats or Mice (just as an example) and each question that you answered from the set of 7 questions from seven categories relating to that top-level category still led you to money. Generally, these seven questions generally related back to the same seven categories the player would have seen from the day's Question round. Each correct answer was worth $100, though once you answered question 7 right, you won the Grand Prize of a total of $1000 or the trip (dependent on season). Players could pass on a question and more often rarely got back to trying again - otherwise if answered incorrectly, they were told they were wrong but were unable to answer again and could never win the bonus question. The player was given 45 seconds to answer all seven questions., During the second and third season, this game was more often a space filler than any real part of the process in the game. Players were given several more questions which didn't really have any real category to them. More often the contestant was rather easily able to answer them. The contestant was given a question at a low dollar amount at first. If they answered the question correctly, they were given this money at the end, and they could choose to go onwards to the next question. If the next question was answered correctly, they could go onwards yet again and so on. There were questions for winnings of $50, $100, $200, $500 and $1000; players had to begin at the beginning and work their way up to the $1000. . However, miss a question or ask to pass and you end up loosing the University Round and only walk out with the money from the Question and Honors rounds with no money from the University round., Other season space fillers included (first season) the host (as you'll see later) Lew Schneider traveling to malls and asking random mall walkers questions for minimal money while on the third season the host would walk out into the audience and begin asking random people questions for T-shirts and other random small prizes. If the game was won way too early and the University Round couldn't cover it without even more time, a second game had to begin but was played in abbreviated time. However, playing an abbreviated game as a tie-in at the end was super-rare., The beginning question was answered and in a two sentence summary, a summary was given to answer it. The credits then rolled and the game concluded with the credits and such rolling onscreen., Contestants drew from a mechanical split-flap game board that had a total of 49 squares on it. It was 7 squares vertical by 7 squares horizontal. Each of these boards had seven categories to choose from (from the vertical direction) and several "grade levels" (going horizontally). It was operated mechanically and everytime a player asked to see what was behind this door (whether it be a question the players had to answer, a challenge (that you'll learn about in an upcoming step) that this show called a "Fire Drill", take a square or loose a square space), the home viewer could hear the clicking of the doors as they were opened and closed. You couldn't see the wires, but you could tell that this wasn't something that was technological in design (as many other Nickelodeon TV game shows could tout.)  Players could pick from several categories. Most often this consisted of art or science or social studies or math or however, along with one "special elective" that rarely ever fit into other categories on the board. Along the top, they had several grade levels consisting of Elementary as well as grade levels between 7th and 12th grade.  Sometimes players even picked squares that had already been revealed and had to be either told that it was already chosen by another team or if it led to a loose a square space that was already revealed, tended not to change and the action was taken yet again - thereby making players even that much more depressed at their actions.   As a player, you could run into several types of squares and square designations. They had squares for each team's colors, along with squares marked with a question mark (for when the host had to ask the teams to answer a question), Take (for when the team could take a square of another team's color as their own) or Loose (when a team would lose their color-denoted square) as well as black squares which were designations of squares that were answered by all teams but were answered incorrectly. There was a Free square which could help a team take another square without being penalized or having to answer a question, but these were rather rare (especially in the second and third season). had denoted squares that had been lost from the Loose-a-Square space elsewhere on the board.  Fire drills were similar to Physical Challenges (but without the messiness) on Nickelodeon's Double Dare. Almost most were physical, they involved all three players partaking in challenges. Although it seemed like games never crossed between one episode and another, one fan could notice that the directions of using a fake hammer to toss a stuffed rat" onto a toy that looked like an enlarged mousetrap until the trap snapped onto the mouse. Generally, the winners of these contests got their choice of what color spot they'd like to return to and most often the winner chose to move to the team with the highest other square. These changes were cheesy and could sometimes mean a big win for a team even if the move only lasted a few minutes., The set was comprised of several items. Although it seemed like the shots were taken in a cubed room that was tilted at an angle, there were several items in this room.  The game board was at the top-most corner, but was tilted at an angle so that the players could easily read it. Closer to the audience but away from the players (if an imaginary line was drawn) was the host and host's podium (a cylindrical stand that was yellow in color with colored paint blotches). Across from the game board in the top right corner and off to the players' right were the location of the Fire Drills. The viewer and fan could tell that this was the corner when you saw almost equal podiums in this corner when the camera was changed so the players were shown getting up from their desks and walking to the Fire Drill location. Across the alleyway from the host's desk, you could see the contestant desk areas. One main thing that stood out was the light board for each team and below it and expanded over all three desks was a yellow banner with the show insignia on it. You could tell the light board was there and how it was set up when you saw a square-like light board with one row of lights for the categories and one row of all the grade levels (as was described previously). Each desk looked like an enlarged student desk from a school with that special game board in front of it where you'd generally see the student's knees, legs and feet. Behind that, sometimes you could see the player's selection buttons and desk, but these times were varied, but sometimes you could tell when the players were moving to get to the FIre Drill location in the studio set. Behind this even still, you'd find the player sitting on their stools which at times looked like even more like the podiums used for the host desk and Fire Drill holding place, while at other times in other seasons looked like the chairs like a student desk without the cross bar attaching it to the desk portion - these were freely movable but didn't seem to have rollers. They were steady, but you could tell there was some space in between them but were firm and were unmovable.  On Make the Grade, there were three teams. They each wore one color, that was either red, green or blue. In later episodes, green was changed to yellow., Players generally were seen wearing yellow t-shirts (no matter what team color they were on) with the show logo (described later in this article) across the player's chest on the shirt. In the first season, the show logo was more centered across the entire shirt and the contestants baby-blue/light-blue like colored index card-like nametag in the player's shirtpocket-like corner. In the second season, the show logo became more pronounced in the corner and the yellow-colored (that sometimes even matched the color of the shirt) nametag would be worn on the opposite side of the shirt.  The host however, never wore any certain same shirt. He'd wear something more casual and most often could be seen wearing a sweater or sweatshirt on the set. TV viewers could rarely see what the contestants wore as far as their pants or shoes, so this article can't vouch for these details. However, most often contestants on a Nickelodeon game show were given sneakers (brand logo information omitted) upon the rights to use brand marketing as advertisements at the end of the show.  The show's icon was rather whimsical. Although the elliptical format of the logo with the weird writing that had some letters in all caps, the logo extended in all the corners into what made the logo appear to be some spaceship-like logo., During the first season, Lew Schneider hosted the show. This was Lew's first real acting job as the host of a show. However, Lew went on to host, produce and direct other shows including some of the 1999 season of Everybody Loves Raymond (among others) and is currently the producer of the hit TV show The Goldbergs.On the other hand, during the second season, they replaced Lew and brought in Robb Edward Morris who, much like Lew, had his initial appearance on Make the Grade which brought him fame, but who hasn't had a decent time with other roles, having last acted in 2016 on the show "Aquarius" but having two upcoming roles in two TV shows in 2017., During the entire run of the show, this show had an announcer named Maria Milito. This was Maria's one and only acting-announcing job and has no other upcoming gigs., This show aired between October 2, 1989 and December 29, 1991 on Nickelodeon for a total of 160 episodes over the course of three seasons (Fall-Winter 1989, Spring 1990 and Fall-Winter 1990).These episodes were re-released in syndication as reruns on the Nick Gas channel (between January 2,2000 and April 2,2004) until that too was dropped (when the station went belly-up and couldn't make a comeback). Each episode lasted about 23 or 24 minutes, but along with advertisements, this show was shown during a half-hour block of time once or twice a week over the course of a weekend schedule.

If you’re in a town where there are a lot of burlesque shows, then you will want to think of how your show can be different from the rest of the pack. A themed burlesque show or a variety show, are the two most frequently developed types of shows. New York’s current themed Burlesque shows include: Cosplay Burlesque (a burlesque show that included performers dressing up as various anime characters), D20 Burlesque (a monthly burlesque show that uses board games as the theme), David Lynch Burlesque (David Lynch films are the theme of this monthly burlesque show), Hyper gender Burlesque (Summer, 1,001 Arabian Nights, Cornucopia, and Freedom have all been the subject of this unique monthly burlesque show where both theme and cast change monthly). Nothing is off limits in terms of themes: Storybook Burlesque and Book Club Burlesque both use books as their subject matter.   The concept of a variety show is no longer a novelty in itself, with more and more burlesque performers studying skills like fire eating, glass walking, sword swallowing, and contortion these performers instantly add a touch of variety to any show they are booked in. Many producers will also hire magicians, comedians, or drag artist who can double as host and performer. Spice! an evening of variety recently returned to the New York nightlife scene with a complete redesign. Producers opted to scrap the original format of burlesque, sideshow, comedy for a historical theme, in which all acts are connected by a story line. Scripted shows involve group rehearsals, which in itself create an added cost for a production. For your first production it is best to start small (including budget size), but whatever the concept of your show, make it something you love.; , Is this a one hour show with intermission? Is it an all night 4 hour affair? Look around at other burlesque shows and see what the popular production length is. If most shows in your town are only one hour, then that could be because other producers have already figured out that audiences are only willing to commit an hour to burlesque entertainment. That doesn’t mean your show has to be an hour. You may decide you want to be the producer offering what is not currently available in your town, and then proceed in producing a 2 hour or 4 hour event.  Unless you own a bar or theater, you’ll need a place to put on the show. Start your search by looking at venues that already house burlesque events. If you see multiple burlesque shows at the same venue, then there’s a good chance the venue has a following for the burlesque scene and that other producers will be happy to know you are looking to bring something to the same venue. If all the shows seem to be from just one producer, you may want to contact that producer to find out they’re experience with the venue. This is not mandatory. Unless that producer owns the venue, you can proceed with contacting the venue and asking for a performance date. Being a bit old fashioned, I think it’s always fun to meet your neighbor. They may be able to help you with something down the road and if they become competition it’s good to know who you are competing against. Remember step 2. Guess what? Where your show will be may influence how long the show will be. If the bar only books acts that are 1 hour, then if you want to use that bar you will have to offer them a 1 hour show. Why do I suggest picking show length before venue? Because if you are truly set on that 4 hour event, then you’ll know what venues to pass up while you are searching for the best performance spot.  Okay, so you know what kind of show your will do, how long it will be, and where you will do it, unless you are doing a solo (if so then skip to step 5), you’ll need other performers. Do you have friends that are also looking for more stage time and would be interested in your theme? If not, put the word out to other performers asking them to join your show. 10 performers in 1 hour is probably too many.   To figure out how many performers are needed you’ll want to look at: the average length of the routine + the amount of time necessary for setup/ clean up= X then... X divided by,(the length of the show – intermission)= approximate number of acts. So for example if I have a 1 hour show and I want each routine to be between 3-5 minutes, and I figure some people will leave lots of clothes on stage and some will have lots of set up, then I’m adding an extra 5 minutes for setup/cleanup. 5 minutes + 5 minutes= 10 minutes, then 10 minutes / (60 minutes- 10 minute intermission) = 5 acts needed. I know that I will want to book at least 5 acts to fill my 1 hour show, if I decide to perform as well, then I might only need 4 more performers to fill up the evening or I might add myself as a 6th performer. This way, if most of the routines are closer to 3 minutes with zero cleanup, at least I don’t have to worry about the show wrapping up too early.  You have the ideal show, the ideal venue, and you are about ready to find the ideal cast. Before you start booking know what kind of money you do or don’t have. Is the venue charging you for space (room rental fee, portion of ticket sales, bar guarantee), if they are, then you’ll want to think about how you plan on covering that cost. Next think about who is doing sound, who is hosting, and who is doing setup/ cleanup (the stage kitten). Do you know someone who can do at least one of those things for free? Do you want to guarantee that the dancers make money? If so, how much? If you are already over budget, maybe think about bringing in fewer performers but asking them to bring 2 routines.   If you hire 2 performers other than yourself, then you still have 6 acts (2 performers + 1 you, multiplied by 2 acts each), but for a lot less money. Now add up the money you need to cover all expenses and divide that be half the available seats in the venue or average audience size. The more you produce the more you will work with “average audience size” in your budgets. For now you can just look around at shows you’ve been to in your town. In New York, there are so many shows every day of the week, that 20 is not an unreasonable average audience size. So if you have a room rental fee of $200 for 1 hour. That's Space $200 + $0 for your boyfriend the DJ + $0 for the stage kitten who is new to burlesque and is doing me a favor + $25 for your friend the comedian who will host + $75 guarantee for the 3 dancers including you = $300 for your show, not including marketing cost. Then $300/ 20= $15 ticket price per person. Once you know the minimum you need to make, adjust your ticket price according to what local shows cost and what your customer would be comfortable paying. If the other burlesque shows in you area charge $5 you will not be able to easily sell tickets for $15 unless you can show you are providing something that is worth the extra cost.  You’ll want to use as many sources of free marketing and advertising that’s available to you. Maybe a friend can design a postcard. Submitting the event to your local newspaper is free. Creating a Facebook event page is free. Emailing all your friends is also free. If your budget allows you’ll want to make money available for postcard or flyer printing, and the occasional paid ad, but remember to keep things simple for your first show. If you like producing, then it won’t be long before you’ll be creating bigger budgets and rhinestone filled dreams.	Think of a concept for your show. Decide on the length of the event. Select a performance venue. Cast your show. Create a budget!, Once you’ve worked out if you can afford to produce your dream then book the venue, book the performers, and start promoting!
; , For example, on weekends you could do more than an hour, like two or three, or even more. This is very helpful because it pulls you out of the routine of piano playing, and lets you practice more and perfect the pieces you play.  For example, if you are taking piano lessons and are about to play a new piece, you could try searching on the internet for videos or songs and hear how it sounds. This can be very helpful because it teaches you how a song is played and lets you recognize the 'emotion,' the piece is giving off.  For example, if the piece starts with an 'mp' (mezzo-piano) it only means 'moderately soft' these dynamics don't have specific volume levels. If you are practicing, you don't need to play accordingly and then have a difficulty hearing yourself, you should only play as it tells you when you are actually trying to play it properly.  This can be very helpful, because it's almost like scanning a paragraph and looking at the picture. It helps you to understand what the passage is trying to convey before you actually read it and lets you know what comes next. This is the same with music, and it can help you stop making mistakes.  Don't look at them as a burden, but instead as a pat on the arm informing you of avoiding that the next time.  For example, if the time signature is 3/4, then count the notes in each bar as you play. This can be helpful because it helps you judge how quickly or slowly a note should be played, but you don't need to count in the piece after you have played it well.  This can be challenging at first, as some people are shy or lack confidence. But this helps with your playing, and you will become more confident about playing in front of people.  For example, a much more advanced pianist or a piano teacher can be a lot of help. When they play something, it makes you understand how the piece should be played, therefore helping you play it better.  Many people feel that they are excellent when they're playing the piano alone but not nearly as good when playing in front of others. Try not to play too fast or too slow to impress people, even if no one's there. Maintaining a more comfortable tempo helps you concentrate on not making mistakes. When you have become comfortable with the piece at that tempo, you can speed up or slow down depending on the piece.	Try practicing about an hour a day, or half an hour if you have a busy schedule or can't find time. Do extra practice whenever you have more time. Listen to the song or piano piece you are playing. Try not to look at the dynamics in a piece, as rules you cannot break. Practice sight-reading and don't worry about making mistakes. Pay close attention to your mistakes. Count as you play during practice according to the time signature. Play in front of friends and family. Ask someone to play the piece you are practicing for you. Concentrate on playing the piece properly.
Fill a large bucket or sink with cool to room temperature water. Immerse the leather in the water for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes thoroughly soaked.   Note that this process works best when used with vegetable tanned leather. You can technically stiffen the leather by soaking it in nothing but room temperature water, but it will only become mildly harder and you will not be able to shape it. The addition of a hot water step will allow you to make structural changes while hardening the leather further.; , As your leather soaks, fill a large stockpot with water and set it on the stove over high heat. Continue heating the water until it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).Use an accurate thermometer to keep track of the temperature. If the water is too hot or too cold, your results can vary dramatically from those described here. If you do not have a thermometer, you can gauge the temperature of the water by slowly heating it on the stove and testing it every minute or so with your bare hand. If you can keep your hand immersed in the water, it is safe to use that temperature for your leather. Once you can no longer bear to keep your hand in the water for more than an instant, remove the water from the heat source and do not allow it to get any hotter. Some people prefer to soak the leather in boiling water. Doing so stiffens the leather at a faster pace, but it also gives you less control. The resulting leather can become very brittle and may be unevenly stiff across its surface.  Pull the leather out of the cool water and immerse it in the hot water. Let it remain there for a few minutes.   After the first minute, you should already see the leather darken and curl. The longer you soak the leather, the stiffer it will become. If you soak the leather too long, however, it will be more brittle when dry. When using this method, soaking the leather in hot water for 30 seconds after it already darkens will result in a piece of leather that is hard but not inflexible. This means that the total hot water soak time would be about 90 seconds. Leave the leather in the water for a longer period of time if you want to make it stiffer.  When you pull the leather out of the water, it should be fairly flexible. If you need the form the leather into a specific shape, now is the time to do so.   When wet, the leather will be stretchy and easy to form. This stretchiness will vanish within the first minute or two, though, so you need to work fast if you plan to stretch it out. The leather will still remain flexible for up to an hour after the stretchiness fades away, though.  Let the leather sit out at room temperature for several hours. After it dries, the leather should be notably thicker and stiffer.   Stiffened leather will also shrink, so the piece you started out with may not look as large when you finish the process.	Soak the leather in cool water. Heat a second pot of water. Dunk the leather in the hot water. Shape as desired. Allow the leather to dry at room temperature.
You can do so by looking at some pictures of Yuuki and sewing it yourself. If you aren't keen on sewing, ask a friend or family member who is proficient in the skill to make the costume for you. You can also buy it online at a cosplay shop. If you want to cosplay Yuuki in her academy dress, her multiple artwork dresses, or her winter cloak, buy it or sew it after seeing reference pictures. Remember that she likes to dress in soft pastel colors.; , Yuuki is seen wearing a necklace with the crest of her school. Also, she wears a small metal bracelet that allows her to control Zero. You might also want to get her staff/scythe, Artemis. Otherwise, she is seen with detailed jewelry and clothing in several artworks.  Have medium-length, brown hair or get a wig. Unless you want to cosplay Yuuki as a vampire, then you need long brown hair down to your lower back. You can also buy a wig for that as well. Remember that she likes to wear cute "Alice bands" in her hair, mostly in pastel colors.  If you have very large breasts, you may want to bind them but it's not really necessary. You could use thin cloth to bind. Don't use bulky cloth because that would make it obvious.  If you have brown eyes, no need to wear burgundy contacts, but you might like it, though, since her eyes are more reddish brown. To emphasize eyes, wear MAKEUP! Yuuki is a bit of a tomboy, so she's not the type to wear a full face of makeup, but to get those big anime/manga eyes, wear black or brown eyeliner in a anime/manga shape on the upper and lower lash-line, some mascara, and false lashes if you are up to it. Use pictures of Yuuki online for ideas.  Also, you might like to hang with some Yori or Kaien cosplayers, the people dear to Yuuki. As Yuuki is a very social and talkative person, cos-playing with some others will let you look more like her.  Yuuki is very naive, comedic, and optimistic, but also very indecisive. Learn about her character and her traits, like being not able to cook something eatable or enjoying parfait.  Yuuki is known for her kindness and caring nature toward everybody, especially her friends.  Yuuki's is from time to time fairly insecure due to her missing past so it may help to act this way but don't overdo it. If your going more for vampire Yuuki then don't act indecisive or insecure for that she looses this trait later. Also, be more authoritative. ,	Make or buy a Cross Academy day class or night class uniform (in the latest chapters, she finally got a night class uniform). Get the jewelry. Attain Yuuki's hair. Yuuki has an average-sized chest. Wear burgundy hued contact lenses if you don't have brown eyes. Have somebody cosplay as Zero or Kaname and hang around them. Be cheerful, kind, and act slightly air-headed. Smile and be nice to people. Be a little indecisive. Have a strong attachment with your close friends.  , Yuuki is super protective over Zero, so if you have someone you're extremely close to, exhibit protectiveness over this person.
Install motion-sensing lights by your driveway, garage, back door, and/or your front door. These lights will turn on when motion is detected, helping to deter approaching criminals. When choosing your lights, read the outside of the box to see what is involved in installing the lights. Install them per the instructions. It is recommended that you install passive infrared lights, low pressure sodium-vapor lights, or floodlights to deter criminals. You can purchase these at your local hardware store.; , Keep the trees and shrubs near your windows and doors trimmed. This will prevent burglars from being able to hide and launch an attack on your house., Place the decal next to the front door, or place it on a window facing the street. You can also place it next to your mailbox, or along the walkway leading up to your front door. Alarm decals will make criminals second guess their decision to break into your home.If you do not have an alarm decal, then display a “beware of dog” or community watch decal in your front yard instead.  Store bicycles, lawnmowers, snow blowers, and other expensive pieces of equipment in your garage or a locked shed. Also make sure to store your barbecue grill inside your garage, or somewhere in your backyard that is out of sight., Unless you are actively using it, make sure to keep your garage doors locked at all times. Do this even when you are inside the house, especially if your garage is attached to your house.If you have a shed, make sure to keep it locked as well.	Install motion-sensing lighting. Trim your trees and shrubs regularly. Place a home alarm system decal prominently. Store outdoor equipment out of sight. Keep your garage doors locked.
The materials needed are light and easy, though you may have some questions about how much you actually need:   About 2lbs of rope chord, cut into two roughly even halves (roughly 200 ft) 2-3 completely flat, 1/8" thick weaving shuttles, (various lengths) 1" thick wooden spacer, same length as chair 1/2" thick wooden spacer, same length as chair Very thin wooden spacer, same length as chair (a yardstick works well) Crochet hooks (for detailing); , You can start on any one of the four sides of the seat. Tie your knot and slide it all the way to one corner -- this is the starting point of your warp. A "warp" is simply the first round of rope, pointing in one direction, that gives the weave its shape.You should have the majority of your rope at the other end of this knot. Just keep it attached to the large ball of yarn/rope it came from. Click here to learn how to tie a clove hitch below.  This spacer will keep some slack in the weave as you start in the first direction. This will make it much, much easier to weave in the opposite side later. If you make this first weave too tight you will have to remove it and start over.  Take your rope and lay it over the spacer, over the opposite seat pole, then back underneath everything to your starting point. This is one loop.   You don't want to pull this as tight as possible. It should be tight enough to hold its shape, but not so tight you can't lift it slightly with your fingers.  Starting with the pole you tied the knot on, lay the rope over the spacer, over the opposite pole, then back under everything to where you started. Use your fingers to push the strings close together, then repeat until you have 5 total wraps.  Instead of wrapping across the whole width of the chair, wrap it the rope once around the pole opposite your starting side.  Come back to the beginning and wrap the rope just around this horizontal seat pole.  If you started on the left side of the seat, slide everything to the left. You should have a total of 6 parallel strings on the seat posts:   The string wrapped for your clove hitch. The five (5) strings woven across to the other side. The string wrapped around the pole to create a spacer.  This process simply continues until you've finished one side of the chair. To repeat:Wrap the string across the width of the chair, going over the spacer, around the far pole, and back to where you started. Repeat wrap for a total of five times. Wrap around each pole individually to create a spacer. Repeat., Don't try and tie a knot between two ends of the rope and keep going. If you're running out of rope/yarn/etc, simply finish the set of 5 you are on and create your two spacers. Tie the second spacer in, then create a clove hitch with a new strand of rope and "start over" from this point.  Once you get to the end of the seat pole, snip the rope so you have a 2-3" tail. Use your crochet hooks to tuck this strand into your warp, preventing it from unraveling, then snip any excess string., Shuttles are simply thin yarn holders that you can slide into your weave, making it much easier to get a tight weave than forcing your hands through the warp. Wrap up a small and a large shuttle, at minimum., Pick up the first five strings, and slide the spacer under it. Then slide the spacer on top of the next five strings, alternating so that you have a ladder-like pattern.  This time, your job will be easy as every other set is already being held up by the other spacer.   To get a little extra width, turn the spacers so that their widest side points upwards.  You'll be starting perpendicular to your first set of weaves, but it doesn't matter which side you start on.  You're doing the same thing as before, just keeping the string between your first set of weaves. This will help create the checkerboard pattern you're looking for.  Again, this is identical to the work from before -- you create another spacer on each side of the chair every five times you wrap around the width.  You should already see how the weave is forming small squares. As you work, you'll likely need to switch to smaller and smaller shuttles in order to fit under the weave, and you may have to switch to using just the thinner, 1/2" spacer or yardstick instead of both at once.   If you run out or rope, don't worry about tying another knot. Simply  , This takes time, but the precision is necessary for the final bits of the weave. Simply pull the rope through, using the crochet hook to get into the center and pull the rope up and down every five strings., Once you've finished the weave, it should hold strongly on its own. Your woven chair is done!, The weave goes perpendicular to the pole where you tie this knot., You should have a single strand of rope wrapped around your pole.  Make sure you do this loosely, so you could still get underneath the rope. You'll still have the rope wrapped around the pole, with crisscrossing ropes on top.  Again, come under and around the pole.  Basically, you're making another crisscross of the ropes but, this time, you need to go under the line. Note that this is under the second wrap you made, not the first one.  Hold onto the end of the rope, then pull hard on the rest of the line to tighten your knot.	Gather rope, shuttles, spacers, and a crochet hook, from a local craft store. Tie the first half of your rope to one of the horizontal seat poles using a clove hitch. Lay the 1" spacer across the seat, perpendicular to your knot. Wrap the rope around the whole width of the chair, then back to your starting point. Keeping the strings from overlapping, wrap the rope around everything four more times. After wrapping five times, individually wrap the seat pole to create a spacer. Run the rope to the other side and wrap the first seat pole once to create a second spacer. Slide the strings close together, making sure they don't crisscross. Repeat the process of five horizontal wraps and one spacer until you cover the whole chair. Tie a new clove hitch instead right after creating a spacer if you run out of rope and need to add more. Use a crochet hook to weave any stray strands back into the weave. Wrap the remainder of your rope onto your shuttles. Work your large spacer into warp, passing it over every other group of five strings. Turn the seat upside-down and repeat the step above with your other spacer, lifting the other sets of five strings. Starting with the rope on the larger shuttle, tie the rope down to a seat pole with another clove hitch. Using the shuttle to slide under the lifted strings, wrap the rope around the width of the chair five times. Wrap up the seat poles after five rounds to create spacers. Follow the same pattern as above -- five wraps, one spacer -- by sliding the shuttle underneath the lifted strings. Use the crochet hook to manually weave the final few strands, as the weave is likely too tight for the shuttles. Use scissors to clean up any loose threads, strands, and tails. Lay the end of the rope over the top of your pole (the edge of the seat). Pull the end under the pole and wrap it back around. Cross the end of the rope over the standing line wrapped around the pole. Tuck the end back under the pole as if double wrapping it. Slide the end underneath the loop you just made. Pull tightly on both ends of the rope to tighten it.
This collage is a good one after you've been hiking or walking in natural areas and you've collected things you found along the way. Suitable items include:   Seashells, broken and whole; carapaces of insects Flowers (these can be pressed and then used) Dried grasses Leaves Seeds and nuts, coconut shell ' straw, and others,etc.  If not, they may rot or go mildewy on the collage.  Paper, smooth bark, cardstock, recycled cardboard, etc. are all good choices for the background.  Perhaps you'd like to make a nature scene, such as arranging dried flowers as they'd appear in nature, or a clump of dried grasses. Or, maybe make a landscape or seascape using the items.  Use clear-drying craft glue. Double check that the items are actually sticking to the background.   If you want to preserve plant material used in a collage, make a "glaze". Dilute PVA glue with a little water. Brush this over the whole of the paper; this glazes the paper. Arrange the plant material on the glazed paper. Brush over all of the plant material with the same glaze. You must cover every possible bit of the plant material. Once fully dried, the glaze will protect the plant material for years and the effect will leave the collage shiny. Note that this can damage more delicate plant material, so be careful.  Place the collage on display or take photos of it and share online.	Find suitable items out in nature. Make sure that the items are dry before using them. Choose a suitable background. Design the collage. Glue the items in place. Allow to dry.
Also, you will need to consider the plant size as you may need to use multiple watering devices per potted plant or planted area.   Add up the number of potted plants versus in-ground plants that will need attention. If you need a self-watering device for in-ground plants, you may want to consider using a plastic instead of glass bottle for safety reasons.      ; , It’s very important to clean the hot sauce bottle thoroughly as you don’t want any spicy juice to get into the soil.   Pop off the top (the top that allows the hot sauce to slowly leak from the bottle) and fill the bottle with hot soapy water. Rinse and allow to dry.       Consider removing the bottle label so it doesn’t soak into the soil while the hot sauce bottle is doing its job.  If you want to feed your plants while they are being watered, add a small amount of plant food to the bottle first, then add the water. Replace the pop top lid and shake.  The bottle should be placed near enough to the plant so the water can seep down to the roots, but not so close so that it damages the plant.  Plunge the bottle into the soil, while at the same time removing your finger.	Identify plants that must be watered/cared for while you are away. Empty and clean out a hot sauce bottle. Fill the bottle with water. Identify an area near the plant to place the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down, while plugging the opening with your finger. Finished.
When you're growing a plant from a seed, it can help to germinate the seed first, because this will increase the chances of it taking root in the ground.   Place the seeds in a small bowl and fill it with warm water. Let the seeds sit in the water for 24 hours.After 24 hours, drain the water. On each seed, use your nail to gently pick away a small portion of the seed covering. Note that wisteria should be planted outdoors in the spring or fall, so make sure you start the germination process about six weeks before you want to transplant it outside.; , Fill a seed starter most of the way with potting soil and place one or two wisteria seeds on top of the soil in each pod. Make sure the seeds are on their sides. Cover them with one-quarter inch of potting soil.Place the seed trays in a warm, bright room. Add some water to the soil, and keep it moist for the duration of the sprouting time.  Keep the seeds warm and moist while they germinate, and give them lots of natural light. The seeds should sprout within 10 to 30 days.   Before you can transplant the sprouts, make sure they are at least four to five inches tall, and have a couple leaves on each stalk., A cutting is a root, leaf, shoot, or bud that gets trimmed off an established plant to propagate a new plant of the same kind. To do this, you will need an established wisteria plant to take the cutting from.If you don’t have an established plant to work with, ask friends or neighbors if they have a wisteria you can use.  For wisteria, you want to cut off a new shoot that still has soft green wood and that hasn’t yet developed bark. Make sure the shoot has a few sets of leaves on it (a couple on the top and a couple on the bottom).With a pair of sharp scissors or gardening snips, cut the shoot near the base. Make sure the cutting you take is about six inches long. You will have the highest chances of success if you do this at the end of spring or beginning of summer.  Snip off any leaves that are at the bottom of the cutting, leaving ones at the top intact. Then, snip off the bottom of the cutting at a 45-degree angle so there's only one-half inch (127 mm) of stem below the bottom leaf node that you cut. This will give the new roots somewhere to grow from and allow them to establish.For the best results, dip the end of the cutting into a rooting hormone before planting it., Place some rocks in the bottom of a small gardening pot to help with drainage. Fill the pot with potting soil that’s specifically designed for good drainage—look for a soil with a high perlite or coarse sand concentration. Add some water so the soil is moist. Make a two-inch (5 cm) deep hole in the soil with your finger and place the cutting in so the leaves are sticking up.Replace the soil and cover the bottom of the cutting where the roots will grow.  This will keep the soil moist and warm, and this will help the wisteria to take root. You can either wrap the entire pot in a plastic bag, or cover the top with a plastic bag or plastic wrap.Place the pot in an area where the plant will receive lots of indirect sunlight.  When the soil becomes dry to the touch, add water so it’s always moist. After about four to eight weeks, the cutting should take root.Since it’s best to plant wisteria in spring or fall, don’t plant the wisteria as soon as it begins to take root. Wait until fall to transplant it outside, or continue growing the new plant inside in pots until the following spring.  There are a few considerations when planting wisteria, including what the plant needs to survive and where it won’t cause damage. For instance:   The plant can grow quite large, so while it will grow nicely as a vine up a gazebo or pergola, this may not be a wise choice unless you're comfortable getting on a stepladder to prune the tree. Similarly, because wisteria is a climbing vine, avoid planting it near your house or any buildings, as eventually the plant can grow underneath siding, or ruin shutters and frames.Because wisteria grows so quickly and so heartily, plant it away from other plants, otherwise the wisteria might choke them out.Wisteria needs lots of sunlight to grow and bloom, so choose an area where the plant will get full sun exposure. The soil type doesn’t matter so much, but wisteria does need good drainage., The hole should be the depth of the roots and two to three times wider than the width of the roots.   If you're planting more than one wisteria, make sure the holes are at least 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) apart., When the hole is ready, carefully remove the seedling from the starter pod by tipping it upside down with one hand and cupping the plant with the other.   When the roots slide out of the pod, gently place the plant roots down into the hole. Add enough soil and compost to cover the roots, then water the plant. Allow the water to drain, then fill up the hole with soil and compost.Use your hands to press down the soil around the plant, and give it some more water., Mulch will help keep the soil around the plant moist, which is good for wisteria.   Each spring, add a layer of compost and a layer of mulch on top of the soil where the wisteria is., Wisteria is a heavy plant, and without the proper support, it will collapse under its own weight in the wind. You will need to provide support in the form of stakes if you didn’t plant your wisteria near to a wall or structure that will support it.   When the wisteria plant has established itself, insert a wooden stake six to 12 inches into the ground about one-half inch away from the stalk. Using twine, attach the wisteria stalk to the stake every eight inches., This is especially important in the first year. Wisteria needs the equivalent of one inch of water each week, so if you aren't getting enough precipitation, you will need to water as well.   Even if you are getting enough rain, you should still give the wisteria a soaking once a week.	Germinate the seeds. Plant the seeds in a seed starter. Allow the seeds to sprout. Find a plant to take a cutting from. Take a cutting. Prepare the cutting. Plant the cutting. Cover the pot with plastic. Water regularly. Choose the right location. Dig a hole. Transfer the seedling.

You can do some initial cleaning of your crystals with a toothbrush and water. Make sure you wash the crystals outdoors, as clay and dirt from the crystals can clog a sink.Scrub the crystal to remove set in clay. You will have to do several rounds of cleaning, allowing the crystals to dry in between rounds. Once the crystals dry, the clay cracks and becomes easier to remove. If clay is particularly stuck on, try spraying the crystals down with a hose with the nozzle set at maximum force. As with using a toothbrush, you will have to do this several times a day, allowing the crystals to dry in between sessions.; , Crystals may be stained with lime carbonates, calcite, and barite, causing discoloration. You can use vinegar and a household cleaner to remove these stains.Submerge the crystals in enough full-strength vinegar to cover all the crystals. Leave the crystals for 8 to 12 hours. Remove the crystals from the vinegar. Soak them in washing ammonium for an equal amount of time. Then, remove the crystals from the ammonium, rinse them completely, and wipe them dry. You may have to repeat this process several times if the stains persist after the crystals are first soaked.  There may still be some unwanted material on the quartz. You may also notice uneven edges. You can trim these materials using a diamond edged saw, which you can purchase at a local hardware store. Diamond edged saws can be expensive, however, so you may want to try borrowing the product from a friend or renting one.Lubricate the crystal with a light layer of mineral oil before you begin. There is no need to saw the crystal or press down on the saw. You simply need to place the crystal under the saw and allow the machine to gradually saw through the crystal. Trim away any unwanted portions of the crystal. There may be areas with stains that would not come out, for example, which you should remove with the saw.  The easiest and safest way to soak crystals to remove stains is using a combination of water and laundry detergent. You can then soak the crystals in bleach overnight. If your crystals have minimal stains, it's best to soak them overnight in a combination of water and household dish soap or laundry detergent.Use a combination of warm water and laundry detergent to wash the crystals. You can use a soft rag to scrub any dirt and debris that comes off easily. From here, find a container you can cover easily, like a sturdy Tupperware container. Fill this container with warm water and 1/4 cup of bleach. Place the gems in the bleach, cover the container, and set aside in a safe place for two days.  If your crystals have a lot of stains beyond regular dirt and grime, such as discolorations caused by iron, oxalic acid may be necessary to properly treat the gems. Oxalic acid is also known as wood bleach, and you can purchase it online or at a hardware store. Purchase a one pound bag of oxalic acid, and get a gallon container. Make sure the material the container is made out of will not corrode in response to acid. Metal containers cannot hold oxalic acid.Fill the container three fourths of the way full with distilled water. Then, pour in the oxalic acid. Wear an air mask to avoid inhaling the acid. You also want to make sure you work outside. Stir the acid, using a large rod or spoon, until the oxalic acid crystals are dissolved. Add the crystal quartz. There is no set time to soak quartz in oxalic acid. Depending on the staining, it can take a few days to a few hours. Check the quartz periodically and remove them when the stains are gone.  You need to take extreme precaution if you choose to handle oxalic acid. Only do so if your quartz are very stained. It is always safer to use bleach and water. If you choose to use oxalic acid, adhere to the following safety precautions:Wear eye protection, gloves, and a face mask when handling oxalic acid. Always pour acid into water. It is very dangerous to pour water into acid. Get a friend or family member to help you. Make sure to protect your work area and go slowly to avoid spills. Baking soda can neutralize acid spills, so have some baking soda on-hand.  Once you've soaked the crystals to remove the stains, you can now rinse the crystals. Make sure to use gloves for this process and, if you were working with oxalic acid, a face mask and eye protection. Wash away any excess bleach or acid with warm water. This should also help remove any remaining dirt., Once the crystals are clean and free of any stains, you should sand them down so they're soft and shiny. To do so, you'll need to gather certain materials. Stop by your local hardware store and pick up the following:50 grade sandpaper 150 grade sandpaper 300 to 600 grade sandpaper  , When sanding crystal, dust and powder may come off the gem. This can cause irritation of the nose, mouth, and eyes. Make sure you wear safety googles, gloves, and an air mask when polishing your quartz., To start, you'll want to use your mildest sandpaper. Gently work the sandpaper over the surface of the crystal.Make sure you go for consistency. You do not want any portions of the gem to be more or less sanded than others.  You'll want to work up to finer and finer grades of sand paper. Once you finish with the 50 grade sandpaper, rub the crystal down with 150 grade sandpaper. From there, move on to the 300 to 600 grade sand paper.Once again, rub the stone gently through its entire surface. Make sure to smooth away any blemishes or discolorations on the stone. When you're done, your crystal should like bright, clear, and shiny.  After sanding down the stone, you can use a soft cloth to give it an added gleam. Gently rub the stone clean with somewhat damp cloth. Get rid of any lingering dust from the sanding process, then set the stone aside to dry. You should have a clean, polished quartz crystal.	Use an old toothbrush to wash away clay or dirt. Soak the crystals in vinegar and washing ammonium to remove lime carbonates, calcite, and barite. Use a diamond edge saw to cut off excess material. Use water, household cleaners, and bleach. Try oxalic acid for harshly stained crystals. Be careful when handling acid. Rinse the crystals. Obtain the correct materials. Wear safety goggles, gloves, and an air mask. Work over the quartz with 50 grade sandpaper. Continue sanding the stone with 150 grade sandpaper, and then move on to the finest grade sand paper. Clean and rub the stone with a soft cloth.
If you only need a few buttons (less than 25) and you aren’t too worried about how professional they look, you can reuse old buttons. Find several in the size you want. They do not necessarily have to be the same size but if they aren’t, you’ll need to make different sized images.  You’ll need to create or otherwise get the image you intend to have on the button, sized correctly for the button diameter. Print out a sheet of these images on regular printer paper or photo paper if you’re feeling fancy.   Do test sheets on regular paper first, to make sure the image comes out the right size.  Cut out the image using sharp scissors, being as careful as you possibly can.  The best glue to use will be rubber cement. This is strong and creates a very flat appearance.	Find old buttons. Get your graphic. Cut out the image. Glue the image to the button.
Test gold with a magnet. Gold does not have magnetic properties. Test gold with a fine steel file. Gold is easy to file, but the file will bounce off of other metals. Purchase acids for testing. Follow the instructions on the package to test the gold for genuineness, testing in an inconspicuous spot to prevent visible damage.  You can find the daily market prices of gold on many brokerage websites.  You will need to purchase a jeweler’s scale that weighs gold according to pennyweight (1/12 of a troy ounce) rather than simply weighing gold in grams.  Many customers are happy to sell their gold jewelry and coins to a respectable dealer.  Many dealers at a trade show will give a price break to someone who is just getting started in the business.  Large volume purchases tend to have a lower price per ounce.	Learn to test the quality of gold. Follow market prices. Obtain a scale. Buy gold from customers. Purchase gold at trade shows. Purchase gold in large volumes.
If you’re under 18, you won’t be able to work as an actor without your parents’ permission, so it’s important to get them on board with your plans. Explain how much you enjoy acting, so they understand that it’s something you’re extremely passionate about. You may also need to reassure them that you won’t neglect your other responsibilities, such as school and chores, just because you’re pursuing acting.Don’t tell your parents that you want to become an actor just because you want to be famous or rich. Have some good reasons ready, such as you love telling stories or have fun creating characters, so they’ll take you seriously.; , While you may have natural talent, it always helps to hone your skills, so you’re well-prepared when you start to go on auditions. A school drama class is a good place to start, but specialized classes and workshops in specific acting areas, such as commercial acting or acting for the camera, are more impressive to list on your resume.If you don’t have time during the school year to take acting classes, a summer drama camp may be a good alternative. If you want personalized acting instruction, you might talk to your parents about hiring an acting coach who can work with you one-on-one to improve your skills.  While you probably won’t be able to get a professional acting job right out of the gate, you’ll want potential agents and casting directors to know that you have experience performing. Look for local opportunities to act (such as school plays, regional theater, and student films) so you have some roles to put on your resume.Try to play a large variety of types of roles. Doing so will it give you an opportunity to stretch your acting skills and will also showcase your impressive acting range to casting directors.  When you go to meet with potential agents and casting directors, you’ll need to provide a photo. They must be professional photos, though, so you should go to a photographer who specializes in taking photos of children and teens. Make sure to ask for both commercial and theatrical headshots, so you’re ready for both advertising work and film, television, and theater opportunities.It’s important to choose the right photographer for your headshots. Ask for recommendations if you have friends or acquaintances in the acting field. Otherwise, visit websites for photographers in your area, and study their online portfolios to get an idea of the quality of their work.  While you may be able to book some small acting jobs with just your parents’ help, having an agent is crucial if you really want to build a successful acting career. Not only will an agent know the ins and outs of the business so they can guide you in the right direction, they’ll have connections with casting directors and producers that make it easier to get auditions.To find an agent, research the top talent agencies in your area. You want to make sure that you’re working with a reputable agent, who doesn’t ask for any money upfront. Many talent agencies allow you to apply online. However, it’s a good idea to meet with a potential agent in person before you and your parents commit to working with them. If you live in a rural area where it's difficult to find an agent, that doesn't mean you can't act. It just means that you need to look for work through trade publications, such as Backstage, and online casting sites, so you can identify local acting opportunities. In some cases, agents won't take you on as a client until you have some professional acting credits to your name. You may want to find a few jobs on your own (or with your parents' help) before trying to land an agent.  If you’re under 18, many states require a permit to work in the entertainment industry. For example, California and New York, where many acting opportunities are available, have specific requirements that regulate how child actors may be used. Your agent should know the laws in your state, but you can also visit your state’s labor department website to find out if you need a permit in your state.In most cases, a form is required to get a work permit. You’ll need to provide parental consent, as well as other information depending on the state. Your health and school records are usually required.  While your agent will be on the lookout for acting opportunities that fit your skills, you can also do some research yourself. Sites such as Casting Frontier, Actors Access, and L.A. Casting provide casting and audition information for projects that are currently in the process of filling roles. You can usually submit yourself for consideration directly, but it’s a good idea to discuss potential roles with your agent.These sites usually charge a fee, so you’ll need to discuss joining them with your parents.  Whether you have an agent or not, it's important to find as many ways to market yourself as an actor as possible, especially if you don't live in L.A. or New York, where most acting opportunities are. Make videos for YouTube that demonstrate your acting skills -- there's no guarantee casting directors or agents will see your videos, but you never know when one will go viral.   Videos of school play and regional theater performances are ideal content for your YouTube channel. Local commercials or TV appearances are also a good idea because agents or casting directors outside your area probably haven't seen them. If you're feeling creative, you can also post original short films that help showcase your acting ability.  While most auditions will have a specific scene or group of scenes that you are required to perform, you may sometimes be asked to come up with your own material. That’s why it’s a good idea to work on a monologue or two, so you’ll always be ready when an audition comes up. Make sure to choose a piece that really allows you to showcase your acting skills.If you’re not sure what monologue(s) to prepare, consider some of your favorite movies -- there’s bound to be a piece in one of them that will work. It’s usually best to choose an age-appropriate monologue. If possible, find one that’s delivered by character who’s as close to you in age as possible.  In many cases, the casting company will send you a script or “sides,” which are just the portion of the script that pertain to the character that you’re reading for, in advance of the audition. Don’t just glance at your lines a couple of times to try memorize them -- make an effort to understand the character and figure out the best way to play the scene.Many casting directors won’t mind if you hold your script or sides during your audition. However, it’s best if you don’t read directly from it. Instead, just glance at it occasionally to remind yourself of the lines.  If you really want an acting career, you must take every audition seriously. While you may not have a job yet, you should act like a professional, so the casting director is comfortable working with you. That means being open to any suggestions that he or she might make and being willing to do the scene several times to get it right.Make sure to project confidence during your audition. If you don’t believe that you’re good enough for the part, the casting director probably won’t either.  Acting is an extremely competitive business, even for children. As a result, you’re probably going to go on many auditions that don’t end in a job -- but that doesn’t mean you should lose faith in your skills as an actor. As with most things, practice makes perfect, so the more you audition, the better you’ll become at impressing casting directors.If you realize at some point that you’re no longer having fun pursuing an acting career, talk to your parents. You shouldn’t keep at it if it only makes you feel bad about yourself.	Talk to your parents. Take acting classes. Get some experience. Get headshots. Find an agent. Get a work permit. Join online casting sites. Create a YouTube account. Prepare a monologue. Study the script or sides. Treat it like work. Don’t get discouraged.
The perfect size for an embroidery hoop is about 23 inches (58 cm) and the hoops can be found at any local store that sells crafts. Take the hoop apart and place its hardware pieces in a baggie to keep them from getting lost while you put the canopy together., Be sure that the casing seam at the top of your curtains are facing the hoop on its inside. Slide all six of the curtain panels around the circumference of the hoop., Clamp the two ends of the embroidery hoop together by inserting the hardware pieces you previously placed in the baggie. Slide curtains over the hoop’s closure and make sure that the curtains are distributed evenly around the circumference of the hoop., Cut three pieces of ribbon at about 4” long so that the hoop can hang a good distance away from the ceiling. If you want the canopy to hang down even lower from the ceiling, cut the ribbon pieces a little longer.Spread the curtains and loop the ribbons around the sides of the hoop. The ribbons should be looped onto the hoop every couple of panels so that the curtains are even on each side and the access points are more plainly seen.Tie the ribbons together at the top into a knot.  Hooks are available at most home improvement stores. Hang the knotted ribbon and your canopy curtains over the hook in the ceiling. Spread two of the panels to create a door.Add pillows to your finished canopy or stuffed animals to give the reading nook some personality. These reading nooks can also act as a tent around small arm chairs in children rooms and nurseries and can be the perfect place to read to your child while they’re in your lap.	Start crafting the canopy nook by taking apart the embroidery hoop. Slide the curtain fabric onto the embroidery hoop. Secure the hoop back together. Prepare the ribbons that will hang the canopy. Hang a hook from the ceiling and use it to hang the canopy on.
Pre-made trim comes in many different styles, colors, and shapes. Choose a trim that matches or compliments your upholstery. You can find pre-made trim at most hardware stores and craft stores.Some trim is accented with a piece of leather or cloth beneath the nails. This can be a great way of drawing a little more attention to your trim.  Use a pencil and a straightedge, like a ruler or meter stick, to draw an unbroken line where your nailhead trim will go. Be especially careful that this line is the same distance from the outside edge of the upholstery. This will help keep your trim straight.   When attaching your pre-made trim, you’ll only have to pound in nails every few inches (7 to 10 cm). The trim will cover your outline, hiding it from view., Attach your trim in sections to the outline. Do this by holding the trim in place over the line and pounding in nails to attach the trim where it has gaps. Continue this for the entire length of the outline.Your pre-made trim should have come with special nails that match or accentual the design of the trim. Use these for attaching the trim. If your pre-made trim didn’t come with nails, go to the hardware store to find nails that match your trim pattern. This way the nails used to attach the trim won’t look out of place.  Even slight deviations from your trim outline can leave your trim looking unsatisfactory. Step back and check for evenness. Adjust the trim where necessary by pulling out nails with a tack puller and reattaching the trim. Enjoy your nailhead trimmed furniture.When adjusting trim that is uneven, use fresh nails to reattach it. Nails that have been pulled out will be more likely to warp and need to be removed again, or they may deform, which can result in an undesirable appearance.	Select a suitable pre-made trim. Outline your trim placement on your upholstery. Install your trim along the trim outline. Check the straightness of your trim and enjoy.
A boat trailer has the added advantages of allowing you to boat on different bodies of water, to seize the random nice days in winter to fish or cruise and can save fees for winter boat storage. Be sure to check your vehicle owner's manual for safety rules, tips and complete instructions on boat towing capacity . This will help make sure you're selecting the appropriate boating equipment for the model you're buying.; , A typical rack storage facility keeps your boat in a covered shed filled with trailer-like cradles. Make a call to the facility a designated time before you want to go boating and they will use a forklift or other lifting machine to retrieve and launch your boat. When you come back, you tie it up, walk away and they return it to the shed.  You drive your family and gear to the marina, load the boat, cast off the lines and go. Rates vary from state to state and marina to marina, but typically you'll be charged according to the length of your boat or the length of the slip. Boat marinas often have showers and bathrooms and offer winter storage and service options. The best marinas offer connections for electricity, wash down water, telephone, Internet and TV at the dock. Boat marinas can be great fun as well, with slip-holders often getting together for parties, cookouts or just friendly socializing.  The slip becomes a long-term asset. This takes the annual guesswork out of the where-will-I-keep-my-boat equation in high-demand areas.	Consider Trailering:   You won't find a less-expensive way to keep a boat than storing it on a trailer in your driveway or backyard. See if Rack Storage is Available:   Another alternative for smaller boats is rack storage, or dry stacks. Contact The Boat Marina:   For owners of larger boats, and owners of small boats who crave convenience, a boat marina slip is the best way to go. Buy Your Slip:   In some locales, it's possible to actually buy a slip in a boat marina.
This will count as your first stitch. To make a slipknot, fold some yarn in half to make a loop in your non-dominant hand. Then, bring the tail end over the working end of the yarn so it crosses. Use the thumb and finger of your non-dominant hand to make a single loop, and poke your knitting needle through this loop. Gently tug on the yarn and yarn tail to tighten the knot.       ; , Push upward until you form a loop.  The tip of the needle should be pointing towards your thumb.  Make an upward motion with the needle as you do this.  Make the loop snug, but do not make it too tight.  Both the cast on loop and the slipknot should be the same size and tension. You may need to tighten or loosen the knots to do this.  Each cast on equals one stitch. The slipknot also counts as one stitch.          Try not to make knots too tight, or you won't be able to knit into them later.	Make a slipknot and slide it onto your knitting needle. Hold the needle in your hand and wrap the yarn around your thumb from behind the working yarn. Bring the needle in front of your thumb and the strand of yarn. Slip the needle under the yarn around your thumb. Pull your thumb out and tug on both strands of yarn. Push the loop down towards the slipknot, and adjust if necessary. Keep repeating the steps until you have the number of stitches the pattern requires.
As the date of Earth Day roughly coincides with U.S. Arbor Day, planting trees is a popular Earth Day activity. Trees helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clean pollution, secure soil in place to prevent erosion, and provide homes for many birds, insects and other animals. There's almost no more important, long-lasting act you can do to celebrate Earth Day.   Pick a tree that you know can survive in your climate. It's best to find a species native to where you live. If you're unsure about what that might be, ask an employee at your local garden shop, or inside the garden department of a big-box store. To ensure that the tree grows tall and strong, make sure you plant it correctly. Choose the correct planting spot to meet its needs, dig a properly-sized hole, and water the tree well to give it a good start.  Choose flowers that are native to your area and plant them in your garden or on nature strips where plants are usually grown. Restoring the local plant life will help attract native bird life, pollinators and local mammals. Here are a few examples of common flowers that will draw wildlife:   If you want to attract Monarch butterflies, plant milkweed, pansies or goldenrod.If you want to attract bees, plant bee balm, lavender or sage. If you want to attract hummingbirds, plant foxglove, petunias or lilies., You can do a lot for the creatures of the earth starting in your own yard or neighborhood. In their quest for the perfect lawn, many people drive out the insects, rodents, birds and reptiles that need a place to call home just as much as we do. Starting on Earth Day, why not welcome these nonhuman neighbors into your yard? Here's how to do it.   Instead of mowing the entire yard, leave a few sections unmowed. Bees, butterflies, and many other insects will find this inviting. If you're worried about them coming inside, have the unmowed area in the back of the yard instead of right next to the house. Install a bird feeder, bat feeder, squirrel feeder, hummingbird feeder, or any other type of feeder to attract more wild animals. Provide a source of water, like a bird bath or a small pond. Don't try to get rid of snakes, lizards, frogs, moles, squirrels, and the other creatures who want to hang out in your yard. Many of these animals are beneficial; they aerate your yard, eat mosquitoes and improve biodiversity in the area. Live and let live. Tell your neighbors to do the same!  , Pesticides and herbicides can harm wild animals, native plants, trees, pets, and even humans. Make Earth Day the day you stop using chemicals in your yard and try organic methods of weed and pest removal instead. Consider talking to your neighbors about making the whole neighborhood organic.   Getting rid of pests the old-fashioned way can actually be more effective than using pesticides. Try planting native plants to control the insect population. Use water to spray common insects like aphids off of your vegetable plants. When it comes to weeds, pulling them out by hand works better than any other method.  Whether you live near an ocean, river, forest, mountain, swamp or lake, wild areas like these need protection. They are home to many plants and animals who rely on them for food and shelter. On Earth Day, commit to protecting the wild places in your community by doing the following:   Join a group working to protect these areas from pollution and developments. Encourage people to respect wild spaces by not damaging animal habitats, littering, and dumping in the water.  Many groups use the weekend of Earth Day to clear roadways, highways and neighborhood streets of litter that has accumulated since the last clean-up day.Many companies donate gloves and bags for clean-up groups and villages organize bag pick ups. Once the group has collected the trash and placed the recycled bags along the road, get the village public works department to pick the bags up. It's a wonderful community project that you can do as an individual or with a group.	Plant trees. Plant wildflowers. Welcome animals into your yard. Talk to your neighbors about going organic. Commit to protecting local wild places. Clean up litter in your community.
You will want sturdy shoes for street dancing.   Well made sneakers or high top hip hop shoes will work very well for street dancing. Try to avoid wearing old, beat up shoes. The style of sneakers you wear doesn't matter as much, but it is important that they are sturdy and comfortable. Try to get a pair of high-quality shoes made from strong canvas or leather, with a strong support sole.; , You don't want to just start dancing without warming up. This can lead to an injury.Try skipping, jogging in place, or jumping rope to warm up your muscles and increase your heart rate. Try gentle stretches of the major muscle groups, holding them for 10-15 seconds each. Steady - rhythmic activity will also prepare you for dancing.  Street dance is all about music that has a strong beat.Hip hop or rap music is traditionally used for street dancing. You want to avoid anything slow. Keep the music vibrant and up tempo. Feel the beat of the music and use it to help you move to the music.	Choose the right footwear. Get warmed up. Choose some music.
For large areas, rent or buy a lawn spreader or a mechanical seeder, which shoots grass seed evenly across the lawn. For small areas, spread grass seeds by hand.   Use the amount of seed recommended by the lawn care expert at your home and garden store. It is important to use the correct amount of grass seeds to ensure your lawn grows evenly. Do not overseed your lawn. Do not use up extra seed by spreading it over the lawn. Overseeded areas will grow thin, unhealthy grass, because seedlings will compete for limited nutrients.  Newly planted seeds need to be protected from the elements until they take root. A thin layer of topsoil will help, but it's best to use a loose layer of mulch to help retain moisture.You can distribute this by hand or with a cage roller.   Yellow grain straw is a popular choice, since it's cheap and easily broken up by the mower once your lawn is established. Avoid hay, which has too many seeds, and fresh pine straw, which slows grass growth. (Aged pine straw is fine.)Other forms of mulch will also work, but apply dense materials such as compost or sawdust in layers no thicker than ¼" (6 mm)., Set your garden hose head to the "mist" setting and lightly water the seeds until it is thoroughly damp. For a larger lawn, run a sprinkler in the center of the area for a few minutes.   Don't use a powerful stream of water, or you will wash away the grass seeds. Newly planted seeds should be watered lightly every other day until the grass sprouts., Protect the newly planted seeds from trampling for the first few weeks. Consider putting up a sign or using a string or flags to cordon the area. If pets and other animals run loose, consider putting a temporary fence to protect the lawn from harm.	Scatter the seed. Protect seeds with topsoil or mulch. Water the seeds. Keep people and pets off the new lawn.
If dirt has sunk to the bottom of the reservoir, remove the reservoir from the car and clean it well inside. Reconnect the necessary wires and hoses when reinstalling the reservoir.; , Replace any faulty hoses.    Mix a washer fluid solution according to the fluid product. Fill the pump's reservoir to the necessary level with the solution. Use a funnel to help you. Use a formulated, non-freezing washer fluid in the wintertime.  Use a long pin or fine wire to pick out or poke through clogged dirt. Follow by rinsing the parts that are exposed with water.  Ask them to activate the washer system to send out fluid. Let the washer fluid solution flush the system of remaining dirt or deposits.   Detach hoses one at a time to make sure that washer fluid is exiting through them. If hoses are clean or new but fluid is not reaching them, the cause could be an electrical problem.  Rather than having to remove the washer fluid reservoir from the car to clean out dirt, etc., try filling it with water. Then siphon it out. Do this several times until the water comes out clean. It works a treat and will save you the job of trying to extract a rather difficult-to-access reservoir.  They should squirt fluid above the windshield's center. Adjust them if necessary.   Washer nozzles may be found on the windshield wiper arms. The nozzles could also be on the car's hood panel and aimed separately at the windshield. Other nozzle configurations are having one nozzle for the left and right sides of the car or having adjustable offset nozzles arranged on a base. Washer nozzles on wiper arms should not need adjusting because they are already centered and move with the arms. Individual nozzles may be adjusted by moving a tab connected to each nozzle by hand. If no tabs are present, gently adjust the nozzles with pliers. Adjust fixed nozzles by loosening a retaining nut for the entire nozzle body. Find the nut under the car's hood. Turn the nozzle so it sprays as much of the windshield as possible. Hold the nozzle in place and tighten the nut. Nozzles that can be adjusted in their body can be aimed properly with a screwdriver, wrench, or pliers. If the tools cannot grab onto the nozzle, insert a thin needle or wire into the nozzle's opening. Move the nozzle in the direction you want, but do not force it or your wire or needle could break and get lodged in the nozzle.    Turn off the car's power. Look for the pump on or in your washer fluid reservoir. It may also be attached to your windshield wiper's motor. Unplug the washer pump's electrical connector. Turn the ignition back on. Have someone else activate the washer and keep it on. Use a test light to see if the pump is receiving power. You can also listen for a humming sound and feel for a vibration from the pump to see if it is powered. If it is not getting power, check for a blown fuse. Access your car's fuse box, find the fuse for your washer pump, and replace it if necessary. You may need to take your car to a professional mechanic or auto shop to fix wiring or electrical problems, especially if the washer is activated by a button on the car's steering-column. If the pump does receive power but still does not send out fluid, it may need replacing. Take the pump out from its location and replace it with a new one. You will also want to replace the seal that the pump goes through into the tank.	Check the washer fluid reservoir for dirt. Look for cracks, leaks, or breaks in the plastic or rubber hoses connected to the washer reservoir. Add more washer fluid if necessary. Unclog dirt from nozzles, hoses or screens. Have someone else turn on your car's ignition. Try an alternative cleaning method. Check the aim of your washer nozzles. Check your washer pump's power if the fluid is still not appearing when activated.
The goal is to find a doormat that has no texture but an easy surface to hold the stones. Look for something with a sturdy backing as the stones will be heavy and you don’t want them to fall when moving the mat.   Measure the size you desire and then mark with the pencil. If you are satisfied with the size, you don’t need to cut the mat.; , Before adding a drop of glue you’ll need to position the stones so that they cover the mat.   Make sure they work cohesively on the mat, fitting together like a puzzle. Check to ensure no spaces are between stones or that you can see the mat. Design the mat to create a shape that closely resembles the mat shape you cut.  Without disturbing the layout add a layer of glue to the back of each stone and press into place.   Work slowly so that you don’t disturb the other stones in the layout that haven’t been glued into place.  Consider using a piece of board to slide underneath the mat to make moving it into place a smooth transition.   Use caution because although the stones are held by strong glue, they can still shift in transition so either use a hard surface to move the mat and/or slide it into place.	Cut doormat to size. Lay out stones on doormat. Add glue to the back of each stone. Allow for at least 24 hours of dry time before moving mat into place.
It could be singing, dancing, or playing an instrument. Make sure that the act you are doing showcases your talents. If you are doing anything involving music, make sure the music lyrics are compliant with your school's code.; , If your act is too hard or a part of it is difficult, edit that part out, redo it, or find something different to do.  Relax. Just go into the room and do your thing! Remember to say "Thank you" when you are done. You will find out later if you got in. If you did, congratulate yourself! If you didn't, ask the judges what fault they found in your performance so you know what to look out for next time!  ,, This is your time to mess up. Try on your outfit and makeup to see how it looks, and ask others. Accept advice or criticism when given.	Think of something that you do well that would fit into a talent show. Practice to make sure you have your act all ready the day you try out. Sign up and try out. Select the clothes you want to wear during the performance and makeup suitable for your act, if any.  , Practice in front of family and friends.
Wash the vase with soap and water, then pat it dry with a soft, clean towel. Wipe the entire vase down using rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oils that might prevent the paint from sticking., You do not have to cover the entire vase with painter's tape. Instead, wrap some painter's tape around your vase, just above where you want the gold to end. You will paint everything below that line., Run a credit card over the tape. This ensures that the edges are firmly sealed against the glass. It will help prevent the paint from seeping under it., Shake the paint bottle well, the pour a small amount onto a plate. Use a foam brush to pick up the paint, then dab on a thin layer onto the glass. Don't worry if it looks sheer.Apply the paint going in the same direction, ie: up-and-down. If you can't find any gold leaf paint, try gold enamel paint instead. It will give you a similar look., It's very important that you wait, or the paint may not cure properly. Once the two hours are up, apply another light coat of paint.Apply the paint going in the opposite direction, ie: left-and-right. If the paint still looks sheer after this, let the paint dry another two hours, then add a third coat., How long it takes for the paint to dry depends on the type of paint you are using. In most cases, it will take about 24 hours.Refer to your bottle of paint for specific drying times.  You can peel the tape away after 2 to 3 hours., If you have not yet done so, carefully peel the tape away. Your lines should be crisp and neat. If there are any chips, fill them in using a thin brush and gold leaf paint. You can also use a gold leaf pen instead.	Clean the vase. Mask off the areas you don't want painted with painter's tape. Seal the tape in. Start applying gold paint to the vase with a foam sponge. Let the paint dry two hours before applying another coat. Let the paint dry completely. Carefully remove the tape.
If an older friend or sibling is willing to buy you a ticket but the theater still won’t allow accompanied children into the movie, have your friend or sibling buy a ticket for themselves. Ask them to head inside to have their ticket torn by staff. After they sit in the theater for a few minutes, have them leave the theater and find you outside so they can give you the torn ticket stub, which you can then show the staff inside for “re-entry,” as if you had already gone in but then ran back out to take care of something outside.Scope out the staff ahead of time. See if they make a point of inspecting ticket stubs when people reenter, or if they just let people in when a ticket stub is shown at all. If they let people breeze by, you could possibly try using an old stub that you’ve saved from a previous movie.Use this trick at a multiplex with multiple ticket collectors. Avoid theaters that only assign one staff member for this job, since they may have a good memory for faces and thus know who has and hasn’t presented a ticket already.Wait for the line to back up, since staff will be more likely to wave stub-holders through while dealing with tickets that still need to be torn.  Pick a movie that you’re allowed to see. Choose one that starts a little before the one you intend to see. Give yourself time to switch theaters without missing the beginning of the movie you want to see.   If your multiplex has ticket collectors at the door to the theater that you want to sneak into, go watch the movie that you just bought a ticket for. Wait for the movie that you want to see to start playing. Leave the first theater and, if the ticket collectors are gone, sneak into the second. If they’re still there, go the restroom or concession stand as if that’s all you meant to do, and then try again in a little bit later. If your multiplex collects tickets at the front of the house and then lets you find your own way, just say thanks and sail right into the theater you want to go to once you find it.Use this trick at multiplexes rather than small, two-screen theaters, since you’re more likely to attract attention at the latter due to the lack of space.  Wait for a movie to let out. Go to a large multiplex, since these often have extra exits located throughout the building. Since these doors are exit-only,wait for a movie to let out, when a crowd will most likely exit all at once through these doors. Join the crowd as it spills out and act like you’re part of it. Then pretend you’ve left something inside. Head inside as though you’re going back in to find what you’ve supposedly lost.   Get your timing right. Avoid loitering outside the doors, since there may be security cameras. Search online ahead of time to find out what movies in which theaters are letting out when. This way you’ll know exactly when to be in place. Don’t go in as a group. Be believable; one kid running back inside to find something he’s lost is plausible, but a bunch of kids doing the same looks like a bunch of kids sneaking into a theater. If you’re going as a group, have only one person go inside while the others wait for him to come back, which adds credibility to your cover. Once the crowd disperses, have the inside man come back and reopen the door for the rest of the group. Be aware that this is technically theft.If you’re caught, you may be in more serious trouble than you would be if you tried to buy a ticket for a movie that’s not meant for you.  Have them purchase a ticket for any movie and enter through the front. Wait outside an exit-only door. Once the coast is clear inside, have them open the door for you.Know the layout. Keep an eye out for security cameras that may catch you loitering outside or opening the door from the inside. Be careful not to use a fire exit that triggers an alarm when opened. Remember, this is technically theft, so you may get in trouble for this.  Some theaters screen movies privately for staff after closing-time the night before a premiere. Since these screening are informal, ask anyone you know who works there if you can tag along.	Use a ticket stub. Buy a ticket for another film. Sneak into the theater. Have an inside man let you in. Go to a private screening.
This may be a subtle theme or the entire base of your room. Most room decorating articles say this, but it is quite important, otherwise your room will look random and untidy. If your walls are non-paint-able you may wish to add a large, coloured pin-board to your room. If you're lucky, your room came with one of these, but they are relatively easy to make and a savior when it comes to colour themes.; , You really should start over as new as possible. This means deciding what you don't need anymore, and what you can tidy away into your cupboard. Don't go too overboard though. You don't want to throw away things that you may want or need in the future. Create a storage space in your cupboard and hide away the things that don't suite your rooms desired look.  Look over your room: the colour of the walls, ceiling and carpet, the window frames, the colour of the doors... everything matters. Usually most of the above are a white or creamy colour, which can be good or bad (you decide). Also look at the position of the windows in your room, and how much natural light is let in. This overview of your room will give you and idea of what extra furniture or decorations you will need.   If your room is small and doesn't get much light, consider it more of a "night-time room". If your room is airy and gets a lot of sun, it is most probably a "day-time room". Some rooms are lucky enough to be both. Examples of this are rooms with slanting ceilings, skylights, or attic rooms. Although it may seem annoying, these rooms can look wonderful with the right decoration.  Put all the small things in a pile outside your room (books, reading lamps, tissue boxes), leaving the big things (like beds, dressers or bookshelves) in your room. This way you will be able you move your furniture into the position you want it in freely. Once you have done this you will be able to bring in the necessities, like the lamp and the books for the shelf, leaving the decorations till last.  Maybe you decided your room is a night-time room, so you got some fairy-lights. If it is a day-time room, you may have bought a couple of bean bags and made some tissue-paper fairy balls. Whatever it is, leave the decorating till last. If you don't you may later realize that that space is needed for something more important.	Decide on a colour theme. Tidy up!, Go with what you've got. Shuffle your things around. Decorate!
While it’s still running, watch the toilet for any signs of a rise in water level or bubbling in the water, these could indicate a blockage.; , When it gets to the point in the cycle that the water drains from the machine, inspect close by drains for water backing up into things like showers bath and basins  , If it has either risen or lowered, then there could be a blockage stopping the water flowing as freely as it should.  The water should go down the drain in a swirling motion when the tap is at its fastest water flow speed. If the basin is slowly filling up, then you have some form of blockage.  This indicates water flow issues, and therefore a blockage.  Bad odors can indicate that there is debris in your drain rotting and causing a blockage.	Turn on the tap in the bathroom and let the water run for about 1 minute. Do a load of washing in your washing machine. Flush the toilet and inspect the water level before and after flushing. Check all sinks and bathtubs for drainage speed. Listen for gurgling sounds when the basins and sinks are draining. Smell for odors around your sinks and showers.
Water pooled outside the refrigerator might be caused by a dirty drain pan. Your drain pan should be cleaned about once a year. Water pooled inside the refrigerator might be caused by a clogged drain tube. Clean out a clogged drain tube by forcing a solution of water and baking soda or bleach through the tube with a basting syringe.   The refrigerator should be turned off before attempting to clean the drain pan and tube.  If your refrigerator is not level, things might not seal correctly, and the defrost drain might leak. The refrigerator was designed to operate correctly when level. Unplug the refrigerator, then place a level on top of the refrigerator. Check the back and front of the appliance and adjust the feet until it is level throughout., If the water filter is not fitted properly, water may leak out. After unplugging your refrigerator, remove and reinstall the water filter. Also check for cracks in the water filter head and housing. If there are damages, your filter head or housing will need to be replaced.	Check the drain pan and tube. Level the refrigerator. Check the water filter.
Every living arrangement has its benefits and drawbacks, and in order for it to work, the benefits must be recognized and outweigh the drawbacks. When the going gets tough, remembering why you've chosen to live in a multigenerational household will help to cope with any conflicts that may arise. Some of the reasons families choose to live together are:   Money. Loss of a job or unexpected expenses, like divorce or death in the family. A big move, where one family unit lives with another family unit or member who is already in the area until they can become familiar with the area and establish their own home. A desire to live in an area with high costs. By having more family members live in a single house, the family can afford a nicer, larger house in a better neighborhood and with better schools. Working parents who prefer to have their own family members care for their children instead of strangers. Elderly relatives who need to be looked after by family instead of home care services. An emphasis on preserving religious beliefs and customs. Unexpected circumstances, such as a debilitating injury, heart problems, or an incurable disease. An extended family living situation can provide a helpful cushion if and when such circumstances arise.; , If it's a temporary situation, let your family know what your situation is.    Does anyone in the family have health issues that need to be addressed, such as an elderly parent needing special care, or a child with learning disabilities? If their care is home based, which of the other family members are primarily responsible for this care?  ,   Address your concerns about privacy. It can be hard to have privacy in this living situation. Make sure everyone understands the importance of privacy, and have consequences for anyone who invades anyone's privacy in any way, whether it's the Internet, your diary, going through personal belongings, and even listening in on phone calls. Part of maintaining boundaries is each member of the family knowing that giving advice, especially when it comes to problems or arguments by a married couple within the house, should only be given "if asked for." Never get into the middle of a couple's argument unless it's a case of abuse. Set physical boundaries. Some people have more "physical" personalities than others. Let your family know about your concerns about physical violence and/or inappropriate touching. Set acoustic boundaries. It's likely that at least one person in the house will enjoy hearing loud music or even television. Tell those who want loud music or television to use headphones. Set bathroom rules. Some people are more accepting about using the bathroom at the same time than others. Have locks on the bathroom doors to prevent accidental interruptions and embarrassments.  If the adults do not remain mindful of each other's rights and responsibilities, homework can sometimes be a source of discord in the house. What causes problems is a non-parent adult's sense of how far they should be allowed to go in deciding what is best for children. It's especially important for tell your parents and grandparents, as well as other family members not to counteract the rules you've set for your own children .  Of course, there are times when the unforeseen happens. If all the adult members work together, most problems can be resolved.  If it is a more personal problem, take the other family member aside and discuss it quietly. As mentioned earlier, there should be a time and a place where any family member can have privacy. It is under those circumstances that many personal problems can be addressed and resolved before they erupt into a major conflict.    Have one day and/or night a week of fun for everyone.	Know WHY this arrangement is in place. Discuss the the different circumstances with your family so that everyone is on the same page as to why you are living together. Define the responsibilities surrounding those who need to be cared for. Discuss boundaries as a group, as they must be respected by each household member, from the youngest to the eldest. Let parents raise their own children. Decide ahead of time who will be responsible for paying bills, and stick to this to the best of your ability. Call a family meeting if there is a problem you think needs discussing. Spend quality time together as a family.
The thread should be fine and strong; silk or cotton are good natural choices while polyester thread is long-lasting.Place the needle and thread on the underside of the fabric where you intend sewing the sequin into place.   Match the thread to the color of the sequin rather than to the fabric.; ,, Draw it through the center of the sequin. Leave a long tail of thread on the underside.  Cross the thread over the top of the sequin. , The more that you sew, the faster this will become as you get used to the rhythm of going through the motions.   When sewing sequins in a row, be sure that they're not overlapping unless this is the final look you wish to achieve.	Begin with fine, long needle and suitable thread. Place the sequin with care on the top side of the fabric, sitting in the position that you want it to be.  , Bring the needle up through the fabric. Return to the backside of the fabric. Tie the ends of the thread together on the back side to create secure knot.  , Move on to the next sequin.
Putting off going to visit a loved one in the hospital is always a mistake, as is waiting until the last days before a friend leaves the country forever. Don't miss out on your chance to say goodbye and brighten their final moments. Alone in the hospital can be a terrible place to die. Be in the room and say what needs to be said. Spend as much time with your loved one as possible. Be with him or her and support them.   Often, the dying want and are very comforted by one of four very particular messages: "I love you," "I forgive you," "Please forgive me," or "Thank you." If any of these seem appropriate, take care to include them in your goodbye., We often have the impression that death or other "forever" goodbyes are supposed to be a somber and joyless thing. But follow the lead of the person leaving. Your role is to be there for them and to comfort them in a time of need. If laughter is desired, or seems natural, then laugh.  It can be hard to know how honest to be with the dying. If you're visiting an ex-spouse or an estranged sibling, there can be lots of tension burbling under the surface, and complicated emotions at work in their passing. The hospital doesn't seem like the best time to let loose and tell off your father for being absent.   If you feel like the truth will hurt the person dying, recognize this and change the subject. Say, "You don't need to worry about me today" and change the subject. It can be tempting to want to be overly optimistic, saying "No, there's still a chance. Don't give up" if a loved one says, "I'm dying." There's no need to dwell on something neither of you know for sure. Change the subject to, "How are you feeling today?" or reassure them by saying, "You look great today."  , Always speak gently and identify yourself as the person speaking. Even if you're not sure you're being heard, say what needs to be said. The goodbye process in death works both ways--make sure you don't regret not saying "I love you" one last time. Even if you're unsure if the person can hear you, say it, and you'll know., Both physically and emotionally, be in the room. It can be difficult to avoid becoming hyperaware of the significance of the moment: "Is that the last time he'll say, 'I love you'?" Every moment can feel tense and electric. But get out of your own way and try, as much as possible, to experience the moments for what they are: time with a loved one.   Often, the dying have a great amount of control over the actual moment of their death and will wait until they're alone to save their loved ones the pain of experiencing it. Likewise, many family members are committed to being there, "To the end." Be aware of this and try not to put too much emphasis on the exact moment of death. Say goodbye when it seems appropriate.	Say goodbye now. Do what feels appropriate. Tell the truth, selectively. Keep talking. Be present.
Cranberries ripen in the fall. You can tell when they begin to ripen because they will change from green to bright red in color. This happens at the beginning of September and generally ends in mid-November. Cranberries that are dry harvested are less likely to get damaged than wet harvested berries. Dry harvested berries are the ones sold fresh at markets and stores.   Be sure to harvest by the first frost of the year for good quality berries.; , Dry harvesting of cranberries cannot be executed if there is any moisture on the plant. This includes rain, dampness from a frost or even dew. If there is any sign of wetness on the plants, hold off harvesting until things dry out., Similar in workings to a large, push lawn mower, the picker mows over the field. It has moving comb-like fingers that separate the berries from their vine. The berries are then shifted into an attached container, like a grass catcher. The berries in the container are then collected and sent to be processed. The one downside to the mechanical picker is that the machine can occasionally damage berries. Damaged berries are best used for juices and sauces.  If you are not growing many cranberry bushes, you could consider picking your cranberries by hand. While this takes a good deal of time, it is a more affordable way to pick the berries. Picking by hand is not recommended if you have a cranberry bog. Invest in a mechanical picker, which you can order online or through your local yard supply store. You can also rent or borrow a mechanical picker before you buy to decide if you want to make the investment. You can also use a handheld scoop if you only have a few bushes. This is much more cost effective for a few bushes than a mechanical picker., The reason that there are two ways to pick cranberries (dry or wet) is because cranberries grow in bogs. What a lot of people don’t know is that bogs are not always wet, thus farmers are able to dry harvest the berries. The other harvesting option is to flood the bogs with water. Cranberries float, so when the bogs are flooded, detached berries from the stems and float to the top of the water, where they are able to be scooped up., The harvest begins a day before the farmer actually collects the berries as he pumps water into the cranberry fields. The amount of water can range from six up to about 18 inches (45.7 cm). These bogs are impermeable--specifically created with layers of various growing mediums--so flooding them is not difficult.   However, keep in mind that flooding harvest requires that you prepare the ground before you flood it. It is also only worth doing if you have many bushes. If you only have a few, then picking by hand is your best bet.  Machines, fondly called 'egg beaters' are used to agitate the waters. This process separates the cranberries from their vines. Because cranberries grow with a little pocket of air inside them, they float. All loosened berries come to the surface of the water., A net is stretched from one end of the bog to the other. It is walked across the field and gathers the berries as it moves. Instead of a net, sometimes a machine like the boom of a boat is used to gather the berries.  Cranberries are then vacuumed up and into trucks to be shipped out to a processing plant. These berries arrive to consumers in some kind of processed form--either juice, sauce or other processed foods. Wet harvesting does more damage to the berries than dry harvesting, which is why these berries are made into sauces, juices or jellies., One of the best ways to do this is to look at the color of the berries. Depending on where your berries grow, their colors can range from light, but vibrant, red to a very dark crimson color. They should also be firm to the touch. These berries are the ones that make it into the fresh produce section of your grocery store. They are best used for cooking and baking., While this may sound strange, a great way to sort the best berries from the not as great ones is to bounce them. Quality berries are firm and springy--meaning they bounce off the ground nicely. They bounce because of the air bubbles inside the berries. Don’t throw them as hard as you can at the floor, but a simple drop against a flat surface should be enough to tell you whether or not your berries have the bounce.  You can either use the fresh ones in a recipe, or freeze them for later use. You might also consider drying some of the cranberries for a delicious snack.   Fresh, bouncy cranberries will last for up to two months in the refrigerator.	Know the right time of year to pick cranberries. Choose a dry day. Walk a mechanical picker through the fields. Know that cranberries grow in bogs. Flood the bogs. Stir the waters. Collect the berries. Pick up the cranberries. Sort the berries for qualities. Bounce the berries. Keep the bouncy berries and discard the rest.
You need a party hat that is made from lightweight cardboard to make a unicorn horn. You can find them at your local party store and some grocery stores.  Find out where the hat is connected, and undo it so you can roll it out flat. If the party hat is taped, remove the tape or gently cut the tape to undo it. If the hat is glued together, carefully use scissors to separate it. Then, unroll the party hat out flat.         Keep the elastic attached to the hat  , To make the horn, you need to roll the hat up again, but roll it tighter than it was before. Start with one side of the party hat, and roll it towards the other side creating a tighter roll. Keep rolling until you have a nice tight cone shape.  Use tape to secure the hat into the horn shape. Use a hot glue gun, or put several pieces of tape on the outer edge of the party hat to secure it to the hat.  Put the base of the horn on top of your forehead and pull the elastic over the back of your head to wear your new unicorn horn.	Get a party hat. Undo the party hat. Roll the hat tighter. Tape the hat together. Wear your new unicorn horn.
Before brainstorming for ideas, you need to design a budget. After designing a budget, you'll know the exact resources you have to create your dining room.   Start with savings or other money you've set aside for your dining room. Allocate money for painting, flooring, and other structural elements. It might be best to get estimates from several contractors for these costs. Determine how much money you have for major pieces of furniture. This includes your table, chairs, and buffet. Figure out how much money you want to reserve for accessories like artwork, plants, or rugs.; , Spend time browsing a variety of media in order to get ideas about how you'll plan your dining room. Without looking at how others have designed inviting dining rooms, you won't be equipped to prepare your own. Consult:   Furniture catalogs. Home improvement magazines. Consider magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "Martha Stewart Living," or "Good House Keeping." Websites. Try websites associated with popular magazines or TV channels like HG TV.  The style of a dining room is largely responsible for the feel of the overall room. Thus, you need to make sure you are conscious of the style you are choosing when you design your dining room. If you’re not, your room may clash or send mixed signals to guests.   Consider styles such as neoclassical, Tudor, art deco, French countryside, or shabby sheik. Your style may or may not reflect the overall style of your home. If you choose a clashing style, make sure to clash responsibly and do so deliberately. For instance, you may choose to stick an art deco serving table into a room decorated with a Tudor style., As the centerpiece of your dining room, your table will set the tone for the whole room. If you choose an inappropriate table, you’ll inadvertently set a tone that you don’t want.   Your table should be an appropriate size for your room. You should have at least 36 inches (91 cm) between your table and the wall (or furniture). Ideally, you should have 48 inches (123 cm) between the two. Think about whether you want an expandable table with leaves. Consider the style of your table and whether it will match other accent furniture. Major styles include traditional (with many ornate details), contemporary style (relatively simple), transitional (some ornate details but relatively simple), and the country style (these might appear shabby chic or distressed). Determine the material you want your table made from. While some people prefer a traditional wood, others might want a upscale mahogany, and some people may want a modern-looking glass or metal table. Think about whether the table will age well. Ultimately, a cheap table that looks good today might look horrible in 5 years – forcing you to redesign your whole dining room., Seating is an essential element in any dining room. Thus, you need to put a lot of thought into the types of seating and number of options you’ll include. When picking seating, consider:   Provide seating for your average dining party. For most people, this ranges from 8 to 12. Pick chairs based on style and comfort. The style should match or compliment the overall style of the room. In addition, chairs should be comfortable so people can relax and enjoy their meal. Think about using benches or even stools as an alternative to table chairs. Consider adding couches, loveseats, or extra chairs throughout the space. Couches and loveseats, in particular, can create a more intimate setting in a large dining room., After your table and chairs, you need to think about serving tables and side tables when designing your inviting dining room. These tables are important, as they’ll likely make your serving experience easy and more user-friendly.   Consider a buffet. A buffet is a long table or piece of furniture where you can store dishes (underneath or in cabinets) and place food before it is served. Think about adding a simple serving table. Like buffets, simple serving tables are a place to stage food before it is served or a place to sit food and allow people to serve themselves. Add side tables. Side tables are important if you have informal seating areas in your dining room. They may be a place for company to set drinks or appetizer plates while they chat., After picking your furniture, you need to pick accent pieces that will add more character to your dining room. Accent pieces will tie everything together, add your personal touch, and impress guests with your thoughtfulness.   Lighting fixtures. Mirrors. Artwork. Artwork could include paintings, pieces of pottery, glass work, or more. Plants. Rugs. Remember to not add too many accent pieces, as you don’t want the room to feel crowded. This ultimately, is an art rather than a science. A typical rule of thumb, though, is to make sure there is plenty of wall space, floor space, and table space between each item or cluster of items., An important and often overlooked element of any inviting dining room is the drapery. Drapery can set the tone of the room and tie different, contrasting elements together. On the other hand, a poor choice of drapery can send negative messages to your guests.   Choose your drapery after you’ve chosen other major elements of your dining room, like the main pieces of furniture (seats, the table, and serving tables). Depending on your taste and style, you may want to match your drapery to rugs or other accent pieces. Your drapery should always be chosen when considering the color of your wall and floor., At its very core, your dining room is a place where people will experience the colors and textures you’ve chosen. Thus, you need to make sure the color scheme is appropriate, planned, and inviting.   Don’t mix warm and cool undertones. For instance, don’t choose a warm wall paint (tan) and cool drapes (light blue). Consider this when matching the floor, wall paint, and furniture. Avoid mixing smoky or muted colors with bright colors. For instance, don’t choose a washed-out red for drapes and a bright lime for the wall paint. Think about this when you are creating a plan for the whole room. Paint small rooms cool colors. Cool colors, like grey, white, or light blues, will make a smaller space seem larger. Use warm colors in large spaces. Warm colors, like browns, tans, or reds, will make large spaces seem more intimate., When it comes to dining rooms – and other rooms – first impressions are very important. To create an inviting dining space, you need to make sure that the view from your entryway is truly inviting.   Avoid blocking the entryway with tables or chairs. Make sure the space of the entryway transitions into the space of the dining room. For example, if you can balance the walkway space from the entryway and the space between your table and a side table or buffet, do so. Pick a couple pieces of artwork or furniture that will capture your guests’ attention as they enter the dining room., As a place where food will be served and people will dine, your dining room needs to be a place where people can easily move around. Without ample space to move, your room won’t be inviting.   Space chairs so people can easily leave the table. Don’t situate a table to close to a wall or piece of furniture. Take out any pieces of furniture that inhibit the movement of people. For example, while you want to add a cute coffee table to your informal sitting area, it may hinder the movement of people through that corner of your dining room., The easiest way to turn an inviting space into an uninviting space is to clutter it up. By cluttering a space, you send the message that items are more important than people. You also distract people from all the planning you’ve done on your color scheme and furniture.   Don’t view wall space as something to fill or conquer. Position painting and furniture a couple feet apart. Never try to cover table, curio, or china cabinet space completely. Focus on an elegant and balanced look rather than a full look. For instance, you don’t need to display all your rare salt and pepper shakers. Display your most cherished ones, and store the rest. Ask friends and family if they think your dining room has a bare or cluttered look. Let them know that you just want their honest opinion. For instance, say “John, can you honestly tell me whether this room looks bare or cluttered? I’m trying to create an inviting dining space and I think I’m not there yet.”	Design a budget. Look for ideas. Pick a coherent style. Choose your table. Add seating. Pick serving tables and side tables. Choose accent pieces. Choose your drapery. Decide on the color scheme of the room. Create an attractive view from the room’s entryway. Provide ample space to move. Avoid cluttering your dining room.
Most successful candidates will practice before attempting to take the driving test. Once you have your permit, you can practice with a CDL holder 25 or older in the vehicle.

This routine is a slightly tweaked version of the 6-step. It requires a bit more skill and athleticism as the fifth step is changed so you switch the placement of your body weight quickly. The 5-step is not for beginners so make sure you have a master of the 6-step before attempting this variation.   The first few moves of the 5-step are identical to the 6-step. So you're starting in the push-up position, and extending the right leg in front of the left while keeping the left leg in place. Lean on the outside of your right foot and take your left hand off the floor. Pull the left leg forward. This motion is the same as in the 6-step. Bend your left leg to where it is touching the back of your right leg. Your right leg should be wrapped loosely around your left leg, and you should be in a tilted cross-legged position while keeping your left hand in the air. Bring your right leg out from around your left leg. You should be in the crab position where your legs are shoulder-width apart and your left hand is on the floor behind you. Cross your left leg around your right leg. As in the 6-step, make sure to lean on the outside of your left foot while lifting your right hand up. Here's where it differs. Instead of bringing your right leg behind you as you would in the 6-step, shift hands so you're leaning on your right hand again. Once your body weight is shifted on the right hand, kick your right leg out with your left hand in the air. Bring your right leg in so you're at a crab position which will serve as your new starting point to repeat the 5-step., This version changes certain moves in the beginning while adding an extra step as well that requires more nuanced footwork. When practicing the 7-step, make sure to highlight the differences between the 6-step to make this variation stand out.   As with the 6-step, start in a push-up position on your toes, fingertips, or your palms. Avoid flat feet and hands. Don't bring around your left leg to touch the back of the bent right leg. Instead, bring your left leg over your right so your hip is jutting outward while the right remains in place. You can put your hand on the hip if it helps to maintain balance. Bring your right leg under and in front of your body so it is stretched out while your calf is parallel to the floor. Your left leg while stay in place. Bend your right knee so you are in the crab position. Here both feet should be firm planted should-width apart while your left hand rests behind you. Hook your left leg around your right so your right leg is bent and touching the back of your left. Step your right foot behind you while keeping the left stationary. Bring your left foot under your body so your feet are shoulder-width apart in the same push-up position you started with. , Practice the routine in both directions for added flexibility. You can also reverse alternate directions during the same routine, which will be helpful when adding freezes, where your body stays motionless, and other variations.	Master the 5-step variation. Bring your A-game for the 7-step. Try the 6-Step in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
A stuck thermostat might be to blame if your gauge marker nears the red danger zone within five to 15 minutes.; , Unhook your coolant reservoir if you can undo it and pour the antifreeze into a container. Locate your radiator and remove the cap.    You might not need to drain the radiator, depending on the amount your reservoir holds. The amount drained is roughly 1 to 2 qt. (4 to 8 cups). You can reuse this coolant if it is brand new. Otherwise, replace it with new coolant.  The thermostat housing is usually under the upper radiator hose. Unbolt the housing and remove the thermostat, using a screwdriver and pliers. Take the thermostat inside. There will generally be a number somewhere on the body, giving it's opening temperature usually between 160 to 190°F or 70 to 90°C. Otherwise you will need to check the Workshop Manual for the car.  Ensure that the part does not touch the bottom of the pan.  Check the temperature frequently while monitoring the thermostat.   The thermostat should remain closed until it just about reaches the thermostat-opening temperature designated on the body (or in the Workshop Manual). At this temperature, you should see the thermostat begin to open. The part should be completely open when the water reaches approximately 10 degrees above the reading on the thermostat. If the thermostat is still closed at this point, it needs to replaced.	Check your temperature gauge in the car. Turn off your car and allow it to cool before opening the hood. Unfasten the radiator drain cock located near the bottom of the radiator and allow some of the coolant to drain out into a container with a lid until the level is below the upper radiator hose. Locate your thermostat. Fill a pan with water and place the thermostat into the water until it's completely submerged. Start heating the water and place a cooking thermometer into the water.
You need less soap when you have soft water.   You can do a quick test to see if you are currently using to much soap by simply running the washer on a normal cycle and DO NOT add any soap. Also do not add any clothes but run it empty. Notice after about 5 minutes before it drains for the first time if you have soap bubbles on top of the water. You may need a flashlight to see into the drum through your glass door. You can also push the pause button an when you hear the click of the door lock release open the door to inspect. Now close the door and resume the cycle. The very first fill cycle is when the soap that is normally added gets mixed in with the clothes. Every fill cycle after the first drain is only to rinse the clothes. If you get bubbles after your last regular load, you were using so much soap that even with all the regular rinse cycles you were not able to totally rinse out the soap. This will shorten the life of your clothing as they are not meant to have soap in them when the wash cycle is over. You can also test to see if you have residual soap built up in your laundry by putting in a load of CLEAN towels that have not been used yet and run a normal cycle but DO NOT add any soap. Check again toward the end of the first cycle and see if you have any bubbles in the water. If you do, you have soap in the towels from previous washings.; , Some people will tell you that you need to use powdered HE soap vs liquid HE soap. As someone who has worked on the front load machines and taken them totally apart to fix them. Powdered soap that does not totally dissolve can get into the nooks and crannies of the internal metal parts of the machine, which over time cause the parts to fail prematurely. For this reason, use liquid and use the right amount for your water.  For a reference, 2 tablespoons of liquid detergent just covers the bottom of the cap that the soap manufacturer gives you to measure out the soap.   Think about it, the soap manufacturer is in the business of selling soap and is not going to tell you to use less soap because that means less business for them. The manufacturer of your machine is also not going to tell you not to use too much soap because using too much soap will cause your machine to fail prematurely which means you will be a customer for them much sooner then you really need to be, which means more revenue for them.  This is what the internal parts of you washer can look like if you have been using too much soap.  The soap is a food for the black mold that grows inside the pipes of your machine, which is what you are smelling when you smell a foul odor. If you have been using close to the correct amount of soap, then you may not have that odor yet but given enough time most front load machines will get that smell.	Determine if you have hard or soft water. If you have soft water, you only need about 1 tablespoon (1/16 cup) of liquid High Efficiency (HE) soap. If you have hard water, never use more than 2 tablespoons (1/8 cup) of liquid HE soap. After you have used the correct amount of soap (as outlined above), for a month or two, run the same test above just to make sure that with your water and the brand soap you use, it is the correct amount. Using too much soap also adds to the smell that most front load machines either have (or will have) over time.

Give yourself a small budget and enjoy some quality e-commerce time. Take a break from social media. Reach out to a loved one.
In order to redecorate your room, it is best to start from scratch and gather as many materials as possible. Wiping your room clean will give you a better view of its size, as well as allow you to plan the new layout. Although it may seem useless, the clutter filling up your room could be transformed into decorations if you take the time to sort through it. Take the time to gather all your belongings into one pile, removing items from the floor and furniture. While your room is cleared, run the vacuum over the carpet to remove grime and dirt.; , Once you have cleared out your room, go through your items and categorize them according to their purpose (example: clothes, games, decorations). Set aside belongings that could potentially serve as decorations or materials for a project (example: empty photo frame). Dispose of unwanted ones in a trash bag for quick disposal. Avoid keeping them out of sentiment, as they only waste space in your room. If you have unwanted belongings in good condition, such as clean clothes and books, donate them to a charity shop or have a garage sale. You could also offer them to your friends and family.  Once you have cleared out and tidied your room, decide on its new appearance. You have a variety of options to choose from, such as rearranging the furniture or putting up old posters and pictures. To give yourself a better view, you could sketch out a blueprint of an ideal layout for your room. If you plan on repositioning your furniture, be sure that you leave enough space for the rest of your belongings. You should also make sure that you have room to walk around without feeling suffocated.   Rearranging your furniture is a simple method to transform your room. It can give you a fresh change of scenery and costs no money.  While this step is optional, finding matching colors will help complement your room and make it appear professionally decorated. Select a few decorations (ex: albums, posters, pillows) that have matching colors before setting them up in your room. Be sure that they match your furniture, as well as your bedspread., Search through your categorized piles for cheap decorations to use. Redesigning a room doesn't necessarily require many decorations, as setting out a few in an artistic manner can be more powerful than spreading them all over the place. Find a few eye-catching pieces to personalize your room. These could include photographs of your family, posters of your favorite singers, your favorite albums, etc.  This is an easy, cheap way to decorate a blank wall. A mood board involves a collection of items that evokes happiness. They are pinned onto a large cork board, which can then be hung onto the wall. Simply gather together items that reflect your personality, such as photographs, old concert tickets, CD covers, quotes, magazine clippings/pictures from your favorite films and television shows. Using these materials, create a collage on your board, pinning each one securely in place. Don't worry if it seems cluttered, as its appearance is enhanced with each item that you add.  These can transform your room and change your perspective of it, encouraging relaxation and satisfaction. Simply adding small items - such as photographs of your loved ones in frames or stuffed animals - can spark old memories and evoke feelings of happiness. You should remind yourself that your room belongs to you, which means that you should add small touches of your life to it.  Pasting stars onto the ceiling is a popular method to spice up your room. They not only serve as wonderful decorations during the day but also glow beautifully when the night falls. However, if you don't have glowing stars, you can simply part your curtains to allow the moonlight to flood your room.  A simple way to transform your room is to add a personalized touch to your walls. You could hang up photographs or art pieces, as well as a calendar or cork board. However, you could also draw on your walls, provided that you have received parental permission. Be sure that you are certain about the design you want, as it can be expensive to repaint your walls.	Clear your room. Separate your belongings into piles. Plan the layout. Choose a color scheme. Recycle old items. Make a "mood board". Add small touches. Add glowing stars. Decorate your walls.
Place them on a piece of drop cloth or a sawhorse in a well ventilated area. You should choose to undertake this project when the weather is moderate and not too humid.; , Label them according to the type and set them aside until the painting is done.  Open doors, windows and have a shop vacuum nearby. Place drop cloths around the cabinet boxes.  You should wear long sleeved shirts and long pants, safety goggles, a particulate mask and gloves when sanding.  To increase your efficiency and improve results, buy a small sander, such as a mouse sander, at a home improvement store.   Your goal is to remove the shiny finish of the particle board. Try to sand evenly to avoid creating an uneven surface. The surface right underneath the finish can start to break away if sanded too hard.  Wipe the surfaces of your cabinets with tack cloths. Keep the indoor areas covered, and place cardboard or drop cloths under your sawhorse.  Kilz primer is highly recommended for this type of project, because it seals, primes and blocks stain. It sticks well to particle board.  If you are doing both sides of a cabinet door, wait until it is dry before applying to the opposite side. Allow it to dry well before moving on to paint.  Make sure you sand out any drips from the primer itself. Wipe again with a tack cloth.  Check the reviews at consumer reports before buying, because a quality latex paint is necessary to adhere well to your laminate or particle board cabinets.   Make sure you test your paint colors before you apply them to your entire cabinet set. Test the inside of a door to ensure you like the look.  Use a small foam roller set for doors and large areas of the cabinet box. Use a paint brush to get into the crevices and smaller areas.  Apply a second coat.  You can either choose a finishing wax or a clear lacquer. Apply 2 coats of the material of your choice according to package directions. , Remove the drop cloths and clean up the area around your cabinets using a shop vacuum and detergent.	Remove the doors and drawers from the cabinet set. Remove hardware, such as drawer pulls, hinges and door knobs with a screwdriver. Create a well-ventilated space. Put on safety clothing. Use 80-grit sandpaper pads to sand down all the exterior surfaces of your cabinet boxes, drawers and both sides of the doors. Vacuum the entire area and cabinet boxes with a shop vacuum to remove as many particles as possible. Spray the surfaces of your cabinets with an oil-based spray primer. Spray according to package directions. Sand the cabinets with 220-grit sandpaper. Buy high-quality interior paint at a hardware store. Paint the surfaces of the cabinets with the latex paint. Allow the paint to dry. Apply a finishing material to the cabinets. Let the paint cure on the cabinets, doors and drawers for 2 days to 2 weeks, depending upon the ventilation and heat during your project.  , Reattach the hardware and the drawers and doors.
Get comfortable playing in front of a crowd. You’ll likely have to play a lot of non-paying gigs before you can land any playing ones.   Perform at open mics. Volunteer to play at retirement homes. Busk (play on the street) if it’s allowed in your city.  Plan out your live show. You want to make sure you have a great stage presence as to go along with your music. Find out what you can do to make your show more engaging.Add personal stories to go along with your songs. Tell jokes. Learn dance moves that will help your audience get into the music.

Practice engaging with the audience.  Contact booking agents in your area to try to secure gigs. Give them your demo and a link to your website so can hear your music and decide whether it fits their venue. Booking agents are constantly being approached by musicians so it can sometimes take weeks or months for them to get back to you. Remind them politely by email periodically that you’d still like to play at their venue.Be honest about your draw. Don’t say you can bring in more audience than you’re sure you can. When you do book a gig, always be on time and be respectful of the crew.  Try to talk to people who enjoy your show to make new fans. Show them where they can go to find your music. Have them join your mailing list. You may even meet people who have skills and can help you further your career. Getting your music heard is all about connecting with people who want to support you.   Be organized. Have a list of the people in the music industry you meet and what they do. Stay in touch.

Rehearse your show. Book gigs. Meet people.
When moved up or down, this lever will cause a light on either the left or right side of your car to flash.   The turn signal will not make a sound or light the signal light on your car unless the car is running.; , To signal a left turn, wait until you are approximately 30 yards from the corner around which you intend to turn.Ensure you are in the left-turn lane, then push the turn signal lever down gently with your left hand. When the turn signal locks in place, you’ll be able to see a flashing arrow directed to the left on your instrument cluster. You’ll also hear a tick-tock sound which clicks in time with the flashing of the light. This indicates that the signal is operating properly. Return your hand to the steering wheel and continue driving.   Keep your right hand on the wheel while flicking the signal lever down with your left hand. Turn on the signal before braking to let other drivers know why you are slowing.  Ensure you are in the right-turn lane, then move the lever up with your left hand. The series of events which follow are similar to those which occur when making a signal to turn towards the left.   Once you have moved the lever up, an arrow light will begin blinking on the dashboard instrument cluster. You will also hear a metronome-like sound at regular intervals which clicks in time with the flashing light on your instrument cluster.  Normally, the signal will automatically turn off after you have made the turn. Some turns which are at angles of less than ninety degrees, however, might not trigger the automatic suspension of the turn signal after you’ve made the turn. Failing to turn your turn signal off after you have completed a turn can be illegal and cause confusion for other drivers.It is easy to see if your turn signal is still on after you’ve made a turn. Just check the indicator panel above and just behind your steering wheel. Listen for the rhythmic tick-tock sound of the signal blinking on and off. If you see the indicator light blinking or hear the signal sound, reach over to the signal lever with your left hand and gently move it to the “off” position.  Some traffic lanes are reserved for left or right turns only. While it might seem unnecessary to indicate you’re turning when it should be obvious based on the lane you’re in, use the turn signal anyway. Drivers who are not familiar with the area or who cannot see the signs due to multiple vehicles ahead of them in the lane will appreciate the indication as to where you are headed, and could clue them into the fact that your lane is for turning in a given direction. Plus, the law requires that you make a turn with your turn signal.  If you turn your signal on too soon, someone might think you are turning into a parking lot or down a street which you actually are not. This confusion could lead to an accident or to you being cut off.	Locate the lever on the left side of the steering column.The turn signal is a long lever, usually black or gray in color. Use the turn signal to indicate a turn to the left. Indicate a right-hand turn with the turn signal.To signal a right turn, wait until you are within about 30 yards of the corner you wish to round. Ensure your turn signal turns off after your turn has been completed. Signal your turn even if you are in a turning lane. Don’t turn your turn signal on too soon.Only activate your turn signal when there are no intervening streets or alleys between you and the place you wish to turn.
Be ready to negotiate split-second emergencies. Maintain as much control as possible over the car at all times. If your car has a manual transmission, shift gears when needed, but do not keep a needless grip on the gearshift afterward. Instead, return your hand to the steering wheel immediately.Turning on your windshield wipers, headlights, and turning signals also require you to remove one hand from the wheel.But these controls are typically located close to the steering wheel to minimize the time spent driving one-handed. Reversing the car is an exception to this rule.; , Resist the urge to slacken your grip on the wheel. At the same time, be careful not to clench the wheel too tensely. This can tire your arms out and possibly obscure warning signs that reverberate through the steering wheel.”Feeling” the car through the steering wheel is another important reason to steer with both hands.  Picture the steering wheel as an old-fashioned clock with 12 o’clock as the apex of the wheel. With your left hand, hold the wheel at either 9 or 10 o’clock. Then hold the other side at either 3 or 2 o’clock with your right.10-and-2 is better suited for older cars or any others with larger steering wheels and no power steering. 9-and-3 has become the new norm for modern cars equipped with power steering, smaller steering wheels, and airbags.  While driving on paved roads, hold the wheel with your thumbs hooked around the steering wheel. If you turn off-road, remove your thumbs. Place them along the steering wheel's rim, as if you were giving two thumbs-up.Hooking your thumbs under the rim while driving off-road may set you up for injury. Your tires could strike obstacles hard enough to jolt the steering wheel in your hand.If you are driving on a paved road with your hands at 9-and-3, nestle your thumbs along the wheel's spokes where they meet the rim.	Hold the wheel with both hands. Keep your grip firm. Hold the wheel at at "10-and-2" or "9-and-3.", Mind your thumbs.
Bubbles and wind do not mix. You can prolong the life of your bubbles by moving indoors. Blow your bubbles in an enclosed room, such as a garage or a classroom.   Do not blow the bubbles inside a house. The solution may stain the furniture, flooring, or walls., The best, longest lasting bubble solutions, do not contain imperfections. You can limit the imperfections in your solution by using distilled or filtered water. Additionally, only mix the solution in a clean container., Bubbles love a moist, humid environment. In addition to adding glycerin, a natural moisturizer, you can also use a humidifier. The humidifier will add moisture to the air, increasing the life of your bubbles.	Avoid the breeze. Minimize debris. Add moisture to the air.
Instead of using an acronym or technical jargon, use a relevant word or phrase that provides the same meaning. For example, business people like to use SME’s (pronounced like "smees") to describe a person who is a Subject Matter Expert. The time you save by saying “SMEES” is lost when it causes an unfamiliar listener to try to figure out what you mean. Just say “Subject Matter Expert” or “Expert” or “Business Owner” or something to describe the same thing. If you cause your audience to have to think about your last words then they will stop listening until they figure out what you meant.; , If you have the opportunity to discuss a topic that you know a lot about, it is easy to talk at a level of detail that nobody can follow (or care about) except you. People typically only care that the overall process works, not how it works. In sales you talk about benefits with the assurance that the product works, not the features or how it works. Eventually the question will come up where you can bring up the details but that should be based on knowing that your audience wants those details.  The titles people give you in introducing themselves at the beginning of a meeting may be impressive, but not necessarily indicative of what they care about. Don’t rely on their role or title. Instead ask how much detail your audience wants from you. This will not only help you earn their respect it also helps you stay on time and on track.	Use words and phrases your audience understands. Be concise and talk about what’s important to your audience. Ask your audience what they want to hear from you.
Separate your must-have cleaning items into different types, like pre-wash or treatment items, stain-removing items, and post-wash items. Organize them in their own containers for quick access and to prevent damage if something leaks out.; , Buying in bulk can ease the financial strain associated with your chores, so divide dry items into smaller, refillable containers. They have a better appearance, and you will know when it’s time to replace them., Store these in open spaces to allow the laundry to breathe. This will keep your laundry from mildew and other odors. Line your baskets with cloth bags that you can occasionally wash so they can stay fresh.  The best way to access what you need is to know what you are looking at.Even if you know what something is by looking at it, your brain still takes a moment to register it, or you might be distracted. Save your brain for thinking matters, like how to remove specific stains.   Label your cleaning supplies with the same symbols that you find on clothing tags for easier reference.Use small chalkboard labels for containers that house a hodgepodge of rotating items.  Change and other small knick-knacks can collect in pants pockets, and having a small pile of junk can throw off a perfectly organized shelf. A vintage jar can add a nice minor source of inspiration and collect that wayward shrapnel., If you have the resources to create custom cabinetry, mix up drawers and shelves so you can store a larger number of items. If you don’t have those resources, search out shelves that you can build up to maximize your walking space.   Shelves can also be installed from above, which keeps the floor open and doubles as an area to hang dry.  The ironing board is a hefty item that can easily take up space. Luckily, it can fit easily in narrow nooks behind your appliances. Alternatively, hang it up. Whichever you decide, keep your iron and a bottle of distilled water in the same area.	Group cleaning supplies together. Transfer bulk items to manageable sizes. Use laundry baskets to separate clothes. Label everything. Place a bowl or jar near the washer. Build up. Put your ironing board away.
Although dirt does not directly cause rust, dirt and sediment can wear through your paint over time, especially when anyone touches the paint. Other things that can reduce your vehicle’s protection against rust include bird droppings and gasoline that spills when filling the vehicle. Over time, these things wear through wax, clear coat and paint, leaving the metal susceptible to rusting.Wash your vehicle every few weeks so sand and dirt can’t be rubbed through the paint. Bird droppings and gasoline can eat through the paint. Consider washing your vehicle if either comes into contact with the paint.  If you live in an area that snows in the winter, salt and chemical deposits on the underside of your vehicle can compromise its ability to protect against rust. Wash the underside of your vehicle regularly to prevent these materials from sitting on your vehicle for long.Many automatic car washes offer undercarriage cleaning. You may also jack up your car and spray the underside using a hose.  If you often have to deal with road salt, you may choose to add a small amount of baking soda to the soap and water you wash the undercarriage and wheel wells of your vehicle with. A tablespoon of baking soda will neutralize the acidic effect of the salt and other ice melting chemicals used on the roads.Make sure to use baking soda in conjunction with an automotive soap. One tablespoon of baking soda is sufficient to clean the undercarriage of most vehicles.  Leaving dried soap on your vehicle can also reduce the lifespan of the paint. Make sure you rinse all of the soap off of your car or truck each time you wash it. Never wash your vehicle in direct sunlight, as it may cause the soap to dry to the paint much faster.You may choose to apply soap to your vehicle in sections, such as the hood, then rinse it completely before moving on to the next portion of the vehicle. Dried soap will also dull the appearance of the paint on your vehicle.  Wax does more than provide your vehicle with a healthy shine, it also protects the paint from fading and damage. Applying a coat of wax to your vehicle twice a year will provide the paint with an extra layer of protection and help reduce the chances of rust forming.Wax repels water and creates another layer of protection for the paint. Wax will also protect your paint from fading in direct sunlight.	Wash your vehicle regularly. Wash the undercarriage of the vehicle. Use baking soda to neutralize road salt. Rinse the vehicle thoroughly. Wax your vehicle at least twice a year.
Craft or dollar stores are great places to find artificial flowers.; , With a pair of scissors, cut the stem off of the fake flower. You want to make sure to cut enough off so that you are now working with a flat surface.  Let the glue heat up for a few minutes before working with it.    Press it against the base of a blank pin for 15 seconds. If you want something for your hair instead, glue the flower onto a plain barrette. Depending on the size of the pin or barrette you get, you may be able to fit more than one flower onto your new accessory. , After the flower is attached to the pin or barrette, decorate your flower as desired.   Use the hot glue gun for this as well. Be creative! If you'd like, glue on sequins, beads or crystals to the fabric of the flower or to the remainder of the pin or barrette. ,	Assemble the items. Trim the stem. Prepare the glue. Glue on the base of the flower. Let the glue dry for several hours before wearing.  , Decorate. Let the glue dry again for a few hours before wearing.  , Finished.
Acting classes will help you discover your strengths as an actress. Some actresses excel at drama, while others are natural comedians. You might discover that performing Shakespeare is your calling, or that musical theatre is for you. In any case, acting classes teach you to develop and inhabit your character, work with other actors and take direction.   Improvisation classes are a good place to start. Many people immediately think of comedy when they hear the word "improv," but improvisation classes actually teach essential skills for dramatic acting, too. Improvisational acting trains you to pay attention to cues and respond quickly. You'll learn to naturally react to others' prompts and silence your inner critic. Acting workshops will help you understand the craft of acting from a different angle, through "scene studies." Typically, you'll be assigned a few parts in from a few scenes, which you'll practice over an entire semester. You'll participate in class discussions about the meaning of the scene and the intentions of the screenwriter or playwright. Finally, you'll be subject to critiques, and you'll be able to put the skills that you learn into practice right away. When you advance past basic acting classes, you'll have the option to take specialized classes for film or stage acting, which require different skills. Experiment with both to figure out which suits you best. You may enroll in an acting program at a university and pursue a degree in acting, but if you're not ready to commit to an intensive program yet, try taking a few classes at your local community college or theater arts school.; , There are numerous approaches to acting, each of which offer insight and training into accessing and portraying emotion.   The Stanislavski Method is a step-by-step method to building character, and includes script analysis. Stanslavski-trained actresses include Stella Adler and Marilyn Monroe. The Meisner Technique focuses on action-based character development and actor response. Meisner actresses include Tina Fey, Jessica Walter and Naomi Watts. Method Acting involves adopting the behaviors and mindset of your character, and immersing yourself in your character for the duration of the production. Method actresses include Kate Winslet, Natalie Portman and Tippi Hedren.  Once you’ve identified your strengths as an actress and the type of career you’d like to pursue, study the greats. If you want to work in the film industry, watch movies with stars like Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Judi Dench. If sketch comedy is your goal, catch up on shows like Saturday Night Live. And if you’d like to be a stage actress, visit your local theatre and take in plays regularly.  Your daily interactions offer great training. Studying emotional responses to various situations helps you develop your emotional range, while studying facial expressions, speech patterns and body language gives you ideas and tools for creating character and for performance.  You never know when there’s going to be a casting call for an actress who speaks French, plays the piano, juggles or does back-flips. It’s good to have an arsenal of unique talents with which you can distinguish yourself. Likewise, you might find that you can use them to give a character depth and dimension.  There many fantastic books that offer invaluable advice for aspiring and working actors. These books include:    The Intent to Live, by Larry Moss  Audition, by Michael Shurtleff  An Actor Prepares, by Constantin Stanislavski	Enroll in acting classes. Explore acting techniques. Study female roles. People watch. Develop your unique skill and talents. Read up on acting.
; , Turn the valve all the way clockwise, or pull the lever back.  Slide the knob on the round side of the box all the way to front.  Quickly pull down on the cable (or push the lever) twice in quick succession to make the steam whistle sound out two short blasts.  The top one must be moved from right to left to release the brakes on the engine.  Grip it firmly and give it a yank towards you. As you feel the engine move slightly, shove it back in most of the way, so that it does not gather speed too fast. Gradually open throttle as the locomotive approaches track speed. Observe cylinder cock exhaust and close them when only steam is emitted. Move the Johnson bar slowly back toward vertical, but never too close to vertical. This is like the gear shift of your car and admits less steam per cylinder stroke. In turn, this increases the efficiency of steam usage so you don't over work the poor guy throwing coal into the fire (and to conserve fuel and water!) If the locomotive's wheels slip, close throttle most of the way immediately. Allowing the wheels to slip will not render any tractive effort and will damage the locomotive's driving (powered) wheels if done continuously (also "tears" holes in a coal fired locomotive, or in an oil burning locomotive, can cause hollow booms much like an explosion). Wheelslip, as it's called, may cause excess damage if allowed for too long. This includes damage to the firebox itself, which may or may not result in the locomotive exploding. Blow the whistle and ring bell at all crossings of all types and DO NOT EXCEED TRACK SPEED. That is very dangerous, as derailments due to excess speed may occur, even on straight track. This too can cause boiler explosions. See the Wreck of the Old 97 for example.	Push the reverser/Johnson bar forward - grip the very large lever that rises from near the floor in front or beside you, squeeze the release handle and shove it all the way forward, and let go of the release handle to lock it into place. Open the cylinder cocks - find a medium size valve in front of you on the boiler, or a thin lever on the floor in front of you. Turn the front headlight on - above you on the ceiling, there will be a large, flat, half-round box or on the side of the cab wall . Blow the whistle code for forward movement - there will be either a cable, cables or whistle handles, above your head or in front of you on the boiler. Release the engine brakes - two brass horizontal levers will be near your left hand. Open the throttle to start the engine moving - the very long lever close to your face and hanging from the cab roof is the throttle.
You can also chop up a stump to remove it. To use this removal method, you will need a stump grinder. You can rent one from a home improvement store. This machine has a rotary cutter that will drill into and grind up the stump. It's a good method to use if you have a huge, stubborn stump you need to remove. Renting a stump grinder is probably the most prudent option, but if you have a lot of stumps to grind, it might be worth it to buy one.Get protective equipment, too. Goggles and a mask will protect you from sawdust and flying wood chips. If you don't enjoy handling heavy machinery, call a local landscaper and explain that you have a stump that needs to be removed. You'll be able to pay someone else to do it.  Use a chainsaw to level off the stump just a few inches from the ground. Remove any branches or roots that stick up too far off the ground so that the stump grinder will have a stable surface on which to operate.  Put on your goggles and mask, and position the stump grinder over the stump. Then, following the manufacturer’s instruction, move the grinder slowly across the stump's surface to grind it up to bits. Continue along the arial roots to grind those as well until the stump has been fully ground up.          Be careful not to get your feet in the way of the grinder. Wear heavy boots so you won't accidentally hurt yourself. Make sure children and pets are safely away from the equipment before you begin operating it.  Remove all of the wood chips and discard them (or use them as mulch, then fill in the hole with soil.          You might need to use an ax to chop out remaining roots.	Get a stump grinder. Cut the stump close to the ground. Grind up the stump. Shovel out the grindings and fill in the hole.
The wave is a classic hip hop dance move originated with B-Boys and break dancing. You don’t need to listen to early hip-hop to do the wave, but it doesn’t hurt. If you want to listen to the authentic stuff, put on Funk You Up by The Sequence.   You could also listen to contemporary rap or anything that has a groovy beat.  Hold your arms out so you’re making a “T” shape with your body.Be sure that you stay loose while extending your arms. Dancing is all about staying loose.  While in the “T” position, attempt to relax your shoulders. Don’t drop your arms, but try to rest the shoulder muscles. Your arms should be able to still hold with relaxed shoulders.  Start with your right arm and flop it down so that your fingers point to the floor while your elbow points up. You could also begin by pointing your hand up and your elbow down.   Feel free to start with your left arm, if that feels more comfortable.  Imagine the crest or trough of the wave must move through your arms.Move the wave through your shoulders. The key is for one shoulder to move up and have the other down. Then, as you move the wave you will switch shoulders.   The shoulder that was down will go up and the one up will move down., Once the wave passes through your shoulders, it must enter through your other arm. Once the shoulder is up, move the elbow down and move the wave into your hand. When the wave is in your hand, your hand is up while your elbow is down.  Once you’ve sent the wave through one arm, it must return to the “T” shape. Only keep your arm in position until the wave comes back to this arm.  Practice sending the wave to both sides and then reverse the process. You may need to practice a few times before you can send the wave through your arms and reverse.The key is to move with the music. The aforementioned song is slow enough that you can practice each piece of the wave.	Choose the music. Position your arms. Relax your shoulders. Start the pulse. Move the pulse. Continue moving the wave. Bring your arm to equilibrium. Practice the movement.
Soak the seeds for twelve hours in a small bowl of water. Put some moistened sand, sphagnum moss or peat moss in a container with a removable lid, such as a yogurt container.You can purchase night blooming jasmine from online seed retailers. You may be able to find them at your local garden center.; , Cover the seeds with 1 1/16’’ (26.9 mm) of soil. Put the container in your fridge for between one and two months. After this preparation period, which is called stratification, the seeds will be ready for planting.The seeds should be kept at a temperature of between 30 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (between -1 and -4 Celsius). Every week, check the container to make sure the soil is slightly damp but not too moist. If the soil is dry, you should spray a bit of water into the container. You can put one packet of seeds into the container. At the stratification stage, the seeding density is not a major concern, as long as all of the seeds are exposed to a cold and damp environment.  Use small, four inch (10 centimeter) pots with potting soil or peat pots. Mist the pots with a plant sprayer. Place two seeds down into each of the small pots. Gently press them down, and then mist the pots with a sprayer., Place your small pots in a germination tray or a shallow container. You can place a plastic bag over the tray but remember to leave one side open for ventilation. Keep the tray at a temperature of between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (16 and 21 Celsius) to allow for germination. You should see the seedlings begin to emerge after two or three weeks, at which point you can remove the plastic bag., Place your tray of seedlings in a warm spot in the house, such as in front of a south facing window. If you have a grow light, you can use it for this purpose. Try to make sure the seedlings get 10 to 12 hours of sunlight per day. When they reach a height of between three and four inches (7 and 10 centimeters), you can go ahead and plant the seedlings.Remember to make sure you are past the last frost date in your region. You can find out the last frost date by visiting either a gardening or a weather website and searching by zipcode. Alternately, you can call the weather service of your local environment agency.  When they reach 3-4 inches (7 and 10 centimeters) in height, you can plant your seedlings outside. Find a nice place to plant your seedlings in the garden, along a pathway or in a container. If you plant the seedlings in your garden, remember that they will need a sunny spot and a bit of room to grow. You should space them between 4 and 6 feet (1.2 and 1.8 meters) apart from one another.If you choose a pot, find a 75 liter (20 gallon) container with lots of drainage holes and a quick draining medium at the bottom such as stones.Fill the container with rich, loose soil., The night blooming jasmine is native to tropical America and the West Indies. It will not tolerate harsh, cold climates. If you live in a warmer climate, you can go ahead and plant it outdoors.If you get a lot of frost in your region, you might want to bring it indoors during the winter months.It will tolerate United States Department of Agriculture zones 8b, 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b, or 11., The night blooming jasmine enjoys full sun to partial shade. It will bloom very well when exposed to full sun, but can also tolerate some shade.It requires at least four hours of sunlight., The night blooming jasmine will do fine in a range of soil types. However, the soil should be rich in nutrients and drain well, since you don’t want the roots to become waterlogged.The soil should be a neutral pH of between 6.6 and 7.5.Use a soil pH test kit from your home garden center. Dig a four inch (10 centimeter) hole. Pour some distilled water in the hole. Insert the test probe, which is included in your kit, into the hole. After one minute, you will get a pH reading.If the soil pH is not amenable to planting night blooming jasmine, you should plant it in a different part of your garden or someplace with a better soil pH. It will do well in a sandy soil., Dig a hole in your garden, which should be large enough to contain the night blooming jasmine seedling. Holding the night blooming jasmine by the root ball, gently place it in the hole. Cover the planting with soil.Place night blooming jasmine at least three feet away from walkways and buildings.  When the top of the soil looks dry, give the plants a good watering.During the first year of the plant’s life, water thoroughly and regularly.Water the night blooming jasmine when the soil looks dry.The frequency of watering will depend on your local climate. You should water more frequently during the spring and summer months.If you are watering the jasmine in a pot, you should stop watering when you see the water draining from the bottom., Dissolve a half teaspoon of 15-15-15 fertilizer in a gallon of water. Pour the mixture over the base of the plant.If the plant is suffering, you can also feed it with a fish emulsion fertilizer during the winter months. Use a half teaspoon (2.46 milliliters) of fish emulsion with a quart of water. Use one cup (236 millilitres) for each foot of the plant. 15-15-15 fertilizer contains a balanced mix of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium., To encourage new growth and contain their growth, prune night blooming jasmine in the late fall or early spring. Trim the plants back to around three feet (91 centimeters) in height.In order to avoid spreading any disease, it is wise to clean your pruning tools in a bleach solution. You can use a mix of one-part bleach to six parts water.  In the fall, you should bring the pot of night blooming jasmine onto your porch. As soon as you see the temperatures begin to drop anywhere close to 0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit), you may want to bring the night blooming jasmine indoors. As long as you place it near a sunny window and keep the temperature between 70 and 80 Fahrenheit (21–26 Celsius), it should continue to bloom.	Soak the seeds. Press the seeds down into the container. Plant the seeds in potting soil. Germinate the seeds in a tray. Give the seedlings 10-12 hours of sunlight per day. Plant them outside when they reach an adequate height. Make sure the last frost has passed. Choose a sunny spot. Plant jasmine in rich, well-draining soil. Transplant the night blooming jasmine. Water night blooming jasmine until the soil is saturated. Fertilize night blooming jasmine between late spring and late fall. Prune night blooming jasmine in the fall or spring. Put them near a sunny window for the winter months.
If you love romance, mystery, or something else entirely, you can find an anime about it! There are many different individual genres of anime, but it is also roughly grouped into four main sections by age and gender (not that you should ever let that should stop you if it sounds like something you'd like to watch!)  Shoujo - intended for girls up to the age of 18 Shounen - intended for boys up to the age of 18 Josei - intended for girls over the age of 18 Seinen - intended for boys over the age of 18; , Once you've decided on a genre, see if you can find a list of recommendations. You probably won't have exactly the same taste as the person who made the list, but you can get some good ideas about which anime to try out.  If you're a person who can't watch an anime if the drawings are really bad or not your style, then don't! Drawing styles vary depending on the author, genre and when it was drawn.  They're well-known for a reason! You can start off with the famous ones like Naruto or Bleach.  If you didn't really like it, at least watch the next episode to see if it picks up. Animes need second chances too!	Focus on the genre. Look up lists on the internet. Look at the style of drawing the author uses. Begin with the classics. Try the first episode.
If you need help, Google or post on a Facebook Group. There are thousands of people who would love to help you.; ,, Making sure that what you are doing is legal is essential. The rules vary region by region, so check your local drone/quad-copter regulations., Most people use 2.4ghz for control of the multi-rotor and so the only available legal frequency in the UK is 5.8ghz. It has a restriction though on power. The maximum for the TX is 25mw. This is ok if you have decent clover leaf antennas., Don't fly within five miles of an airport or near radio masts or power lines. Don't fly within 50 meters (160 ft) of any object or person that you don't have direct control over., This requires a license.  There are too many regulations to list, do a quick Google. The CAA govern all of this in the UK. There are different regulation for different parts of the country as well. Check with the local council about what you are doing.   Note: Do not attempt to fly FPV without extensive knowledge of flying. ,,,,  Then Using the left stick (Mode 2) Push it to the right or the left and a little up.	Check that all your supplies are compatible.Assemble it. Check legality. Adjust your frequency. Use common sense. Don't take pictures of anyone and sell them. Power up the multi-rotor and the goggles/monitor.Slowly throttle up and take off.Then, slowly use the roll, pitch and yaw to fly around carefully.Watch closely through the goggles and fly.Take it slow at first. To do a roll, first ensure you are on high rates.
While both Epcot is educating the viewer with real-life situations and about a person's normal environment, both Disney's Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom both have standpoints much the same (though one is focused on the movies and the other on animals). The Magic Kingdom is focused on educational views, but in a fantasy-faire way.; , While Magic Kingdom tends to be more fun than any of the other parks for those willing to stand the crowds, other parks can have just the same amount of fun if you know where (good clean) "fun" exists.  While Early Magic Hours takes people away from certain parks when Disney expects to see massive hordes of people, it draws that out on other parks. Crowds will be focused more around the younger set at both Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom and the older crowds at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot.  While each park (except Epcot) has at least one, the park with the most thrill in their roller coaster is Space Mountain in the Magic Kingdom (though some people may beg to differ). Reports have been shown throughout websites and in many books including the Unofficial Guides books that Space Mountain trumps the others any day of the year (and in some can sometimes be too much excitement).  While Epcot is set up in two moon-like circles around two famous circular shapes (World Showcase Lagoon and the Epcot(Spaceship Earth) ball), each of the other 3 theme parks have only one real central locale and has several lands traveling around the hub location.  None of the others have this setup; once you're through the gates, the whole park is at your fingertips just by walking (no alternate forms are needed to get from the parking lot and entrance to the park itself. , While the Magic Kingdom is by far the oldest(first opened in 1971), Animal Kingdom (opened in 1998) is by far the youngest of the 4 parks.  Between the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean and it's a small world and the Enchanted Tiki Room, there's no way to resist not going to this park on any Disney World vacation.  While at any given time and day parades could be yanked from the lineup, the two theme parks that don't have parades include Epcot and Animal Kingdom (one was the result of the parade being retired as of earlier 2014 and the other being the result of a retiring and non-replacement in the early 2000s). Most other parks contain at least 1 parade showing, if not 2 per day.  Each theme park is different, but each theme park's lots are based on what the visitor is intending to see.  No matter what park you use, you still have to pay the same admission fee. However, if you exit one parking lot and try to reenter another on the same day, keep your ticket and show it to the nice parking lot attendant and they'll gladly admit you to the parking lots with no additional charge (show your parking lot ticket and you'll be scott free to get in to two different parks on the same day).	Look at the parks from an educational standpoint. Look at the parks from a "fun-like" perspective. Try to compare the crowds. Look for excitement in roller coasters in some parks more than others. Look at the setup of each park. Look towards the travel arrangements between the Ticket and Transportation Center (parking lot for the Magic Kingdom) and the Magic Kingdom itself to be a comparison. Look for kid-like bright cheery colors at the entrance to Magic Kingdom, whereas all the others tend to be less bright and more adult-like in taste.  , Look towards the history of the parks. Look for classic theme rides to exist at the Magic Kingdom. Think in terms of parades. Look towards the differences in the lot names of each theme park. Don't think that by going to any one park the parking info will be any cheaper.

If you want to stay warm while saving money on heating bills, invest in an electric blanket or heating pad that you can sit on or wrap around yourself as you snuggle on the couch or work at your computer. This will not only save money, but can prevent power outages in cold areas where everyone is using his or her thermostat.You can find fairly efficient warming mats for outdoor pets. Place the warming mat on your chair and a wool blanket over your lap to create a warmer environment. At night, use a hot water bottle. You can purchase them for $10 or less online. Also, wearing an extra layer of clothing, such as leggings under your pants, or a wool sweater, can go a long way in keeping you warm inside your own home. Instead of turning your thermostat up higher, turn it on earlier to give your house time to heat up. You may be making it hotter than necessary because you want your home to get warm as soon as possible.  Hot water and broth raise the temperature of your hands as you hold the bowl or cup. Then they heat your body from the inside for 30 minutes. Drink a cup of tea in the morning to get warm as you get out of bed and include soup into your lunch or dinner plans.  High protein levels and healthy fats increase circulation. People with low iron levels should take extra care to eat foods rich in protein and improve their circulation.   You should also consider throwing some ginger into that nutty trail mix. Ginger has been shown to get blood circulation going and to raise your temperature as well., Exercise also improves your circulation. Whether you exercise at home, in a gym or in the snow, doing 30 minutes per day will keep you warmer inside and out. This will keep your body temperature higher than normal even after you have finished your workout., If you're feeling cold, just cuddle up on the couch with your loved one, spending some time getting close. Just the act of snuggling and touching another person creates warmth. Soon, you'll stop feeling chilly and will feel your body -- and your heart -- getting warmer.  Studies show that the body temperature naturally lowers when you get ready for bed, so you can counteract this by taking a nice warm bath a few hours before bed to raise your body temperature. If you take a warm bath right before bed, it might actually make your body temperature too hot, leading to a restless sleep, but taking a warm bath a few hours before sleeping should do the trick., One study found that being by yourself literally makes you colder, and that spending time with friends will help you get warmed up. The next time you're deciding between a date at home with your electric blanket and a day out with your friends, decide in your friends' favor if you want to stay warm.	Heat yourself, instead of heating the room. Make soup and tea a regular part of your diet. Eat nuts. Work out. Snuggle with your loved one. Take a warm bath. Spend time with friends.
Mix one cup linseed oil, four tablespoons of carnauba wax, two tablespoons of beeswax, and half a cup of apple cider vinegar. Put the ingredients over boiling water by using a double boiler. Heat the wax, and stir frequently until the waxes have melted.         Carnauba wax can be bought at auto stores. If you don’t have a double boiler, put the ingredients in a clean tin can. Set the can in middle of a pot of boiling water. Be careful not to scald yourself when removing the can.  Once the waxes have melted into one another, you should pour the wax into a different container, such as a jar or Pyrex measuring cup. Let the wax cool until it is solid. Once the wax is solid, it is ready to be used.          If you use a container with a lid, you can save the cooled wax for later.  Once the wax is cool, you can scoop it up with a clean cloth. Apply it to the headlights. Work it across the entire headlight using circular motions.  With a different cloth, buff off the wax. Make sure that there are no streaks or residue left on afterwards. The headlight should look polished and sparkling.	Heat the wax. Let the wax cool in a separate container. Rub wax onto headlights. Remove wax with a clean cloth.
The most iconic disco decoration is the disco ball. They produce moving white dots of light when a spotlight is projected on their surface. You can easily find a disco ball online, or make one of your own.  Note that disco balls come in all sorts of sizes. If you’re hoping to fill a living or dining room with moving white dots, get a ball that’s about 12 in (30 cm) diameter. For a larger room, get a roughly 20 in (50 cm) disco ball.; , The disco lighting effect is amplified if you mount the ball on a motor that rotates the ball and moves the dots of light around the room. You can purchase disco balls that come with a motor, or purchase the motor separately online.Be sure to get a motor that can handle the size and weight of your ball. Some motors are designed for small disco balls, while others can handle larger ones.  Choose a location near the middle of the room that has a horizontal surface you can attach the motor too, such as the ceiling. If the motor is powered by a plug, plan the route that the cord will take. Most disco ball motors will mount to the ceiling with screws. Keep in mind that there will also be a light aimed at the disco ball, so there must also be an appropriate space to hang a light that will point at the ball.  There are specific lights designed for use with a disco ball, but many different spotlights will work. The important factor is that the light is focused, or pointed in a particular direction like a spotlight. The effect will be even better if you are able to point two spotlights at the ball from different directions.You can mount the spot lights in many different ways. If you get a spotlight specifically for this purpose, it may even attach to the disco ball's base. It may also have a base of its own that you attach to the ceiling separately. The ideal distance between the mirrored ball and the spotlight depends on the size of the ball, as well as the size and strength of the light. Experiment with positioning the spotlight in different locations relative to the ball and mount it where it provides the desired effect.  Some spotlights have features that supplement the lighting effect that is made by the disco ball. For instance, you can get a spotlight that rotates through different colored filters, so that the dots of light moving around the room change color periodically.	Get or make a mirrored ball. Consider getting a disco ball motor. Hang the motor from the ceiling. Position one or two spotlights pointing at the disco ball. Get a disco-specific spotlight.
As mentioned in the introduction, there are plenty of alternate ways of getting somewhere. Think about whether it might be possible to walk, bike, or take a bus, train, cab, or rideshare. If none of these options are available to you, or they would require unreasonable hardship, then you might consider asking someone for a lift. A good rule of thumb when asking someone a favor is to make sure that the benefit to you significantly outweighs the inconvenience it might cause the other person.; , While whether or not someone owns or has easy access to a car is the first thing you should consider when deciding to ask for a ride, don’t make assumptions about their availability or willingness. Even if they’ve given you a ride once, twice, or a hundred times before, don’t take it for granted that they’ll be able to help you every time you need to get somewhere.  If you have a relationship with someone where you’re already in the practice of regularly doing favors for each other, such as those that are common between family members, romantic partners, or close friends, this is ideal. Otherwise, consider who might be least inconvenienced by your request.   If you need a ride home from work, consider asking the coworker that you know drives by your street every day, anyway. Or if you are going to dinner with a group of friends, maybe ask the friend that lives closest to you for a lift to the restaurant. Make sure you consider lifestyle factors, too. If you have a friend with two small children, or who’s been working a lot of overtime lately, they will likely need to be more conservative with their extra time and energy than your friend who teaches guitar lessons three afternoons a week and still lives with his parents. If your cousin wakes up early every morning for her job, you probably don’t want to ask her for a ride to the airport to catch your red eye flight. Or a friend who works as a bartender probably won’t be very excited about bringing you to pick up your car from the body shop at seven a.m. on a Saturday. It’s extremely important that you know the other person well enough to be sure you feel safe spending time alone with them. It’s never a good idea to get into a car with a near-stranger, or someone with whom you don’t feel comfortable.  When you’ve decided whom you’ll ask, you’ll want to be forthcoming about your intentions at the beginning of the conversation. If you try to make small talk about other things first the entire conversation can come off as disingenuous when you finally come around to the point. It’s also a good idea to begin the conversation with something along the lines of “Hi so-and-so, I have a favor to ask you…”. Not only is this appropriately straightforward, but using the word “favor” also shows that you understand the person would be going our of their way for you, whereas “Could you please give me a ride to work tomorrow?” could run the risk of sounding like a command, and therefore off-putting. , If you know you are going to need a ride somewhere, don’t wait until the last minute to ask. Give the other person as much advance notice as possible, so that they can factor it into their schedule that day.   This also goes for asking for a ride in front of other people. Many people have a difficult time saying no if there is an audience, and they might suspect that you are capitalizing on this.  While this is recommended any time you take a ride from someone, it is an absolute must in the instance that someone is picking you up and bringing you somewhere they don’t also need to be, such as the airport, a doctor’s appointment, or a job interview.   Often people will refuse to take your money, but don’t count on this! Make sure you have cash on had to give them, just in case.  If someone says they’re unable to give you a ride, don’t press the issue. Resist asking for an explanation, and don’t argue or challenge them. Instead, be gracious and thank them for their time.  Putting in a little extra time and effort on your end shows the person that you are taking their time and effort into consideration, and that you value the favor they are doing for you. Here are a few examples of ways you might make the experience easier for them:   If your destination is a place regularly frequented by most people, such as the grocery store, offer to accompany them whenever they are next planning to go, rather than requesting they make a special trip. If you live at the corner of a difficult intersection, offer to walk a block or two in order to meet them where it’s easier to pull over. If they are giving you a ride somewhere that they may have never been before, make sure you have clear directions, or have the address already plugged into the map function on your smart phone. Be ready to go at least five minutes before you expect them to show up, so that they won’t have to wait for you in the instance that they are running a few minutes ahead of schedule.  Try to make the other person’s experience of being in the car with you as enjoyable as possible. This is not only respectful, but it will also increase the likelihood of this person agreeing to help you in the future. Often being pleasant is just a matter of not doing certain annoying things:   Don’t criticize the person’s car, for instance, no matter how beat up or messy it is. Don't criticize their driving, and avoid being a "backseat driver". Don’t fiddle with any of the car’s dials. Even if they are listening to most boring talk radio station ever, or the air conditioning is freezing your face off. If you absolutely must, ask the driver politely if they'd be willing to change the radio station or turn the air down. Don’t be a chatterbox. If the other person wants to talk, that’s great! But if they don’t seem like they are interested in chatting, let yourself be comfortable with the silence. Some people need quiet in order to concentrate while they drive, or they might be particularly interested in what they’re listening to on the radio.  While you might not be able to pay the person back in kind, you should still find a way to show your appreciation. What this entails exactly will depend on your preexisting relationship with the person, and the degree of inconvenience to them.   If you get a ride home from a coworker who lives in the same building as you, a simple text saying “Thanks again for the ride! I really appreciate it!” might suffice. But if a friend wakes up at three thirty in the morning to drive you an hour to the airport, you probably want to consider something a little more meaningful. Perhaps you can pick them up a small gift on your trip, or treat them to dinner when you get back. However, if you are dealing with prohibitive financial issues and can’t afford a gift or dinner, a thoughtful, hand-written thank you card will work, too. Make sure to do this after they have agreed to help you, as otherwise it can seem like you’re trying to obligate them. For instance, don’t bake your friend cookies and as she’s biting into the first one, ask her for a ride to the dentist next Friday.	Make sure you’ve first considered other options. Don’t assume that just because someone has a car, they can give you a ride. Decide whom you’ll ask. Don’t beat around the bush. Don’t put them on the spot. Offer to help pay for gas. Take no for an answer. Make it as easy as possible for the person who is giving you the ride. Be pleasant in the car. Plan to reciprocate.
Visit a hardware or home and garden store to find the raw lumber required to fashion the wooden cages. For this project, you will need two 2x2x8’ boards, along with three 1x2x8’ pieces. The wood will require a few simple cuts to form the different parts of the tomato cage.Wood is generally cheaper and easier to find than other materials like concrete wire and livestock paneling. Because it is an organic material, wood is less durable than metal. You should get plenty of use out of wooden tomato cages, but don’t expect them to last as long as cages constructed from metal wire or paneling.  Cut each of the 2x2x8’ boards perfectly in half. You should now have four 2x2x4’ pieces. These will serve as the upright supports for the cage. Cut the 1x2x8’ boards into sections that are 18” and 19.5” long. You should have six of each of these pieces total. They will act as the rungs for the upright supports.Make all the necessary cuts first. Then, all that’s left to do is nail or screw the pieces together. You will have some wood left over after cutting the 1x2x8’ boards. The leftover wood can be saved for future projects or used elsewhere in your garden.  Using a nail gun or wood screws, attach three of the 1x2 rungs to two of the 2x2 legs to make a basic ladder construction. The rungs should be placed roughly 15” apart, starting at the top of the ladder and leaving space at the bottom for the supports to be driven into the ground. Repeat this process to craft the other side of the cage. Then, attach both ladders by securing three 19.5” sections of 1x2 lumber perpendicularly to the sides.The 19.5” sections will overlap the ends of the ladder construction, including the 18” rungs you attached previously.  Position the wooden cage over a tomato plant. Press down firmly to mark where the legs are to go in the soil. Dig a small hole for each leg, about 4” deep. Set the legs of the cage down into the holes and fill in the space around them with loose soil. This process will result in a single tomato cage.If you’re planning on making multiple cages, take an assembly-line approach. Do all of your measuring and marking at once, followed by all your cutting, then screwing or nailing. You can also drive the cage into the ground using a hammer or mallet, being careful not to damage the structure. It may help to sharpen the legs or cut them into points first.	Buy the lumber for the cage. Cut the supports and rungs for the cage. Screw the assembly together. Place the cage over your tomato plants.
A traditional eyepatch is made out of black cloth. You can use the cloth of your choice. A popular material is canvas, but this isn’t the most comfortable. You could instead use a fabric that is soft like cotton, if you plan to wear the patch for an extended time period.You can also gather scrap cardboard if you choose to use it.; , Use a ruler to measure one of your eyes and the surrounding area. Most eyepatches will extend from your eyebrows to below your eyes. Measure from your eyebrows to the top of your cheek bone for the vertical distance. Then measure from the center of your nose to the other side of your eye for the horizontal distance. Jot these measurements down on paper.   After gauging how large you want your eyepatch, measure and draw the dimensions onto the cloth. You can use chalk to best see your outline.Create a sunglass lens shape out of the rectangle. Be sure to hit the edges of the rectangle when drawing your outline.  Use sewing scissors to cut out your eyepatch.Once you have your patch cut, use a lighter to burn away any of the frayed strings left behind. Removing the frayed strings will create a cleaner looking eyepatch.  To create a stiff eyepatch that will look dramatic, you can attach a piece of cardboard to the backside of the eyepatch. Lay the eyepatch onto a piece of clean cardboard. Then trace the patch onto the cardboard using a pen. Now cut out the cardboard.   Glue the patch onto the cardboard using standard glue or a hot glue gun. Use more fabric than is needed to completely cover the cardboard, and curl the excess fabric onto the back side of the cardboard so that the front of the patch is seamless. This isn't necessary, but it might look more believable than just using cloth.  Use a seamstress’ measuring tape to measure your head. Take note of your dimensions. When preparing the string you should leave extra slack to account for attaching and adjustments.  Use black string for an authentic look. Measure out your string to the same length you documented for your head. Remember to leave about two inches of slack for tying knots and adjustments.   If black string isn't available, use whatever you have. Darker colors work best.  Some hair ties will work as a string for your eyepatch. If you find that your hair tie is too small, use a headband. Cut whichever type of band you use so that it is in the shape of a string.   You can also rip an elastic band out of an old pair of pants.  Before attaching the string to the eyepatch, try wearing it by using your hands to hold everything in place. This will help you gauge if the string is the right dimension.   Make adjustments if needed., You can either create a hole to tie the string, or glue the string onto the patch. If you decide to make inserts into the patch, use a sharp knife. Create small holes on the far left and right side of the patch.   If you decide to glue, prepare a hot glue gun or superglue., Tie a small overhand knot if you created holes. Make sure you took into account the slack needed to attach the string. Use a hot glue gun or superglue to attach the string. Glue your string behind the front of the patch to create a sleeker look., Eyepatches are classic accessories for a variety of costumes. Slip the eyepatch over your head and you have your very own eyepatch.   For decorations, you can color onto the patch using a white marker. A classic costume decor is the pirates flag.	Gather your cloth. Measure the dimensions. Cut the outline. Use cardboard for support. Measure your head. Prepare the string. Use a hair tie. Test it on yourself. Prepare a hole. Attach the string. Wear the patch.
The largest pumpkins balloon out from the vine. Vines generally have two to three pumpkins. Once your pumpkins have reached the size of a softball, select the one on a vine that looks the most promising. You will have to cut out the others as they will steal nutrients from the prize pumpkin., Pumpkin vines grow roots at every leaf. Tearing out the roots nearest to the pumpkin will allow the pumpkin a bit of wiggle room. If the vine is held down by the roots near the pumpkin, the pumpkin might accidentally tear itself away from the vine as it grows massive. This would effectively end any more growth.   Train vines away from the pumpkin. While growing, the pumpkin could accidentally crush the vines near it.       Make sure to weed the area completely as your pumpkin vine grows. Once it reaches twenty feet and has covered the garden with leaves, you shouldn't have to weed anymore.  Only do this when the primary vine has reached 20 feet (6.1 m) in length. Pinching off the ends and side shoots will guarantee that the vine’s nutrients will go to your pumpkin.   To increase the chance of a prize-winning pumpkin, shape the vine into a triangle. Treat the base of the vine as the bottom of the pyramid. You can cut the secondary side shoots shorter and shorter as they grow farther away from the base. For example, the shoots growing closest to the base might be twelve feet long; the next set of shoots might be ten feet long, then eight feet and so on., You can either drape a sheet over it or build a small structure to hold a tarp up over the pumpkin. That said, try not shade too many of the leaves. These need sunlight to grow the pumpkin., Only do this if it is a dry season. Pumpkins do most of their growing at night. Water in the early evening so that the leaves and soil are not wet overnight. Try to avoid getting water on the leaves because wet leaves are more susceptible to disease., If you notice insects or other pests in your garden, research what they are, and take appropriate measures to control them. Growing flowers and herbs near your pumpkin patch can attract predator insects that naturally keep pests down.  Common pumpkin pests include squash bugs, striped and spotted cucumber beetles, aphids, vine borers, wireworms, and six spotted leafhoppers., Your pumpkins will be ready to harvest when they are a solid, deep color (and they are gigantic!) The rind should be hard. The vines will usually be dying back at this time.	Pick your prize pumpkin. Tear out the roots that are close to the pumpkin. Pinch off the ends and side shoots. Give the pumpkin shade. Give each plant 15 to 20 gallons (56.8 to 75.7 L) of water twice a week. Keep pests away. Harvest your pumpkins.
Realize that she was only 13 years old when she released Friday, and has since become remarkably known throughout America. Her mother spent $4,000 for her song to be made into a single and the same week it was released to the Internet.Although it was for all the wrong reasons, her single Friday went viral on YouTube, receiving over 167 million views before being taken off of YouTube due to, according to the video, copyright reasons. Additionally, it is possible that the video was removed from YouTube also due to negative/threatening comments and cyber-bullying, which had a very strong impact on Black's life,with the result of Black being homeschooled instead of being taught at a school.   Notice that not very long after removing Friday from YouTube, Rebecca Black re-posted the video on YouTube, despite influence to not repost the video. This can show that Rebecca Black was not afraid of threats and hatred.; , Although the lyrics are so simple and obvious that they're silly, think about how relatable they really are for teenagers. Everyone wakes up in the morning and has breakfast, and people do look forward to the weekend. Although the lyrics are repetitive, they ring true.  If you listen closely to the beats of the song and, you will realize what a creative song she created. The song uses an I-vi-IV-V chord progression. Many other popular songs have used this chord progression. "Friday" is performed in the key of B major with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. The familiar structure makes the song catchy.  Black used auto-tune in Friday, meaning that her voice was edited a lot. Realize that because of the excessive use of Auto-Tune, Rebecca's real voice is not portrayed in the song, so she is not necessarily as bad a singer as it seems. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with her musical talent because her voice was completely edited. Realize that if there hadn't been a use of auto-tune (or not as much of it), the song may have been better.  Black's following single, My Moment used little auto-tune compared to Friday. Possibly because of this, My Moment has a much better "like/dislike" ratio on YouTube than "Friday".  My Moment is about the fact that she didn't get discouraged from becoming a singer after all the "dislikes" that Friday received. Black states "this song is for you, haters". Admire the fact that instead of quitting singing for good, Rebecca Black decided to record another song, showing her determination.  Don't predetermine that you will hate Black's new music just because you hated Friday. Go in with an open mind and treat it like somebody else's song. Instead of thinking about Friday, think about only her new songs. Realize that Black's music shouldn't be hated just because of it's predecessor.  Rebecca Black is generally busy writing songs and preparing them for the public.    Person of Interest, which followed My Moment, was another single released by Rebecca Black.	Search for information about Rebecca Black and her music on the Internet. Realize the simple brilliance of the lyrics of Friday. Listen for patterns in her song. Think about the use of auto-tune. Understand that Rebecca Black learned from her mistakes with "Friday". Admire the meaning of My Moment. Listen to her new music with an open mind. Expect more singles and albums to be released.
A sure sign that there’s an issue with your vehicle’s cooling system is finding a puddle of coolant under your vehicle. Remember that there are a number of fluids in your engine that could feasibly leak, so check closely to confirm if the puddle you find is coolant, oil, or possibly even just water from running the air conditioner.Touch the puddle with your finger, then wipe it on a white sheet of paper to see what color it really is. If it is green or orange, it’s likely a coolant leak.; , If you believe your vehicle may be leaking coolant, check the coolant reservoir in the engine bay. Most coolant reservoirs have “fill lines” labeled on the container that will let you know if the coolant levels are low in your vehicle. Check the coolant level in your vehicle and top it off with a water/coolant mixture if it appears to be low. Check it again after a few days to see if the level has changed.Make sure to check the coolant levels with the vehicle at about the same temperature each time (either warm from driving or cool from sitting). Dropping coolant levels in conjunction with puddles means a coolant leak is very likely. Check in the owner's or service manual for your vehicle to locate the coolant reservoir if you are unsure of where to find it.  If your engine is low on coolant, or the coolant needs to be changed, it will struggle to maintain a proper running temperature. Keep your eye on the temperature gauge in your vehicle. If it begins to run consistently warmer, or begins to overheat sporadically, there is an issue with your cooling system.Failing to adequately cool your engine could mean your coolant levels are too low. Coolant can eventually go bad. If the coolant levels are still high but the engine is overheating, one issue may be that the coolant needs to be replaced. If you are uncertain of what the symbols on your gauges mean, refer to your vehicle's owner's manual to determine which is the temperature gauge.  If you suspect that your coolant system may be leaking, spray the engine with a hose to remove any existing signs of a leak. Then start your engine and visually inspect the engine bay, looking closely for signs of a leak. Coolant is usually under pressure, so a leak could spray out or it may only trickle. Wear safety glasses and exercise caution while looking around the engine bay with the engine running.Do not put your hands inside the engine bay with the engine running. Look for any new signs of coolant leaks then follow the coolant to the highest point to locate the crack or hole.  The coolant system is under pressure while heated and opening the radiator cap or petcock while the system is under pressure could result in serious burns. Allow the car to sit for a few hours to make sure it’s completely cool before coming into contact with any parts of the coolant system.After a few hours, lightly tap the top of the radiator to see if it is cool to the touch. If it’s warm, the coolant inside may still be quite hot. Opening the coolant system while hot will result in heated coolant spraying out, which is extremely dangerous.  In order to access the bottom of the radiator to drain the old coolant, you’ll need to raise the vehicle to a height that allows you to work and place a container beneath it to catch the draining fluid. Locate the designated jack points for your vehicle by consulting your owner’s manual to avoid doing any damage to the vehicle while you jack it up.Once the vehicle is high enough to slide your container underneath it, place jack stands beneath it to support the weight of the vehicle. Never work under a vehicle that is supported only by a jack. Jack stands will prevent the jack from losing pressure and lowering the vehicle while you’re beneath it.  Locate the petcock on the bottom portion of the radiator. The petcock often looks like a spout with a valve you can turn to open it, and it should be on or near the bottom of the radiator to allow it to drain. Once you have located it, make sure the container is positioned properly beneath it and open the valve.The coolant should be cool coming out of the radiator, but you should still take care to avoid letting it come into contact with your bare skin. Check your owner’s manual for the vehicle’s coolant capacity and make sure you have a container large enough to hold it all at least twice.  Once you’ve finished draining the radiator, there will still be a great deal of bad coolant remaining in the system. Close the petcock and fill the coolant reservoir with water. Start the engine and allow it to run for a few minutes before draining the radiator again. You should repeat this process two or three times.If you only allow the engine to run for a few minutes each time, it should not get too warm to drain the radiator. The water will flush out the rest of the bad coolant from the engine.  Most vehicles require a 50/50 water and coolant mixture to maximize the coolant system’s efficiency. You can purchase pre-mixed coolant, or choose to mix it yourself. Fill the reservoir until it is an inch above the “full” line, then start the engine. As it warms up, the thermostat will open, allowing coolant to flow in. As the coolant level drops in the reservoir, continue to add to it. Add the mixture to the radiator or reservoir until you reach the maximum suggested capacity.If you do not have your owner’s manual, check the vehicle manufacturer’s website for fluid capacities. It may take a few minutes for the coolant to drain into the system, so be patient as your pour the new coolant in. If your vehicle’s radiator has a bleeder valve on the top, open it and allow the engine to run for ten minutes to allow any excess air to escape.  A common point of failure on radiators is the cap itself. Radiator caps are designed to allow excess pressure to escape to avoid damage to the coolant system, but over time they can become oxidized, full of grime, or just worn out. To replace your radiator cap, simply wait for the engine to cool completely and twist the old cap off. Screw the replacement on in its place. You can purchase replacement radiator caps at your local auto parts store. Make sure to ask for a cap that fits your vehicle’s exact year, make and model.  Commercial leak sealants are sold at most auto parts stores and can help resolve a radiator leak if you’re in a bind. However, it’s important to note that these leak sealants aren’t designed to be permanent repairs. To use a leak sealant, simply open the radiator cap on a cool engine and pour it in. Top off the radiator with a coolant and water mixture if it is low as a result of the leak You will likely still need to locate and repair the leak, or replace the radiator after using a leak sealant. Leak sealant is a great option if you need to get your vehicle home or to a repair facility.  If you are able to locate a crack in your radiator, you may be able to repair it using an epoxy. First clean the area around the crack thoroughly, as any dirt or grease may prevent the epoxy from establishing a seal. Use a spray on brake cleaner and a rag to remove any stuck on grime, then allow the cleaned area to dry completely. Use your hands to knead the epoxy until it becomes malleable enough for you to spread it out over the entire crack.Allow the epoxy to set overnight before starting the vehicle. Radiator epoxy can be purchased at most auto parts stores.  If there is a crack in your radiator, it is highly likely that you may need to purchase a replacement for it. To replace your radiator, drain all of the fluids from it and disconnect the hoses leading into and out of the radiator. Unbolt the brackets that hold the radiator in place and slide it up and out of the front of your vehicle. Different vehicles will have different mounting hardware, but it’s common for radiators to be held in place by four to six bolts. Slide the new radiator into place and secure it using the same bolts.You may have to remove body or trim panels to access the radiator bolts or to remove the radiator from the vehicle. You can purchase a new radiator from the vehicle manufacturer or most auto parts stores.	Look for puddles beneath your vehicle. Check the coolant reservoir. Pay attention to changes in your temperature gauge. Visually inspect your engine bay. Allow the engine to cool completely. Jack up the vehicle. Open the petcock and drain the coolant into a container. Flush the radiator using a hose. Refill the radiator with a water and coolant mixture. Replace the radiator cap. Use a commercial leak sealant. Seal visible cracks with epoxy. Replace the radiator.
Trying to paint ceiling corners with a bunch of furniture in the way will only make a hard job even harder. Plus, you risk dripping paint on your furniture by accident. Pull furniture away from the walls and move it to the center of the room before you get started. If you’re painting the whole ceiling and not just the ceiling corners, remove your furniture to another room entirely., Lay blue painter’s tape along the entire perimeter of the wall where it meets the ceiling. This will prevent the paint you’re applying to the ceiling from accidentally getting on the wall., Lay down a drop cloth before you start working. If you don’t have a dropcloth, use an old set of sheets.If you’re only painting ceiling corners, you can probably get away with just laying down some thick cardboard or a layer of newspapers beneath the corner in question.  Painting ceiling corners can be messy. Wear heavy overalls or old clothes when painting. Do not wear new clothes or anything that you might be concerned about if it got paint on it.Disposable rubber gloves might also be useful. Wear a hat, too, to protect your head.  To start the process, dip a five or six-centimeter-wide (three-inch-wide) paintbrush into your paint of choice. Move the brush along the ceiling in one continuous direction, painting a six-centimeter (three-inch) margin of the ceiling.Use a ladder to reach the ceiling. Place your bucket of paint on top of it. If the ceiling corners you wish to paint are too tall to reach with a ladder, erect scaffolding. Paint the edge of the ceiling as thickly as possible without the paint dripping., When you reach the corner of the wall, begin painting another continuous margin along the adjoining wall, heading away from the corner. Use your paintbrush to paint this strip, too. This second margin along the ceiling should be just as wide as the first strip you painted., After painting a strip of paint across the entire perimeter of the ceiling, dip your loaded roller into the paint of your choice. Roll it towards the ceiling corner you’re interested in painting in such a way that it overlaps a bit with the area you just painted with the paintbrush. Roll in one direction toward the opposite side of the room.Do not place the roller directly overhead or you risk dripping paint on yourself. Use a roller with a nap of more than ½ inch (one centimeter)., You’ll be able to tell that you need more paint on your loaded roller when you notice that it is no longer applying paint to the ceiling. When this happens, dip – but do not submerge – your roller in paint., After your first corner has been painted, paint the ceiling in strips that touch each other, and that run parallel to the direction in which you painted the first corner. For instance, if you painted the ceiling corner by pushing the loaded roller from the front to the back of your room, continue applying paint by moving the loaded roller along a front-to-back axis.In this way, you’ll paint two corners, then the rest of the ceiling, then the final two corners.  As you paint the ceiling, step back and examine your progress. Look for areas where the paint has been applied unevenly (that is, areas where the paint is too light). Roll the loaded roller across these areas when you detect them., If you decide to apply a second coat, use the same method you did the first time – use the loaded roller to apply the paint in parallel strips – but move in a direction perpendicular to the strips you applied the first time.	Remove any furniture that you can from the room. Tape the edges of the wall. Protect your floor. Wear old clothes or overalls. Use a paintbrush to paint towards the corner. Paint away from the corner. Paint toward the corner with a loaded roller. Reload your roller with paint as needed. Move in parallel strips to cover the ceiling. Evaluate your work regularly. Let the paint dry before deciding if it needs another coat.
A clear parking area will allow you to freely move around your car to fill up tires without anything getting in the way. Parking on a level surface will make it easier for you to balance and operate your pump.   If you don't have a suitable clear, flat surface at home, you might park in the street or a neighbor's driveway. Driving on tires that are flat can damage your tire or deform the rims of your wheels, causing expensive damage. Drive as little as possible on flat tires.; , The valve cap for each tire will be on the sidewall of the tire, positioned closely to the metal of the wheel's rim. Generally, these caps are screw-on. Unscrew the valve caps for all tires.Valve caps are small and easy to lose. To prevent yours from getting lost, keep them in a sealable container, like a plastic baggie or a lidded plastic container.  This value will be in PSI (pounds per square inches). The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle is generally written on a sticker inside of the driver's door. Open this door and inspect it for a tag indicating the ideal air pressure.If you can't find the tire pressure information on your door, or if the information is unreadable, tire pressure information can be found in your car's manual. In the rare case that you lack both the tire pressure door sticker and your car's manual, you can look up the optimal air pressure for your car and tire online. For some vehicles, the recommended tire pressure for front and back tires may be different., Wait for three hours after driving for the most accurate reading.Inspect the tire pressure gauge and tire valve to make sure these are free of dirt or grit. This can sometimes get caught in a valve, making it leak, difficult to pump, or difficult to take a pressure reading. Take your gauge and:   Position it on top of the stem the tire valve. Press the gauge into the valve firmly until the sound of escaping air ceases, then release. Look at the reading on your gauge. Many common gauges have a slide reader that pops out of the base of your gauge after taking the reading. Compare this reading to the recommended PSI to determine whether your tire needs air. Repeat this for all tires on your vehicle., Take your bike pump and position its valve end over the valve of the tire you are pumping. The lever on the back of the valve should be touching the hose in the unlocked position. Press the pump valve firmly onto the tire valve, then raise the lever to lock the pump onto the tire valve.   When attaching your pump to the tire, you'll likely hear air escaping. This is completely natural when locking your bike pump valve in place. A Shrader valve generally has a stem, at the end of which is threading for a screw on cap. Inside the end of the stem, you should see a small metal pin. Presta valves, the second most common valve used for bike pumps, will have a thin, threaded cylinder of metal extending from the stem. Many bike pumps come equipped with a Shrader valve, which is also called an American valve.This part is necessary for pumping up your car tires.  Raise and lower the pump bar of your bike pump steadily. At regular intervals, check your tire pressure. Overfilling your tires can cause strain on the tire and compromise its integrity.Always follow the manufacturer recommendations for best results, but generally, avoid filling your tires with five PSI more or less than the recommended amount. A bike pump will move less air at a slower rate than a compressor, which means that this can take quite some time before your tire is filled., In the event you overfilled your tire with air, use your tire pressure gauge or some other tool to press the pin in the center of the tire valve to the side of the valve. This will release air in the tire and decrease pressure.   Check your tire pressure regularly while adjusting. If you release too much pressure, you'll have to pump again.Be precise when filling your tires with air. Filling tires with unequal amounts of air will cause them to wear out more quickly, negatively impact fuel economy, and more., In the fashion described, move from tire to tire, checking tire pressure, inflating, and adjusting each until all tires are the same pressure. When all tires are complete, take your valve caps from their container and reattach them., In a pinch, these kinds of gauges can give you a rough idea of the air pressure of your tires. However, these are often inaccurate and wear out easily, so a separate tire pressure gauge is best.   Tire pressure gauges are relatively inexpensive and small. Put one in the glove box of your car so you always have one on hand., Sometimes, the pump valve and the tire valve will seat poorly, creating gaps where air can escape. This can decrease the amount of air you pump into the tire with each pump.   In especially bad cases, a poor seal between valves can cause the tire to deflate faster than you are inflating it. Most poorly seated valves can be corrected by removing the pump valve and reattaching it again.  Bike pumps have a fairly long shelf life, but the hose of older pumps can break down over time. Cracks in it can result in more air being pumped outside the tire than what makes it inside.   Frequently, corroded or cracked hosing can be identified by sight or with a touch check. If you feel cracks, holes, or disintegrating hose, your hose may have a leak.	Park on a clear, flat surface. Remove valve caps. Determine the optimal pressure for your tires. Check tire pressure with a tire pressure gauge. Attach your pump to the tire valve. Pump up your tire. Adjust tire pressure as necessary. Inflate the remaining tires. Avoid using gauges attached to air compressors. Verify the pump is securely fastened. Inspect the hose of your pump for leaks.
On the rear of your Roomba there is a tray that fills with dirt and dust as it vacuums (also called the "bin"). Press the button on top of this tray and remove it. Dump the contents of this tray into the trashcan., You should be able to see a red semi-circle inside the tray (which may be covered with gray dirt and dust). This is your filter. This filter will easily slide out of the tray, while remaining attached on one end. Slide this out, and knock any loose dirt/dust off into the trashcan., Attach the crevice tool (the long, thin attachment) to the hose of a regular vacuum cleaner. Then turn the vacuum on and use this attachment to remove dirt and grime from the Roomba collection tray and filter., Remove the crevice tool from your vacuum hose, and instead attach the brush tool. Turn your vacuum back on and go over the filter and tray once again. This time, pay extra attention to the surface of the filter, the rubber seals, and the vents on the back of the tray. When you are finished, snap the filter back into place., Turn the Roomba upside down, and locate the side-sweeper: a circular, three-pronged plastic piece at the top left of your Roomba. Using your Phillips screwdriver, remove the single screw that holds the side-sweeper in place, and remove the side-sweeper. Using your hands or your crevice tool, clean off any hair/debris that is attached to the side-sweeper and the place where the side-sweeper attaches., The front wheel--positioned front and center on the bottom of your Roomba--should easily pop out. Use your hands to remove any hair or string attached to the wheel itself. Then use your vacuum with the crevice tool to vacuum the opening where the wheel goes., On the bottom of your Roomba, you will notice a rectangular flap, that should lift open. Under this flap, you'll find your cylindrical brush, which is likely to be very dirty. Lift out this brush., On either end of your brush there will be small bearings. (On many models, these bearings are yellow). Remove these bearings and set them aside. Then, using your hand, pull off any hair that has gotten tangled around the ends of your brush., Take out the iRobot Roomba bristle brush and slide it onto the end of your cylindrical brush. Pull the bristle brush down the length of your cylindrical brush in order to remove hair and debris. Remove the hair/debris from the bristle brush with your fingers, and repeat this process 2-3 more times.An iRobot Roomba bristle brush should have been included with your Roomba. If you have misplaced this item, you can purchase one online for around $5.  Below the the space that held the cylindrical brush, you will see a cylindrical rubber roller. This will slide out. Remove the (yellow) bearings, and pull off any dirt/hair from the ends., Using the brush attachment on your vacuum, go over all sides of the brush and roller to remove dust, dirt, and hair. Set the brush and roller aside, and switch to your crevice tool. Now vacuum the compartment where the brush and roller go, paying careful attention to the gray flap that seals the compartment., You do not need to remove the rear two wheels in order to clean them. Instead, push the left wheel down and use the crevice tool to vacuum around it. Repeat this on the other side., Using your Phillips screwdriver, remove the four small screws that hold the black bottom cover in place. These screws may be a bit difficult to remove. Then slide off the bottom cover and set it aside., Locate the four tiny screws that hold the rectangular motor unit in place, and carefully remove them. Pull the rectangular unit out of the Roomba (on many models this is blue). With the motor compartment removed, run your vacuum crevice tool over the inside of your Roomba.These screws are very small and delicate. Be careful not to strip the tops of them as you remove them, and set them in a safe place.  Using a can of compressed air, carefully work to remove any dust or debris from the motor unit. Pay attention to any crevices and openings.If you do not have compressed air, you can go over the motor with your vacuum crevice tool. However, be very careful not to disturb any wires.  Place the motor compartment back inside the Roomba and secure it with the four tiny screws. Then replace the bottom cover and secure it with its four screws. Pop the front wheel back in place. Next, return the bearings to the rubber roller and brush, and return them to the proper compartment (in that order),and close the flap. Then, replace the side-sweeper and secure it with a single screw. Finally, reinsert the collection tray.	Empty your Roomba. Remove the filter. Vacuum the tray and filter using a regular vacuum and the crevice tool. Switch to the brush tool. Remove the side-sweeper. Remove the front wheel. Remove the brush. Remove the bearings. Use the iRobot Roomba bristle brush. Remove the rubber roller. Vacuum the brush, roller, and compartment. Clean the rear wheels. Remove the bottom cover. Remove the motor unit. Clean the motor with compressed air. Reassemble your Roomba.
This is a good idea because the showers at such festivals are slightly unhygienic and probably cold.; , This will keep it well refrigerated and you don't have to sample any of the fast food stuff! But if greasy spoons (which are quite nice as an occasional treat) are your thing, then take plenty of money because food and drinks there tend to be twice as much as the average KFC where you live.  If kids are coming with you, have them at your side at all times. Children get lost very, very easily at these things and your child/children getting lost can be a very traumatic experience. But if you do get lost, make sure you report it to one of the festival tents; these should be located in several places around the grounds. Also, a good tip is to write your mobile/cell phone number on your child's arm so if someone can ring you if they find your child.  It is a lot safer there than it is around the tent.  12% of A&E emergencies are due to dangerous actions at gigs.  Sunday night is bonfire night, and they might trash or burn your tent! Alternatively, take it down (if it's worth taking down) and leave at a cloakroom or in a car.  Walking back from a gig in the middle of the night can be a real nightmare otherwise!  , Wet clothes can be horrific to wear the next day!  , They will completely wreck your festival experience and you could get very very much in trouble - by the police and getting hurt by using the drugs themselves. ,, Either they're not there or the line is ten thousand miles long.	Take wet wipes for your face. Don't buy lunch, bring it packed in a cool pack. Stay Safe. Make sure all your money is in your wallet, not in your tent. If you're crowdsurfing be very careful. If you are staying until Monday morning (this is possible at Roskilde), don't go too far away from your tent, or at least take all your belongings out of it. Put a brightly coloured ribbon around your tent to know where yours is. Take plenty of dry clothes!, Most importantly do not be tempted to try any drugs regardless of what other people say. Don't get too wasted, you will forget your experience and wake up with a banging hangover :(.  , Keep a mobile (cellphone) with you at all times.  , Never expect an on-site cashpoint. Last but not least, have fun!
Each sewing machine brand is different, so it’s a good idea to check the manual that came with your sewing machine for directions on how to clean and oil the machine.Some manufacturers recommend cleaning the machine after every 10 hours you use it. Clean it when you see lint starting to gather. Some older machines mark the spots where you should drop oil in red. Others tell you where to drop it using pictures to guide you. If you don’t have a copy of the instructional manual, you should be able to get one on the manufacturer’s website. You might even be able to download it. If that doesn’t work, call the manufacturer and ask for one. You will be asked the machine name, model, and serial number most likely. You could also ask a local dealer.Some machines do not need to be oiled. They are self-lubricating. Such a machine will still need to be maintained, but if it says not to oil it at home, don’t.; , You want to make sure that you don’t use too much oil. It’s a good idea to use a little bit of oil, and see how it works. Then use more. Place a piece of newspaper under the machine while you work.   Oil small areas at a time. You should take apart small areas of the machine piece-by-piece to oil them. Study the instructional manual drawings first so that you understand the function and name of each part. Disassemble the parts following the instructions in your manual. You will want to follow a process of cleaning the piece, brushing it out, and then lubricating each area. After you finish with each area of the sewing machine, you will want to put it back together, and then move on to the next part. Replace needles frequently. You will probably want to do this with each new project.  You should clean the machine before you oil it. First, turn off the machine and unplug it.   Remove all of the extra pieces of the machine that will get in the way of a thorough cleaning. For example, remove thread, bobbin cases, plates, and the presser foot. Remove the stitch plate. If your machine has a bobbin hook, you should remove it because lint could be collected there. Remove the machine’s needle for safety purposes.  You should be able to brush away the lint with the stiff lint brush. Brush away the lint that you can. Sometimes these small lint brushes and other cleaning materials will come with the sewing machine.   To reach pieces of lint that are hard to sweep away because they are compacted, try using tweezers to remove them. It's essential that you thoroughly clean your machine before you apply the oil. Try using a soft cloth to wipe away any lint or residue on the bobbin hook. Some people also use clean mascara brushes or pipe cleaners for this process.  You could clean parts of the machine with a can of compressed air. There are some cautions necessary with using compressed air, though.   The problem with canned air is that it could blow lint deeper in the machine. To reduce this problem, hold the nozzle at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) away from the machine part, and spray air at an angle into the machine so it blows the lint out of the machine instead of into it. Use the air to clean the bobbin case area and the bobbin case itself. This is the area where the bobbin loads up. Stray dust should fall out.Use the air to clean the bobbin case also. Clean under the needle plate also. You will have to unscrew the needle plate. Remove the plate. You will see dust inside of it. Spray the area with the compressed air. Clean any other parts as instructed by your sewing machine manual.  You cannot use car oil. You need to buy oil that is specifically for sewing machines. Sewing machine oil is clear and comes in a small bottle.   Your sewing machine may have come with a bottle of oil when you purchased it from the dealer or store. You can find this oil in sewing and fabric shops. This cannot be said enough. You cannot use any other oil than the oil recommended in your owner’s manual. Household oil or WD-40 will not work. Sewing machine oil is of different consistency than oil you’d put in a car. It’s clear and lighter. , You should only need a small amount of oil. Your owner’s manual will tell you where to drop it in the machine. It only takes a couple of drops.   Generally, you will be told to squeeze a few drops of oil on the housing unit that the bobbin case sits in.Most machines want you to oil the shuttle hook (which is the thing that spins inside the bobbin casing). Often you will be told to drop oil inside the hook race and the housing of the sewing machine. That’s the silver ring that the bobbin hook fits into. Your machine will perform better and be quieter if you drop oil here because the two pieces rub together. You may also be instructed to put a drop of oil on the outer ring of the bobbin hook. This is where it slides along the hook race., You could leave a piece of fabric under the presser foot to soak up any excess oil. You don’t want oil to stain your next project when you start stitching.   Take a cloth, and wipe away excess oil. Otherwise, it could end up on your fabric and thread. Put your parts back together. Avoid oiling plastic parts.If you use too much oil, you can run muslin through the machine, and then wipe the exterior of the machine. Use a damp, soapy towel. Let it sit. That way the oil will collect. Then, do it again. You might need to do this a few times over the subsequent days until all of the extra oil is not in the machine. Test the machine. Before you start sewing a new project, make a few stitches on a piece of fabric you don’t care about. You want to see if any excess oil remains. Screw the needle plate back into the sewing machine.  Remove the needle plate. Turn the handwheel towards yourself until the needle is fully raised and open the hinged front cover. Unscrew the needle plate screws. A screw driver will come with the machine.   Clean the feed dog. Remove the bobbin. Use the brush supplied to clean the area. Remove the bobbin case. Snap the two hook retaining arms outwards. Remove the hook cover and the hook. Clean with a soft cloth. Lubricate the points in the instructional manual with 1-2 drops of sewing machine oil. Turn the handwheel until the hook race is in the left position. Replace the hook. Replace the hook cover, and snap back the hook retaining arms. Insert the bobbin case and bobbin and replace the stitch plate.	Follow the instructional manual. Go slowly. Prepare the machine for cleaning. Take a small, stiff lint brush. Use compressed air. Buy sewing machine oil. Put drops of oil into sewing machine parts. Wipe away excess oil. Oil a Singer sewing machine.
Attach the brush accessory to the hose of a vacuum cleaner. Use a medium setting and vacuum up dirt. Alternatively, you could use a brush with soft bristles. Gently sweep up the dirt into a dustpan.   Regardless of which method you use, avoid rubbing the leather too harshly. This could set in the stain.; , Water-soluble substances include coffee, tea, milk, soda, or sugary preserves. Use a clean, dry cloth to blot the spill and absorb the liquid. Work quickly, but be gentle. Then, dampen another cloth with plain water. Start rubbing at the outside of the stain and gradually work your way inward. Use another dry cloth to blot excess water until it's completely absorbed.   Never dry your furniture with a hair dryer. Dry hot air will damage the leather., Use a paper towel to wipe away the substance. Avoid rubbing too hard to prevent the mess from getting ground in to the upholstery. Then, soak one of the cloths in diluted soap with a neutral pH (6.5-7.5). Begin gently rubbing the stain at the outer edge and work your way inward. Finally, dry the wet area with the other cloth. Continue blotting until all the moisture is absorbed. Don't use a hair dryer.Oil-based substances include oils, mayonnaise, chocolate, and ketchup.	Vacuum or brush away solid debris. Remove water-soluble stains with clean cloths and water. Clean oil-based stains with neutral soap.
A bar is simply one line of your song. Most raps are built out of 16 or 32 bar verses though they can be as short as 8 or 12 bars as well. If you're writing the whole song yourself you might have 2-3 verses and a hook. You might also have a short 8-10 bar bridge, which is a short verse with a slightly different beat or structure.You can write your rap without knowing the bars as well. Simply write until you feel like your verse is finished, then edit the beat to fit the desired length.  Raps are written around rhymes. Rhyme connects to lines so that they flow smoothly together, pulling the listener through the song. While all lines of your rap don't need to rhyme, and probably should not, you need to have a firm grasp of rhyme techniques to become a rapper. Luckily, this doesn't require any studying, just an ear for what sounds good to you. Still, it can help to know the different types of rhyme common in rap:    Simple Rhyme: When the last syllables of two lines rhyme, like "Can" and "man." This is the most common and basic form of rhyme.  Multi-syllabic rhyme: One of the best ways to show your lyrical skills is to rhyme multiple syllables at once. This can stretch across multiple words as well, such as Big Daddy Kane in "One Day:" "Ain’t no need for wondering who’s the man/ Staying looking right always an exclusive brand."  Slant Rhyme: Rhyming too closely related, but technically non-rhyming, words. Usually, they have a common vowel sound. This is incredibly common in rap, because how you say/sing the words can make them sound much more similar. Examples include "Nose" and "go," or "orange" and "porridge."Internal Rhyme (In-Rhyme): Rhyming words that do not come at the end of a line but in the middle of it. For example, Madvillains' "Rhinestone Cowboy:" "Made of fine chrome alloy / find him on the grind he's a rhinestone cowboy.", Punchlines are the big lines, jokes, or rhymes that elevate the song from good to great. There are thousands of great examples, but they are mostly a matter of personal preference. To write them, try to think of the punchline first then build the rhyming lines around it.   If your punchline is "I'm stepping over competition, so expect to be trampled," you might try to write a line leading into it that ends with a word rhyming with "trampled." For example, "They see me in the booth so they know they should scramble/ I'm steppin' over competition so expect to be trampled").  A rhyme scheme is simply how the song is structured. The most common way to do this is with alternating couplets, which are two lines that rhyme at the end. The next two lines also rhyme at the end, but with a different set of words. That said, there are many, many ways to write out rhyme schemes, such as alternating (the first line rhymes with the third, and the second with the fourth), or rhyming 4-6 lines with the same word (like the beginning of "Get 'Em High"). The best way to learn is practice.   If you're a rapper that raps with a lot of flow (smooth, quick words) you may want to have every bar end with the same amount of syllables or almost the same amount of syllables. If you're a rapper that raps fast you may want to have lots of internal rhymes in every bar, like " the industry's gettin' clean and I've seen what them haters mean/ if you thought I was lettin' up setting up the terrain was dreamed". If you're a story rapper you can have the first verse be your intro, your second verse your problem, and your last verse your conclusion. To match this, you might play with a different rhyme scheme in every verse to show growth or use a similar one to indicate that there is no growth.  Make sure you mean every word and every word comes from your soul. Let the music come to you. To start writing good lyrics, you should throw on a beat that juices your brain start thinking of some insane rhymes. It's all about the state of mind.   Specifics from real life will always make a better song. The reason Nas' Illmatic is one of the all-time great albums is because it feels lived in, not made up. If you don't have a theme or rhyme scheme yet, just start writing lines that you like. Eventually, these lines will come together to tell a full song, and this can be a great way to practice rhymes. The best rappers are able to tell stories from real life, connecting to their audience's memories and emotions. They are successful not because they tell crazy or unbelievable stories, but because they make a simple story connect with practice and well-written rhymes.	Figure out how many bars you have to rap on. Understand rhyme inside and out. Write "punchline raps" in reverse. Organize your lines into a rhyme scheme. Make sure your song is personal and real.
You will still need remaining string to add the button at the end.  You may want to thread the string through a needle in order to secure the button in place.          Tie a strong knot in the end of the button to ensure it stays in place. Consider threading the string through the button and then tying it in place underneath the button.	Braid the remaining portion of the bracelet and tie a knot toward the end. Thread the button onto the end of the bracelet and tie in place. Finished.
If you are going to be wearing this wreath over a hairstyle (such as for a wedding), get your hair into that style first and then measure your hair. Some hairstyles, such as French braids and braided crowns, can add bulk to your head., Try to use some thicker floral, like the kind that has paper around it. This will help the florist's tape stick better to it. Do not use scissors to cut the wire or you will dull them. Use wire cutters instead.  The ring should hold its shape. If it is too floppy, twist two to three strands of wire together, and make the ring again. This should make it sturdier.  You can also wrap some more tape around the entire wire ring. This will give you a base to work on. It will also make the color more consistent.  Try to cut all the stems down to the same length. This will make the crown neater in the end.   Try using large, medium, and small flowers. This will give your crown some variety.  Don't tape the flowers to the base just yet. You want to get your design down first. It is easier to make changes while the flowers are still on the table. Try alternating between different shapes, sizes, and colors. Here are some more design ideas:   Place the largest flowers in the top/front of the crown. Use smaller and smaller flowers as you go towards the back of the crown. Try having all the flowers pointing in the same direction, towards or away the top of the crown. The flowers don't have to be right up against each other. You can have them spaced as close together or as far apart as you want. Instead of attaching flowers all the way around the wire base, place them only on the top.  Hold the flower against so that the stem is laying horizontally alongside the wire. Wrap some florist's tape around the stem and the wire. Start just below the bloom, and keep wrapping until you are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem. Cut the tape and press the edge down to seal it.  Place it so that the bloom overlaps the first flower's. The closer together the two blooms are, the fuller and heavier your crown will look in the end. The further away the blooms are, the thinner and more delicate your crown will look.  Keep working your way around the circle, until you've used up all of the flowers you laid out in the beginning.  Fold several long pieces of ribbon in half and place them just behind the spot where the wires overlap. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the loop just above the wire. Wrap the ribbon ends over the wire and down through the loop. Gently tug on the ribbons to secure them.  If you see any gaps or places where you want it to look more full, gently part the flowers, insert another one and tape it in place.	Measure your head and add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). Cut a piece of sturdy wire according to that measurement. Make a ring with the wire and overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Wrap florist's tape around the overlapping ends to secure them. Choose your flowers and cut the stems down to 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) below the bloom.Use scissors to cut real or dried flowers, and wire cutters to cut fake flowers. Arrange the flowers in a pattern you like. Attach the first flower to the wire base. Lay the second flower just behind first one and secure it with florist's tape. Continue placing and taping the flowers. Consider adding some ribbon. Try on your crown and make any adjustments, if necessary.
To make this costume, you will need:   Sewing supplies Black felt Yellow felt White felt Black hooded sweatshirt Hot glue Dark pants and shoes  , Use sharp scissors to cut both pieces out.   You can freehand sketch the beak pattern, if desired. Note that you need to draw the beak from a side view, rather than a top view. The base should be somewhat rectangular, but the beak itself should appear as a hooked or curved triangular shape. Your beak should be large enough to attach to your sweatshirt and make the hood of the black sweatshirt look like the bird’s head. The size may be dependent on if you are an adult or a kid.  Lay the two beak pieces on top of each other and sew along the top edge. Place the beak on the top of the hood, just above the opening, and sew the base of the beak onto the hood.   Since felt doesn't fray, you do not need to turn the material inside-out as you work. Make sure that your seams are neat and even, however, to prevent the work from looking messy. The beak should be positioned in the center of the hood and should hang over the face area when you put the hood on your head.  For each eye, you will need a yellow circle, a black circle, and a white semi-circle.   The yellow circles should be about 3 inches in diameter. The black circles should be about 2.5 inches in diameter. The white semi-circle should be about 1 inch in diameter.  Lay the black circle on top of the yellow circle, precisely centered. Glue in place. Lay the white semi-circle on top of the black circle so that the flat edge lies in the center of the black circle. Glue in place.   Use fabric glue or hot glue for this. Let dry before pressing on.  Cut off a few individual feathers from your strip of feathered fringe. Turn each eye over to reveal the back, and glue these feathers around about half of each eye.   Note that the feathers should fan out from the side of the eye facing the flat side of your white semi-circular portion.  Position the eyes on either side of the beak on the hood. They should be to the sides of the beak, but above the actual beak base. Fix in place by sewing or gluing them on.   The curved side of the white semi-circles should face inward, toward the beak, and the feathers surrounding each eye should fan out to the sides.  Cut a strip of feathered fringe, out of black felt, long enough to cover the sleeve of your arm, extending from the shoulder seam down to the cuff. Pin and sew in place.   Note that the fringe should point down and out when you put the shirt on. Keep that in mind as you pin and sew. Repeat this process with the other sleeve so that both are covered with black feathered fringe.  Put on some black pants and black shoes. Slip on your feathered black sweatshirt, then pull the hood over your head so that the beak and eyes show. This completes your raven costume.	Gather your materials. Cut out a basic beak pattern.Sketch out two hooked beak halves onto black felt. Sew the beak. Cut out the eye pieces. Piece the eyes together. Glue a few feathers to the back of each eye. Adhere the eyes to the hood. Sew the fringe to the outside of each arm. Put it all together.
Make sure the entire ball is painted yellow. Hang or rest in an egg carton to dry. They must be completely dry before proceeding with the next steps.; ,   Cut long diamonds from the orange felt. You'll need one orange diamond one per bird. Fold in half to create a beak. Keep pinched with your fingers. Glue in place on the fold line/area on the ping pong ball. The triangle edges will stick forward to form the beak shape. Repeat for each chick you're making.  Draw on eyes with the black Sharpie marker.   You can also create eyes with eye stickers, but handmade ones are fast and easy to do, plus you have plenty of creative leeway to make the eye shapes any way you like (try anime style, for example), and with or without eyelashes too. Repeat for each chick you're making.    For each bird being made, cut out two wings from the yellow felt. Cut the wings in a rounded way, not spiky or too textured. Keep the chick looking soft and cute! Glue the wings in place on the sides of the chick. Repeat for each chick you're making.    At the end of each leg, shape the three "toes." You'll need to play around with the balance a little, to be sure that the toes enable the chick to stand.   When finished, glue the legs firmly in place. Allow to dry completely. Paint the legs completely using orange paint. Repeat for each chick you're making.  Place on a tabletop or in a basket. If used as a toy, do not give to children under 3, as the small parts are a safety hazard.	Paint the ping pong balls yellow. Make the beaks. Create eyes. Make the wings for the chick. Shape legs from the wire. Display the finished chicks.
(YouTube guitar lessons are a great way to self teach); , No matter how hard you try, if you don't enjoy learning, it will make it far harder. Play the music you like, most bands have at least a couple beginner songs, so try to play songs that you enjoy playing.  It makes it a lot easier to learn if you play guitar with a buddy, you can compare tips and both play different roles in different songs (providing you have the same taste in music)e.g they could play lead and you could play rhythm, plus it is really fun to play the same song with someone. , 45 minutes to an hour each night is good, but stop if you feel bored or tired. Start fresh the next night(or day). Its also a good Idea to keep your guitar set up so you can just pick it up and play if you have a spare couple of minutes.  Make sure you have a good supply of picks/plectrums (if you are using a pick instead of finger picking)and make sure you always have a spare set of strings in case one snaps (nothing more annoying than not having a string)  , Having a guitar tuner is much better than trying to tune by ear, they are much easier to use and take much less time, it is very annoying if tuning by ear does not work, I was close to smashing a guitar over it.	Learn the basics first: no matter what type of music you want to play or what type of guitar you want to use, you will need to learn some basic chords, they are extremely easy to find on the net and there are many books covering this sort of thing,also, YouTube has tons of videos for this. Make sure you enjoy learning. Find a buddy to play with. Don't get ahead of yourself: The chances are, if a song sounds hard to play, it probably is (not all the time though) so take it slowly, don't try to learn an entire song at once, try to learn a group of five or six chords on a song at a time, if you try to go too fast you'll only get confused and frustrated, then you'll get nowhere.  , Practise regularly: It's a lot easier to practise if you set a certain time to practise. Stock up on supplies. Buy a tuner.
Automobiles average about 12,000 miles a year. For example, if a car is 5 years old but has far fewer than 60,000 miles, the odometer may have been tampered with. Look closely at the numbers on the odometer. Some auto makers program odometers to show an asterisk if the mileage is changed. General Motors mechanical odometers have a black space between the numbers. If you see a white or silver space, the GM odometer probably has been changed.; , If the title is from out of state or brand new, it may be a case of title washing or title fraud, and the mileage given may be false.   Be sure to examine the title's mileage number closely and look for smudging or other tampering. The title should show the mileage in crisp type on a clean background.  Examine the mileage on the receipts and inspection stickers and compare to the odometer. Inspection stickers can be found on door frames or windows.  If the dashboard isn't put together perfectly, the odometer may have been tampered with.  If either is badly worn but the odometer has low mileage, it may be a case of odometer fraud.  A mechanic knows what parts would be original on an older car. For example, a car's odometer may say 30,000 miles. Beware if the car has new parts that ordinarily would not be replaced until 60,000 miles. This may indicate odometer tampering.  If the odometer says 25,000 miles, the car should still have its original tires, with tread deeper than than 2/32 of an inch (1.5875 mm). Ask the mechanic to check tire tread with a depth gauge.   You can check tire tread depth yourself using a penny. Insert the penny into the tread upside down. If Abraham Lincoln's head is partly covered, the tire has more than 2/32 of an inch.	Examine the odometer for the number of miles. Ask the seller to show you the original title, not a duplicate. Ask to see oil change and maintenance receipts and inspection stickers. Look for missing screws on or near the dashboard. Inspect the brake pedal and floor mats. Take the vehicle to a mechanic and ask him to examine the car for wear and tear. Measure the depth of the tread on the car's tires.
After your practice session, you will likely have some rosin, sweat, and grime on your hands which you don’t want to accidentally transfer onto different parts of your violin.; , Cleaning cloths help prevent buildup of rosin and other substances and also keep your violin looking nice by removing fingerprints and other markings. You always want to have at least two soft, clean, lint-free cloths to wipe down the various parts of your violin.   Be sure to keep these cleaning cloths in your violin case so that they’re on hand at all times. You can buy cleaning cloths that are specially made for violin cleaning, such as SHAR or Glaesel, but you can also use what you have, such as flannel. Just be sure you are using a cloth that is soft and non-abrasive.  It is important to wipe down the strings of your violin after each playing session because rosin can quickly accumulate and change the sound of your instrument. This is an easy step that should become a regular habit after practicing.   Using one cloth, wipe the rosin off each individual string, moving up and down each string in a sliding motion. Be sure to wipe off any rosin flakes that might break off during this step. If there is a build-up of rosin on your strings that you cannot wipe off, you can use pure alcohol to remove this. Put a few drops of alcohol on the cloth and rub on the strings, but be careful to ensure that the alcohol does not touch any other part of the violin as alcohol will damage the varnish., Just like on the strings, rosin can build up relatively quickly on the bow. You can use the same cloth you used for the strings as you are wiping away the same substance.   Just as with the strings, simply take the cleaning cloth to wipe down the bow in the direction that the hairs are running in. Do not go against the grain, just wipe up and down using a light touch.  The face of the violin refers to its body, excluding the strings or neck of the violin. You will want to use a different cloth for this step, as you want to avoid rubbing rosin or any other substance onto the violin.   When wiping the F-holes, take care to ensure the cloth does not get caught in them. The woodwork of F-holes is delicate and can change or ruin the sound of the violin if damaged., The bridge of the violin is liable to have collected some rosin during your practice session. Use a cloth to dust the rosin out from under the bridge but maintain a light touch, as the bridge is very fragile.   Try using a Q-tip for those spots that are especially hard to reach.  Having a polished violin keeps the varnish in good shape and also takes care of the gunky build up that inevitably occurs after years of playing any instrument.   If your violin is new or in good shape, you may not need to polish it at all. However, if your instrument is dull and hasn’t been polished in a long time (a year or more), you may want to polish it. Check with your luthier (a specialist in string instruments) if you aren’t sure.  Only use a commercial violin polish rather than furniture polish or water as these can damage both the varnish and sound of the violin.Never use violin cleaners or polishes on master instruments or antiques, because the oils they contain could open a crack and make your instrument difficult to restore.Polishes generally contain some type of oil, which can create fissures in the violin’s wood and damage the instrument in the long run. Therefore, there is some disagreement over whether polishes should be used on violins at all., If you do decide to use polish on your violin, be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with your polish and be careful to only polish the body of the violin.   Apply polish to the cloth, not directly on the instrument. Rub out the smudges, dirt, any rosin buildup, using the cloth. Buff on all sides, but be careful around the F-holes to prevent polish buildup. Then take a separate rag to wipe off any excess polish to prevent moisture from entering in and damaging the violin. Avoid the strings and bridge of the violin as you don’t want any polish building up on these parts and affecting the sound of the instrument.  The oils and sweat on your skin can attack the varnish of your violin and leave marks. The less skin contact you make with your violin, the longer it will last in terms of great sound and appearance.   Practice lifting and holding your violin as little as possible until it becomes second nature to not grab and touch your violin all over its body.  Though people often forget about this step, your violin will not stay clean if its storage case is not clean. Empty and vacuum out your case once a week or once you start seeing flakes of dust, dirt, and rosin.   This step has the added benefit of preventing dust mites that may eat your violin’s bow hair., If you start to notice cracks or other changes in your violin, it’s time to take your instrument into a reputable violin maker or music store.	Wash your hands. Get several cleaning cloths. Wipe down the strings. Wipe the bow. Wipe down the face of the violin. Clean the bridge. Know when to polish your violin. Get the right type of polish. Use a cloth to polish. Limit the places you touch with your hands. Clean your case. Know when it’s time for a professional tune-up.
Hybrid seeds: These are seeds whose parent plants are 2 distinctly different plants that have been crossbred to promote certain desirable traits. These seeds may produce plants that are more disease resistant, produce larger fruit, or have an easier harvest. The disadvantage of this type of garden seed is that many unique genes are lost and attributes such as a unique taste, smell, or texture may not be present in the plants and fruits from hybrid seeds. The seeds collected from hybrid plants may not be suitable to plant for the next year as they may not produce the same type of plants as those they came from. Heirloom seeds: Heirloom seeds come from plants that have not been genetically changed by humans. Heirloom plants and vegetables have distinct smells, tastes, and textures that hybrid seeds may not have. The seeds from these plants will produce the same type of plant they were harvested from. Although heirloom seeds may not have some characteristics bred into them that the hybrid seeds possess, many of these characteristics are not particularly sought after by the backyard gardener. Organic seeds: These seeds come from parent plants that are pesticide-free and organically grown. These seeds may be heirloom or hybrid.; , Mark off the seeds as you find sources for them so you do not double order.  Many seed companies have been in business for many years and take pride in producing quality seeds that have good sprout rates and will produce healthy plants. Look into how long a seed company has been in business and if there are any consumer complaints against them.  Seed packets come with an expiration date printed on them. Make sure you have the current year's seeds. Although expired seeds may sprout, the sprout rate may be less or the plants may not be as healthy as they could be.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a map of 11 climate zones in North America that lets gardeners know if the plants of the seeds they are buying for their garden will survive in their part of the country. This can give you a general guidelines to follow when selecting seeds for a garden.  Some seeds need cool weather for germination, such are cabbages, lettuce, and Brussels sprouts. Others prefer warm to hot weather, such as zucchini, corn, and watermelon. Look on the back of your seed packet for the months to achieve the best germination rate for your gardening zone.	Learn the types of seed that are available to plant in your garden. Decide on the types of seeds you want to plant in your garden, and write down a list of them. Buy from a reputable seed company. Check the expiration date on the seed packet at the store or when the seeds arrive in the mail. Choose garden seeds that can be grown in the zone in which you live. Buy garden seeds for the growing season you want to planting in.
You'll need to have long hair. Your hair should come down to about the tip of your nose. You need to wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. After that, on a cool setting, you need to dry your hair with a hair dryer and brush it with a round brush as you do that. After that's done, and your hair's still a tiny bit wet, use straighteners to straighten your hair. After this, apply product to your hair. Only use a little bit. After that, use industrial strength hairspray. You should use the hairspray upside down so it gets in your roots. Then, put everything in place and spray, then you're done with that.    Get the right jacket. You'll need a brown tweed blazer with two-button closure.It's a good idea to check thrift stores for a match. Add the shirt. The shirt is an expensive one. You could try a regular slim fit dress shirt in either burgundy or cerulean depending on which bow tie you're planning to wear (in series 5, the shirt matched the bow tie and braces). Use black slim fitting dress pants or black jeans. Try to get matching x-back braces and a bow tie. These either come in burgundy or blue. In series 5, the bow tie was a pre tied variety. Try your best to match the boots. The boots are All-saints layer boots. If you can find a cheaper alternative, go for it. Black Doc Martens work nicely - however, they look like they are beaten up and dirtied, so I'd recommend going for that look. Get a brass wrist-watch, with the face on the inside of your wrist. It completes the series five costume.  You'll need to start with his iconic brown tartan jacket, with elbow patches. Alternatively, you could get the green coat he wore in "Let's Kill Hitler", "The Girl Who Waited", "Closing Time", and "The Wedding of River Song". It works for those extra cold days.   The shirts are all in shades of sky blue with white buttons, or white, with a check pattern on the white shirts, and still all fit relatively tight and slim. There are more bow ties, in either burgundy, blue with a horizontal bark pattern, or an Aztec key pattern bow tie. The bow ties are usually self-tie, so learn how to tie a bow tie. There are links to the series 6 bow ties in the tips section. You can take liberties with the boots as long as they're black, however make sure they are clean. Not necessarily shiny, but the whole series 6 outfit was a lot more put together than the series 5 costume.  In series 7, the Doctor's wardrobe changed dramatically as he abandoned his tweed, his braces, and his old TARDIS interior.   His new coat is a purple frock coat. His waistcoat is usually either in light purple, black, or in tweed gray. The boots. Smith's new boots are tan boots that come up to his ankles and lace up, and were light brown in colour. He also wears what appears to be a fob watch (Ah! Remember "Human Nature" and "The Family of Blood" two-parter? Thank you David Tennant-era!) If you want the costume from "The Snowmen" and "The Time of the Doctor," go with a long purple trench coat. They might be hard to find elsewhere, but if you search for actual replica costumes, you can get your hands on one!  , They have a lot of things you could use for the 11th Doctor, If you want, get some weird headwear. Go for a fez or a stetson (preferably a fez). Stetsons are cool.  "Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap if you're smart. If you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put in a trap...Me." - Eleventh Doctor (The Time of Angels, 2010)	Start with the hair for Matt Smith. Put together his series 5 look, if desired. Copy his series 6 look, if you prefer. Mix it up with a series 7 look, if you want. If you want to find a cheap suit for the 11th Doctor, go to Value Village. Add a hat. You're done.

Are you all friends with common interests? Or are you searching for people with a similar vision to perform with? Regardless, make sure that you as performers have equal say in of the creation and progress of your troupe. Troupes that involve every member in the creative process are much stronger in the long run. Not every idea will be used, but approaching each member's opinion with an open, receptive mind will make all the difference.; , Groups of three to five girls are probably big enough in the beginning. As your organization and skill for production improves, you can consider taking on more performers. Remember, the smaller the group, the easier it is to coordinate rehearsal times, workshops and show dates.  Your road will be easier if you have this. Remember, it is incredibly important to have similar goals in mind when sourcing performers. Are you looking to tour, or are you rooted in one area? Is forming a troupe a potential business venture, or a simply hobby? It is important to have a uniting theme that ties performers in as members of the troupe, but variety is the spice of life. Showcasing each performer's individual talent is much more important than forcing conformity.  Are there any 'newbie' nights in your area for upcoming performers? Do you have friends/families that would let you do a private show and build up your set lists? Offering to stage kitten or help out at established shows can also be a foot in the door, though you should not presume to be asked to perform simply after selling a bit of merchandise!  , A good rule of thumb is to operate for 6 months to 1 year and see what your financial situation is like and whether you want to consider this professionally. Talk to a business mentor or a tax representative to be sure.  Even if you are only really a hobby group, think business wise. Create a brief business plan - think about how you are going to market yourself and make yourself individual. Check out your competitors and analyze, with an objective mind, what their strengths and weaknesses are and how your group will compare.  Most successful businesses and groups have an online presence. The more places you are online and the more searchable you are the better success you will have at being hired. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are all excellent. As far as creating a website, there are several free website builders with easy templates to help you get started. Make sure you create an email address specifically for your group to protect both your privacy and your inbox capacity!  , While on the subject of websites and emails, there is very little point getting online if you don't have photos or images to showcase your group. You only need a small budget and a little bit of imagination to get some great photos. Get a friend that is camera savvy and can take a good snap or offer TFP for emerging amateur photographers. Local photography forums may offer a step in the right direction. If you're inclined, you might only need to scout some good locations or invest some lighting and a backdrop to get a few good photos.  What sort of image do you want to have? This might evolve and change over the years, but in your initial stages what kind of look do you want? It comes back to your ideas about what burlesque is and what style you want to perform. Classic? Neo? You can get great costumes by perusing a local costume store, vintage or second hand stores, or online. Or if you have an act prepared, try getting some staged shots of it. Most importantly make sure the photos represent your group in a concise, creative way.  It's likely you will all have your own ideas for acts and costumes so keep that very collaborative. That aside, work out your own strengths and weaknesses. Find someone that has time to deal with everyday emails/Facebook inquiries. You may find local artists willing and able to help create promotional material as well. Keeping each member of the troupe engaged in the building of a recognizable identity is important, so make sure everyone has a voice!  , Build alliances with other performers. It's unlikely you will be able to run a show from start to finish with fewer than five members. Keep in mind, each act is typically 3-5 minutes long. Add comedians, MCs, dancers, actors, musicians to your friend list on Facebook. Keep a track of performers in your local area. Check out their shows and introduce yourself. Always keep a business card handy! You never know what may come of a chance run in.  There's no need to stress. Keeping a light, positive attitude will ensure that everyone enjoys each step of the process. You may not be a Dita Von Teese, Immodesty Blaize or Kitten De Ville overnight, but keep in mind, neither were they! If you ever begin to feel as though the stress of producing shows and organizing other performers is too great, then solo performance may be the route for you. But overall make sure you behave professionally, explore the history of this incredible art form and have fun!	Start by thinking about how you are bringing this troupe together. Keep it small. Make sure you all have similar interests and a shared vision. Start finding out about possible performance opportunities. Think about whether or not you will need to set up a business name/ABN etc. Operate with a business mentality. Get online. Photos. Come up with a theme for your group. Organisation can be tricky, especially managing schedules of different performers. Network. Have FUN!
; , Tomatoes favor a more acidic soil with a pH of 6.2 to 6.8. Use a pH soil testing kit, available at home improvement and garden stores, to test the pH levels of the soil. , Using a trowel or shovel, move the soil while it is dry. Working with wet soil will make it difficult to move and aerate, and it will stick to your tools. If soil pH conditions aren't ideal for growing tomato plants, add fertilizer to prepare your soil for planting.  Apply peat moss, compost or manure to the soil to improve its quality. Mix in small amounts of any or each of these components as you dig and mix your soil prior to planting. The richer the soil, the better the growing conditions.  Tomato plants require being set deeply in the soil, up to their first leaves. , Dissolve 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of fertilizer into 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Apply 1 cup (240 ml) of the solution to the base of each tomato plant. For larger areas, apply 2 lbs. (907 g) of fertilizer per 100 square feet.	Choose a soil for planting your tomatoes that is well drained, deep and loamy (rich with sand, silt and clay). Test the soil's acidity. Choose an area where the soil receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight.  , Work the soil to prepare it for planting. Supplement the soil. Choose an area where the soil is deep. Purchase a fertilizer with a 5-10-5 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.  , Prepare the fertilizer.
For best results, make sure the actual card is twice the height of the envelope and the pop up shape one half the height of it. A pop up that's too big will prove cumbersome and hard to manage.   Scrapbook paper makes for good greeting card material. Cardstock works well, too -- just make sure your crease is straight and firm.; , Give it a firm crease with your fingernail or a ruler's edge. Make sure it's straight!         , Make these about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The cut should be made in from the folded edge of the card in order to make a flap. You can make your cuts deeper or more widely spaced if you wish; take into account the size of your pop up. A bigger pop up needs a bigger flap.          If you don't like the fact that there's now a gaping hole in your card, cover it up! Take a piece of paper, cut it to size, fold it in half, and voila! You now have a border for the edge of your card. Problem solved.  Fold the flap over on to the front, then fold it on to the back of the card. Open the card and push the flap up toward you. Pinch the middle to crease it.  It could be a picture of a gift, a name, a heart, a part of a photograph, or anything that takes your fancy. Cut out your pop-up shape and glue it on to the front of the pop-up - i.e., the part that is vertical when the bottom, inside portion of your card is flat against the table and the card is open. Allow the glue plenty of time to dry.          For this part, it's best to use a glue stick. You don't want a soggy mess being made of you and the card.  Write your message, put it inside the envelope and give it to your intended recipient. They'll love it!   If you have ribbon, glitter, stickers, stamps, or any scrapbooking materials around the house, use them!	Cut out a rectangular piece of the colored paper. Fold it in half, short sides together. Make two cuts. Crease the pop-up. Decide what you want to pop up. Finish the card.
Lighter colors occupy less visual weight, opening up the room. Use glass and thin-legged tables so the eye can see straight through to the floor, making it virtually invisible. Avoid dark stains, woods, or colors as they have a heavy effect, constricting the room.   Design with a cool eye in mind, but adding bright, warmer colors as accents. In general, cooler colors recede, letting the room take center stage -- so that wood floor shouldn't be stained any darker than it already is. Keep the colors to three or less, however; if you're a texture-lover, go monochromatic.; , It's so easy to think about the square footage of a room and completely forget that there's way more to it than that: just look up. If you can get the eye to move up from the floor, you're good to go. Get a tall, simple floor lamp or vase, full-length curtains, and hang your paintings and mirrors the tall way.   This goes for furniture, too. Often streamlined furniture takes up less space but offers all the beauty and comfort of a curved piece.  If your room is small, choose furniture that matches. Go for chairs that take up less space (without arms or thinner legs), loveseats, ottomans, etc. At the end of the day, there will be more space in the room. Consider a bench as opposed to a conventional coffee table; but if a table is more you, go for a glass or lucite one.   However, too many small objects will make it look cluttered. Just because you have smaller objects doesn't permit you to have more of them. Think of it like dieting -- eating a dozen low-fat Popsicles isn't a good idea, even though they're low-fat. Having a dozen small shelves is furniture overkill.  If you have a dark wood floor, this is an especially good idea. A large print carpet, ideally with lines, will open up your space, in addition to brightening it up.   It does not have to take up the entirety of your room. Just a large rug that accompanies the main pieces of furniture will accomplish what you're looking for.  Start seeing double. An oversized ottoman in the center of the seating area can serve as a coffee table with a decorative tray added, while the piece can also double for extra seating. Or, trade a coffee table for a woven trunk with storage space inside.However, when choosing your tables, opt for ones that have wide open legs. Being able to "see through" the furniture makes the room seem larger to the eye.  Select smaller, portable pieces that can be rearranged. Three small end tables grouped as a coffee table are easy to sprinkle around the room to open up traffic flow when entertaining or to clear space for children to play.Utilize the space beneath tables and slide pieces in and out at your leisure. A decorative basket can be seen but still used as storage and taken out when needed.	Choose light colors. Think in lines. Scale down your furniture. Get a large print carpet. Get multifunctional furniture. Choose portable pieces.
Cover the entire work area with wax paper.  Resin drips and splashes will be very difficult to remove, so it's best to avoid the problem completely. You should also protect yourself by wearing rubber or plastic gloves and safety goggles. Always work in a well-ventilated area. Open windows and run fans to prevent the fumes from building up. If you have breathing difficulties, you may even want to wear a respirator designed to block or filter strong fumes.; , Get creative. You can use flat two-dimensional objects and more elaborate three-dimensional objects. Just make sure that your intended arrangement will fit inside the resin mold or bezel.  Popular ideas include broken or re-purposed jewelry, flowers, glitter, sprinkles, transparencies with words printed on them, scraps of fabric, scraps of ribbon, and decorative scrapbook paper. Some objects may not work as well as others, though. For instance, cured resin obscures the facets of loose crystal gems, causing them to disappear inside the piece., Coat the top, bottom, and sides of all porous embellishments with Mod Podge or a similar clear sealant. Let the sealant dry before using the embellishments.Porous embellishments include all papers and fabrics. If you skip this step, these embellishments may discolor. They can also cause more air bubbles to appear in the resin.  When using transparencies and papers, make sure that the size of the piece precisely matches the dimensions of your mold or bezel., Bezels are easiest to work with since you don't need to remove the resin after it cures, but molds give you greater flexibility in design.  Bezels are empty, open-ended charm settings. Once you pour the resin in and let it cure, the piece is finished and ready to attach to a chain. Molds will only allow you to shape the resin. You will need to take additional steps to turn the resin into a pendant or charm before using it as such. Make sure that any molds you use are labeled specifically for use with resin.  If you decide to use a mold, you need to spray the mold with mold release product. Let the mold release dry before continuing.  Do not spray bezels with mold release. Mold release makes it easier for you to remove the finished resin pieces. Since the resin is supposed to stay inside the bezel, you'll want it to remain stuck in place as firmly as possible.  If you decide to use a bezel, cut a piece of thick, sturdy packing tape and carefully stick it onto one side of the bezel.  Make sure that the tape is secure and that there are no gaps between it and that side of the bezel. This is not necessary if you are using a mold or if the bezel is already closed on one side. Only follow this step if you are using a bezel with two open sides.  For best results, choose polyurethane casting resin, not polyester casting resin.Polyester resin is more toxic and tends to retain an odor even after the pieces harden. To make the process easier, you should also make sure that the resin you buy is mixed in a one-to-one ratio with its catalyst.  Fill a small bowl with hot tap water and rest the two bottles inside, keeping the contents of the bottles submerged beneath the level of the water.  Do not use boiling water. Warming the resin and catalyst in this manner makes it easier to mix the two components smoothly. It also reduces the likelihood of dealing with air bubbles.  Combine the resin and catalyst in a small plastic measuring cup, adding equal parts of each. Stir continuously for two minutes using a wooden stick.  Follow the instructions that come with your resin for this step. Some resins may require more or less stirring time. Only mix as much resin as you expect to use. It will not stay in its liquid form for long, so if you make too much, it'll go to waste. Pour the resin in first, then follow it with an equal amount of the catalyst. Use a graduated measuring cup and measure out both components directly inside the cup. Old, clean cough syrup measuring cups work very well for this, but any graduated measuring cup should suffice. Make sure that you use a cup you don't mind sacrificing, though. It can be reused for other resin projects, but you should not reuse this measuring cup for food, drink, or medicine purposes. Stir slowly to prevent air bubbles from building up. Scrape the stick along the edges and bottom of the cup as you stir to ensure thorough, even mixing.  If you want to create clear resin jewelry, no color pigment is needed. If you want to give each piece a tint of color, however, now is the time to add the pigment.Add liquid colors one drop at a time, stirring after each addition. Combine dry pigments with a little resin in a separate cup first, then combine the colored solution with the rest of the clear resin.  Pour enough of the liquid resin mix into the mold or bezel to completely cover the bottom.Work slowly to reduce the number of air bubbles.  Hold a hair dryer or heat gun roughly 4 inches (10 cm) above the resin for a minute or so. Any air bubbles trapped inside should rise to the surface and pop.  Even though you'll be adding another layer of resin later, it's best to remove the air bubbles in this layer now instead of waiting until the end.  Wait 15 minutes or so, allowing the resin in your mold to harden slightly. Carefully place heavy three-dimensional objects on top of the bottom layer using tweezers.  The bottom of the mold or bezel will be the front of your piece, so place the items in upside-down. By placing the heavy embellishments in between layers of resin, you help hold them in place. If you added them without using layers, the pieces would likely move around before the resin sets.  Pour additional resin over the heavy embellishments, covering them completely.  This layer of resin should reach the top of the bezel or mold. You may need to adjust the position of your embellishments with a toothpick if they shift during this time.  If you want a glittery background, sprinkle the glitter over the top of the mold or bezel after filling it with your final layer of resin.  Glitter is small and light, so it should float on the surface of the resin as it dries. Since the top will later become the back of the piece, the glitter will create a background.  If you plan to add any transparencies, dip them in a little leftover resin before placing them in the mold.  Use tweezers to dunk the transparency into the leftover resin in your measuring cup. Quickly dry the resin with your heat gun or hair dryer. Coating the transparencies will help reduce the risk of air bubbles forming between them and the resin in your mold. The bottom of your mold or bezel will end up being the front of your piece, so place the transparency in upside-down.  As before, use your hair dryer or heat gun to gently bring any air bubbles to the surface, where they can pop., If you plan to use a paper background, use tweezers to carefully place the paper over the top of the resin, aligning it as evenly as possible with the opening of the mold or bezel.  Make sure that the paper is upside-down when you place it in so that the decorative side shows from the front of the piece.  Set the filled mold or bezel aside and cover it with a clean box. Allow the resin to cure overnight.  It is important to cover the resin as it cures to protect it from dust or other debris. Curing times can vary, so you'll need to follow the manufacturer's instructions. Only cure it long enough for the resin to be touchable. Do not wait until the resin is fully cured.  Once cured, you should be able to pop the resin pieces out of their molds using your fingers.  If the pieces are still too soft to remove, try placing the mold in your freezer for 10 minutes. That should make it easier to pop the finished pieces out. At this point, the resin piece is ready to work with, but you'll need to take additional steps before you can wear it as jewelry.  If you used a bezel instead of a mold, you will need to peel off the tape from the back of the bezel once the resin cures.  Do not remove the resin from the bezel. At this point, the resin charm is complete and ready to use as wearable jewelry.  Grab the eye of an eye pin with pliers and carefully heat the metal over the flame of a candle or gas stove. Only heat the metal for about 5 seconds.  Work carefully to prevent accidental burns. Use an eye pin that is just a little shorter than the width of the resin piece.  Grab the resin piece with one hand and carefully poke the straight side of the heated eye pin inside.  Press the pin in until it extends roughly halfway through the resin piece. This will only work if the resin is only partially cured. If you allowed it to cure completely, it will be too hard and unyielding.  Once the metal eye pin is cool enough to touch with your bare fingers, slide a small jump ring into the eye.  This completes the project and turns your resin piece into a wearable pendant or charm.  Apply quick hold contact adhesive to the top of the ring mount or pin backing. Press the mount or backing over the center back of your resin piece.  Work quickly to prevent the adhesive from setting before it's attached to the resin. Keep the mount or backing as centered as possible.  Follow the adhesive manufacturer's instructions and let the adhesive set completely.  This step completes the project and turns your resin piece into a wearable ring or brooch.	Prepare your work space. Find embellishments to add. Apply sealant to porous embellishments. Trim everything down to size. Determine whether to use molds or bezels. Coat molds with mold release. Give the bezel a backing. Choose the right type of resin. Place the resin and catalyst bottles in hot water. Combine equal parts resin and catalyst. Add color pigments, if desired. Pour a layer of resin in. Remove any air bubbles. Let the resin harden slightly before adding heavier embellishments. Cover with a final layer of resin. Add glitter, if desired. Coat transparencies in resin before adding them. Remove any air bubbles. Add any paper backgrounds. Let the resin cure. Remove the resin charms from their molds. Remove the backing from bezels. Heat a metal eye pin. Poke the metal into the resin charm. Attach a jump ring to the loop. Glue the mount to the back of the resin. Let dry.
Tallow wax is usually made from beef suet, the fat located next to the cow's kidneys and liver. Suet is mostly clean of gristle and other animal bits.          You can buy an animal fat other than beef suet, but the process might be messier, and it could smell. The process of making wax from suet is time-consuming, so you may want to make a lot at once. Five pounds of fat makes a good amount of wax; buy more if you need more wax, or cut it down if you don't want that much.; , The suet will be melted down, and that process is much faster when you start with fat that is ground, rather than melted whole or in large chunks.  Ask the butcher to grind the fat for you if you are unable to buy it ground. You can grind the fat at home in a grinder or a food processor. Grind it as fine as possible, since smaller bits of fat melt the fastest.	Buy animal fat. Grind the fat.
Evacuation may be the only way to protect your family in a wildfire. Know where to go and what to bring with you. You should plan several escape routes in case roads are blocked by a wildfire.    Make a disaster plan for your family.  Prepare your family for an emergency evacuation.  Prepare an emergency plan for your pets.; , Are roads leading to your property clearly marked? Are the roads wide enough to allow firefighting equipment to get through? Is your house number visible from the roadside?  , All vegetation is fuel for a wildfire, though some trees and shrubs are more flammable than others. To reduce the risk, you will need to modify or eliminate brush, trees and other vegetation near your home. The greater the distance is between your home and the vegetation, the greater the protection. If you live on a hill, extend the zone on the downhill side. Fire spreads rapidly uphill. The steeper the slope, the more open space you will need to protect your home. Swimming pools and patios can be a safety zone and stone walls can act as heat shields and deflect flames. In this zone, you should also do the following:   Remove vines from the walls of the house. Move shrubs and other landscaping away from the sides of the house. Prune branches and shrubs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of chimneys and stove pipes. Remove tree limbs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of the ground. Thin a 15-foot space between tree crowns. Replace highly flammable vegetation such as pine, eucalyptus, junipers and fir trees with lower growing, less flammable species. Check with your local fire department or garden store for suggestions. Replace vegetation that has living or dead branches from the ground-level up (these act as ladder fuels for the approaching fire).  Cut the lawn often keeping the grass at a maximum of 2 inches (5.1 cm). Watch grass and other vegetation near the driveway, a source of ignition from automobile exhaust systems. Clear the area of leaves, brush, evergreen cones, dead limbs and fallen trees.  This zone should begin about 30 feet (9.1 m) from the house and extend to at least 100 feet (30.5 m). In this zone, focus solely on reducing or replacing as much of the most flammable vegetation as possible. If you live on a hill, you may need to extend the zone for several hundred feet to provide the desired level of safety.    Install electrical lines underground, if possible Ask the power company to clear branches from power lines. Avoid using bark and wood chip mulch  Stack firewood 100 feet (30.5 m) away and uphill from any structure.       Store combustible or flammable materials in approved safety containers and keep them away from the house. Keep the gas grill and propane tank at least 15 feet (4.6 m) from any structure. Clear an area 15 feet (4.6 m) around the grill. Place a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) mesh screen over the grill. Always use the grill cautiously but refrain from using it all during high risk times.  Any porch, balcony or overhang with exposed space underneath is fuel for an approaching fire. Overhangs ignite easily by flying embers and by the heat and fire that get trapped underneath. If vegetation is allowed to grow underneath or if the space is used for storage, the hazard is increased significantly. Clear leaves, trash and other combustible materials away from underneath sun decks and porches. Extend 1/2-inch mesh screen from all overhangs down to the ground. Enclose wooden stilts with non-combustible material such as concrete, brick, rock, stucco or metal. Use non-combustible patio furniture and covers. If you're planning a porch or sun deck, use non-combustible or fire-resistant materials. If possible, build the structure to the ground so that there is no space underneath.  Like porches and balconies, eaves trap the heat rising along the exterior siding. Enclose all eaves to reduce the hazard.  Any attic vent, soffit vent, louver or other opening can allow embers and flaming debris to enter a home and ignite it. Cover all openings with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or smaller corrosion-resistant wire mesh. If you're designing louvers, place them in the vertical wall rather than the soffit of the overhang.  Chimneys create a hazard when embers escape through the top. To prevent this, install spark arrestors on all chimneys, stovepipes and vents for fuel-burning heaters. Use spark arrestors made of 12-gauge welded or woven wire mesh screen with openings 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) across. Ask your fire department for exact specifications. If you're building a chimney, use non-combustible materials and make sure the top of the chimney is at least two feet higher than any obstruction within 10 feet (3.0 m) of the chimney. Keep the chimney clean.  Use fire resistant materials in the siding of your home, such as stucco, metal, brick, cement shingles, concrete and rock. You can treat wood siding with UL-approved fire retardant chemicals, but the treatment and protection are not permanent.  Windows allow radiated heat to pass through and ignite combustible materials inside. The larger the pane of glass, the more vulnerable it is to fire. Dual- or triple-pane thermal glass, and fire resistant shutters or drapes, help reduce the wildfire risk. You can also install non-combustible awnings to shield windows and use shatter-resistant glazing such as tempered or wireglass.  This will serve as a temporary water source if the water is shut off. See our articles on building water features.  Use fire-resistant materials when building, renovating, or retrofitting structures. Avoid designs that include wooden decks and patios. Use non-combustible materials for the roof. The roof is especially vulnerable in a wildfire. Embers and flaming debris can travel great distances, land on your roof and start a new fire. Avoid flammable roofing materials such as wood, shake and shingle. Materials that are more fire resistant include single ply membranes, fiberglass shingles, slate, metal, clay and concrete tile. Clear gutters of leaves and debris. You should also contact your local fire department, forestry office, emergency management office or building department for information about local fire laws, building codes and protection measures. Obtain local building codes and weed abatement ordinances for structures built near wooded areas.	Be ready for an emergency evacuation. Determine your community's ability to respond to wildfire. Create a 30-foot safety zone around the house. Create a second zone at least 100 feet (30.5 m) around the house. Clear all combustibles within 30 feet (9.1 m) of any structure. Remove debris from under sun decks and porches. Enclose eaves and overhangs. Cover house vents with wire mesh. Install spark arrestors in chimneys and stovepipes. Use fire resistant siding. Choose safety glass for windows and sliding glass doors. Prepare for water storage; develop an external water supply such as a small pond, well or pool. Keep the following guidelines in mind at the time of construction or remodeling:   Choose locations wisely; canyon and slope locations increase the risk of exposure to wildland fires.
Carnation plants can be rejuvenated by splitting their root masses into separate plants. To do this, dig up an older carnation plant and use your hands to separate it into two. Replant the divided parts and give them a good watering.   You should not let the plant dry out until it is established.  Carnations grow well from cuttings. You may find that a cutting is a good way to replace plants once they are past their prime, which is usually when they reach two to three years of age. It’s important to only propagate from healthy ‘parent’ plants. To make a cutting:   Cut a non-flowering piece of one of your plant’s shoots. Try to do this first thing in the morning if you can. This cutting should be about four inches long.       Cut below a leaf node using a very sharp, clean blade. The shoot should be recent growth from the same year. Remove the lower leaves.       Dip the cut into a rooting hormone and then plant it halfway down a planter that has been filled with coarse sand.       Water, then place a clear plastic bag around the plant.       Place this in a bright spot out of direct sunlight, such as a window ledge that does not get full sun. Maintain moisture until the plants are established and you can see growth.  Carnations can also be propagated by a method called ‘layering’. To do this, prepare the soil around the plant you wish to propagate as you would for planting a cutting (mixing in sand to compost or peat, then watering the area).Next:   Find a healthy side shoot and strip off the lowest leaves. Halfway along the length make a vertical slit in the stem with a sharp knife.       Bend the stem over and plant the cut midsection into the ground. A good tip is to use a bit of wire or a hairpin to anchor it in the soil. It will eventually root from the cut bit of the stem.       Keep the soil moist for about six weeks, then you can cut it from the parent. Leave it for another month before relocating it.	Try dividing your carnations to rejuvenate and propagate your plant. Consider trying to take cutting of your plant if you’d rather not divide it. Try layering to propagate your carnations.
Theses damping materials absorb sound waves, eliminate resonance, and diminish vibrations.   Damping mats: These are simple to install damping materials and are used to cover panels in your car to help with sound deadening. They are typically made of either stryene-butyadine rubber or asphaltic panes with adhesive backing and either lower the resonant frequency of the panel, or transform the sound vibrations into heat depending on the damping material used in your particular mats. Sprays: These come in either professional cans requiring compressors and paint guns for application or easy to use aerosol cans. Sprays are used in situations where matting would be too bulky to fit or the weight of the matting would be too heavy such as door panels or kick panels. Foams: Foams come in either sheet or spray form. The foam sheets are used just as the damping mats are by laying them over car panels to absorb vibration. Instead of converting the vibrations to heat, as the mats do, the foam sheets dispersing the energy throughout the sheet. Insulation: This damping material is a thick pane of fibers that absorb sound and is laid underneath the carpet. The most typical type of insulation is jute or micro jute. Although insulation is less effective in regard to sound deadening, is does add thermal insulation to the interior of your car as well as creates a plusher carpet  , This will help with the panel's tendency to vibrate causing unwanted noise. , The mats contain metal foil backing in order to increase the mat's heat resistance making them able to be near the heat of the engine. Apply them using a contact adhesion glue found at your local auto shop.	Choose damping materials in which you plan to dampen your car with such as mats, foams, sprays, or insulation; it is recommended to use a combination of these products in order to achieve maximum damping. Add weight to panels using damping mats. Place the damping mats between 2 of the door panels that are in close proximity to each other, to help reduced the vibrations within the space between the 2 door panels.  , Place the damping mats inside an engine compartment to reduced rattling noises.
For the optimum security, your home needs to be outfitted with strong deadbolts and door locks to keep your stuff and your family safe. You can do this yourself, as door locks are easy and inexpensive to replace. Once you do, always lock them and instruct your family to always lock them.   It's possible that older residents likely have kept a copy of your key, so it's good to change the locks if you've just moved in, to help prevent theft.; , Having an alarm reduces the likelihood of a break-in, and makes the effects of a break-in much more minor. You can engage the alarm when you're away, as well as setting it to night or stay mode, for your own safety while you're in for the night. Invest in a system that will alert the police (or fire station) immediately and your home phone should receive a call from them asking if everything is all right.   Shop around for the best monthly monitoring prices. The brands you probably know from television cost four times per month more than other companies that are probably local to you. Knowing the pricing of other companies will help you negotiate a lower rate. Be sure to use the alarm each time you go out, and change the code every year or two, using something hard to guess but easy to remember for the code. If the alarm company offers signs for windows or lawn, use them. The whole idea is to make your home less attractive for an easy theft.  You can help prevent theft at your home by putting a clear thick window film on your ground floor and basement windows to keep them from breaking-in. There are clear, frosted and reflective (mirrored) films, depending on your privacy needs. This is commonly used in earthquake country to prevent shattering, and is also useful to resist a break-and-enter type of theft.  Help your neighborhood by getting to know the cars and habits of your neighbors. This may seem like a little thing, but thieves really do target places where they think they are blending in or not noticed. Once they know someone is very aware of them, they will feel uncomfortable and will quickly move on. As you probably can't be home all the time, this works best if you can encourage your neighbors to do the same.   If you see someone strange or a strange vehicle near your house, go out and offer to help them with directions (pretend to think that they are lost) or otherwise engage them "how are you, how is your day." Be polite and never challenge them ("what are you doing here") as a confrontation could be a risk to safety. A thief will talk as little as possible and then move on to the next neighborhood.  If they arrive at your door, go outside to talk with them, locking your door behind. Many thieves use some excuse to come into the home to get some idea of what to steal. Going outside will help deter them. If they ask, politely say no.   If they claim to be from your town government, ask to see ID first and take their picture using your mobile phone. A real government official won't be upset by this and may even congratulate you on being safe. Always document strangers who come around or seem suspicious in some way. Take a quick picture just to have it in case something happens in the future.  Dogs, even small dogs and docile animals, can help to deter theft. Thieves don't want to mess with potential dog-alarms and bites. If you're concerned about security at your home, consider investing in a family pet who will have the added benefit of barking its head off any time someone comes around with ill intent. This can help you feel safe and provide you with an added layer of security.  Be sure to put away bicycles, radios or anything of value away when you're not using them or done for the day to reduce their visibility to the passerby. Expensive tools, shoes and other things should never be left out where they could be easily taken.  Never leave coins, paper money, wallets, radios, mobile phones or computers visible through the windows of your car. Take them inside and store them properly. This can encourage vehicle theft, and possibly more.  There's no need to broadcast that you've got a big plasma screen television inside and a new Macbook sitting on your desk. Thieves will be much less interested in gambling with what you've got inside if they can't see it. There's no sense in drawing attention to what you've got.  If you are one of the lucky ones with a garage and you keep anything like tools, bicycle or expensive vehicles in it, keep it closed most of the time to prevent anyone passing by taking mental inventory of what you have as incentive to possibly break in later.  Increase night visibility around your home by employing outdoor lighting. Modern LEDs are waterproof and use much less wattage than conventional outdoor lighting.  Consider removing any bushes that are growing against the home providing hiding spots. If you have a fence, keep the gates closed and put up no trespassing signs, which suggests to thieves that you're taking security seriously.  Don't publish personal information such as your telephone number, address, and detailed lists of things you own and your daily activity. If you let everyone know you're out of the town for three days, your new stereo could become an attractive theft option.   If you post a picture in the place you live, be careful not to let the GPS turned on, so everybody will find out where you live.	Change your home's exterior door locks. Consider getting an alarm system installed. Have anti-shatter plastic installed on your windows. Keep an eye out for your neighbors. Never invite strangers into your home. Get a dog. Keep things inside. Take things out of your car. Keep your blinds closed. Keep your garage door closed. Keep your home well-lit. Eliminate hiding spots around your home. Be careful on the Internet.
The tins that cookies come in a perfect for this. If you cannot find such a tin, arts and crafts stores sell very similar ones.  Wash the box with soap and warm water, and dry it off. If you plan on painting the box, wipe it down with a cotton ball soaked with rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oil residue that might prevent paint from sticking.   This would be a good idea even for store-bought boxes that never held cookies.  The designs on a cookie tin can give your sewing box some old-fashioned charm, but you can paint it if you don't like the design or color. Take the lid off the box, and spray paint both with a primer. Wait for the primer to dry, then spray paint it using your favorite color. If you need to apply a second coat, wait for the first one to dry before applying it.   Try to apply the primer and paint lightly. It is better to do many light coats than one thick coat. Thick coats are more likely to create drips and puddles. Avoid painting the inside of the box. The paint will get scratched off by the objects inside.  You will be using these measurements to make your grid.  Try to use a stiffer or thicker cardboard for this; it will be more durable and less likely to lose its shape.  You can match the color to the outside of the box, or use a completely different color for contrast.  Find the center of each strip. Cut a notch halfway into the strip. The notch should be about the same thickness as the cardboard you are using. This will give you four large compartments.   If you want more compartments, cut more strips of cardboard and more notches. You will need to trim down some of the strips in order to fit them inside the box.  Form a cross with the strips. Make sure that the notches are facing each other, then slide them into place. If your grid is too wobbly, draw a line of glue along the seams. This will strengthen it. Try to use a liquid glue that dries clear.  If you want to glue it down, draw a line of glue along the bottom and side edges, then slide the grid into place. To make it stronger, draw a line of glue along the seams.   If you gave your divider more compartments, you will need to cut them shorter until the divider fits inside the box.  The box will be too small to store large items, such as scissors, but it is perfect for smaller items, such as ribbon, thread, and needles. Consider storing like items with like items. For example:   Place your needles, sewing pins, and pin cushions in the first compartment. Place your ribbon, lace, and hem tape in the second compartment. Put the buttons, hooks, and clasps in a third compartment. Use the last compartment for zippers and elastic. For ideas on what to fill your box with, click here.  Because your box doesn't have a clasp, adding a handle would be a bad idea, but you can still make the box look pretty on top. Glue on some sewing-related embellishments on the lid, such as buttons and pretty brooches. Decorate the sides with lace and ribbon.	Find a round, metal tin. Clean the box, then paint it. Consider painting the box. Measure the inside height and diameter of the box. Cut two strips of cardboard according to that measurement. Paint the cardboard strips, or cover them with fabric or paper. Cut a notch into the cardboard strips. Put the strips together. Put the divider into the box. Fill the box. Consider decorating the lid of your box.
For this project, you will need thirty or more pieces of plain white paper, tape, scrap paper or newspaper, construction paper or thin poster board in the color of your choice, scissors, and ordinary glue in a squeeze bottle. You will need a flat surface to work on. Because you are using glue, you may want to cover your surface in newspaper before beginning.   If you want to decorate your shield, you’ll also need markers, paint, stencils, glitter, or any other decorating materials. Keep in mind that this specific shield is made entirely out of paper products, so there may be better DIY options for anyone looking for an extremely sturdy, polished shield.; , You will want to create about thirty in total. These tubes will create the width of the shield. This requires slow and steady work, so take your time! This step will probably be the most time-consuming step of this craft.Start at the corner of the paper, and roll diagonally. Roll it tightly, so that it ends up about the width of a chopstick. Once you’ve rolled the paper completely, tape down the remaining loose corner. This will require about thirty sheets, but you may end up using slightly more or less.  They may vary slightly in length, but that’s perfectly fine. Line them up side by side so that they form a rectangle. To envision what you are creating, think of the wall of a log cabin. It’s created of logs laying side by side. The tubes will be forming a three-dimensional rectangle, like the wall of a log cabin., Take long strips of tape and lay them across the tubes. Once the tubes are all held together pretty well, you can add reinforcement by wrapping long pieces of tape across the front and around to the back. Make sure that you are taping the top, bottom, front, and back of the tubes evenly. Do this repeatedly, and use a lot of tape, until the tubes form one study rectangle that you can pick up and gently shake without any coming loose.  You'll need to tear enough paper to cover the surface of your shield. It doesn’t matter what kind of paper you use or the size of strips you create in this step, because it won’t show anywhere when the shield is completed. This paper will simply be used to create a flat surface between the paper tubes and the decorated paper you will eventually be placing on top., Spread a thin layer of glue evenly over the paper tubes. Ordinary squeezable Elmer’s glue will do the trick. Glue the torn strips of paper all over the tubes. Only one side of the tubes needs to be covered, and don’t worry about covering the sides of the tubes. Make sure all of the tubes are covered by scrap paper. Let this dry completely., You can use either construction paper or thin poster board for this step. Obviously, the shield will be larger and more heavy-duty if you use poster board, but you will also need to create more paper tubes for the backing. This colored paper will be used to cover the paper tube structure you’ve created.Large sheets of paper work great, but you can also simply tape regular size sheets together.  To make sure that the design you create will fit onto the tube structure you’ve created, you may want to lay down the tube structure first and trace around it. Then, you can draw any shape you desire within the outline of the tubes. Once you’ve traced your shield onto the colored paper, cut it out.You can use a traditional shield shape, a circle, or find a unique shield design online. Shields can be pointed, rounded, simple, or intricate. Different shapes and styles can designate different time periods or geographic regions, so you can put some thought into the design you choose., Taking a pencil, lightly trace the outline of the shield onto the side of the tubes covered by the newspaper strips. The surface may be slightly bumpy from the tubes, so go slow and get the best outline you can. After you’ve traced the shield onto the tube structure, use the scissors to cut the shape.Complete this step slowly and carefully. Since you’ll be cutting through the taped together tubes, this can be kind of tricky. You can cut out the general shield shape, and then clean up any sloppy edges afterwards. Lay your colored shield outline onto the tube structure to make sure they are both the same shape.  It is easiest to do this before you glue it onto the tubes, because you can draw, paint, stamp, or write on a flat surface. Get creative! You can draw a picture, create a bold outline, write something, or anything else you desire.   One popular shield design is a family crest. You can find your family crest using a Google search, but be aware that you may find several different ones for your name., The paper shield and the tubes should be in the exact same shape, but you can trim the tubes if they do not line up perfectly. Remember to glue the shield onto the side of the tubes covered by newspaper. Put a flat, heavy object on top of the shield as it dries, so that it dries smoothly and firmly., If you've created a pretty large, heavier shield, you may want to use poster board for this step. If you used regular paper for your entire shield, than a few stacked sheets of regular paper should work fine for your handle. Use your judgment to choose which material will best support the weight of the shield you've already created.If you are using poster board, simply cut a rectangle about the length of a standard piece of paper. The width should be a width that you can comfortable wrap your hand around. If you choose to use sheets of paper, line them up evenly. Then, begin rolling the stack length-wise. The width of the final rolled strip should be about one inch, or whatever width you can grip comfortably.  Taking a pencil, make dashes on the surface on either side of your hand, so that you’ve marked the width of your hand. This step is necessary so that the handle is wide enough for you to grip. Remove your hand, and fold the strip where you’ve made the marks, creating a handle shape.To help you visualize this, imagine folding the paper into a geometric U-shape. The trough of the U is where you will be gripping the handle, and the tips of the U will be where the handle attaches to the shield.  To do this, you will need to create two more folds at the ends of the paper, flattening the ends so they can be taped down to the surface of the shield. You can place it directly in the middle of the shield, or wherever you prefer holding it. Use several strips of tape so that it is very sturdy. If your handle falls off during battle, your shield will be useless!	Gather your materials. Roll the plain white paper into tubes. Lay all of the tubes flat on a surface. Tape all of the paper tubes together. Tear spare newspaper into strips. Glue the paper strips onto the tubes. Choose what color you want your shield to be. Trace the outline of your shield onto the colored paper. Lay the cut out shield onto your paper tubes. Decorate the shield on the colored paper. Glue the decorated paper shield onto the cut tubes. Create your handle. Lay your hand across the paper or poster board. Tape the handle onto the back of your shield.
A plié refers to a stance in which you bend your knees outward while keeping your legs straight. Bend both legs so that you are almost at a deep lunge. Lift the back heel off the ground to prepare to initiate your movement into the turn.Stand with feet flat on the floor without bearing weight on either the inside or the outside of our foot. Make sure your weight is centered over the ball of your foot so as not to disrupt your alignment. Work on the angle between your feet as it will depend on the natural rotation of your hips. Once your feet are positioned, align your knees between your second and third toes and initiate the movement.; , Your arms will give you momentum to complete the turn. As you initiate your turn you want to close your arms into a circle as if you are holding a round beach ball. They should be straight out in front of your chest with your hands facing with palms inward and thumbs aligned., As you lift your back leg place your foot above the knee of your straight leg with your toe pointed toward the ground and turn. The one legged stance is known as relevé. Remember to keep your back straight and arms in a circle in front of you as you turn., Spotting is when you pick an item just above your eyeline that you focus on as you turn your head. This keeps your head straight and level as you turn. The quicker you spot, the quicker your turn will be. Hold your gaze as long as possible to help keep your balance., Once you’ve mastered the fundamentals for a single pirouette, move on to multiple pirouettes by keeping your momentum and focusing on your form. You cannot achieve multiple pirouettes without first learning the basics of a single one., Your core should be completely engaged to complete each pirouette. Focus on having proper balance and correct alignment. Picture being pulled up from the top of your head by an invisible string to a high relevé.   Strengthen your core with exercises like yoga, pilates, ballet, and jazz dance.  Spotting is exactly as it sounds as you turn your head and spot a point to turn your head in the direction you want to pirouette in. In order to achieve neat, quick turns your head must follow suit with a sharp, quick head turn. Spot a point slightly above your eye line, which will lift your chin as you turn.   If you look at the floor you will fall. Your pirouette will follow your line of sight as it helps you keep your balance.  Your hips should be aligned with your shoulders as you complete each pirouette. Your balance will be off as you turn if your alignment is off. Use a mirror as you stand in relevé to ensure that your shoulders and hips are aligned.   Check your side stance as well when you are at the mirror to ensure that you’re not leaning too far forward or back.  The base of each pirouette will be balanced on relevé so focus on keeping this balance without turning. You should be able to balance on relevé for several seconds otherwise you won’t be able to stay up during your pirouettes. Build your strength by balancing on each leg for 8 seconds or more. Try to balance as long as you can each time you practice.   Practice different turns to improve your balance such as turned-out retire, non-turned-out jazz pirouette, and turns in a la seconde. Changing up your turns will improve your balance. Compete with your friends to make practicing more fun. See who can hold their balance the longest.  Retire is a pose in ballet where your raise one leg to the side and bend the knee of that leg so that your toe points to make the sole of your foot parallel to the knee of your other leg. Your toe on your raised leg should be glued to the knee of your straight leg. If your toe drops below your knee as you pirouette, your turn will also drop. Your toe will pull your weight down so keep it level to your knee with your toe pointed. Not pointing your toe looks sloppy and ruins your form.  Give each pirouette energy by pushing off the floor from a deep plié position. Imagine that you are a spring so that you are ready to bounce up when pushed down. Give each pirouette momentum as you push yourself up from the ground. Control your force as you don’t want to push with too much energy that it throws off your coordination.   You want a deep plié for a powerful turn. Try breathing out as you plié to increase your power.  Make sure to wear proper footwear as it is difficult to execute multiple pirouettes barefoot because your feet will stick to the floor. You may also get a painful burn. There are special dance shoes designed specifically for pirouettes that you can purchase online or at your local dance store. These shoes enhance your natural arch will provide the traction needed to turn efficiently.  Keep the energy close to your body by crossing your palms over each other and keeping your arms close in a tight and neat circle. Make sure that your arms are connected to your back and shoulder blades by pretending that there is a rod that keeps your shoulder blades and upper back wide and open.   If your arms open from a tight and neat circle the energy and weight will be dispersed and through off your coordination.  Do not turn your supporting foot before you initiate the turn by allowing your other foot to take off.Your hip and shoulder will open too early and your arms will lag behind. Push off your back toes to initiate the turn and keep your leg turned in. Keep your core in one piece as you use your arms as a steering while to guide your core around the turn.You know your coordination is off if you feel out of control or like you are in the spin cycle of your washing machine.  Spot before you turn and do not change it. Changing your spot as you turn will throw you off. If you spot too slowly or too fast your rotation will suffer. Think of the music when you need to spot; then, spot, hold, and follow through., Poor alignment can come from sitting on your supporting side, lifting your working hip, or throwing your upper body back. Think about squaring your hips and shoulders, keeping your core engaged, and keeping your legs strong under you. Push down on your supporting leg as you lift the other to follow through in your turn under balance., Practice fundamentals and technique. Don’t develop bad habits. Focus on every movement and the correct function of each part of your body. Use a mirror to help with form. Practice with friends to help support each other.   Avoid changing your focal mid spot or spotting too slowly. This will throw off your coordination and balance. Make sure you keep your core engaged and keep your body in a straight line. It’s easy to fall into the bad habit of tilting or slouching if you don’t focus on keeping your body pulled up.	Start with a plié. Open your arms. Lift your back leg and initiate your turn. Focus on spotting. Move on to multiple pirouettes. Pull up and keep your core engaged. Spot quickly. Keep proper alignment. Keep your balance on relevé. Position your toe correctly when you retire. Use the floor. Wear appropriate footwear. Pull in your arms for tighter turns. Focus on coordination. Determine where you’re spotting. Keep your balance. Practice as much as your schedule allows.
Cedar is a good choice, since it is free of preservatives and naturally resists rot and decay. Plus, it is easier to work with than hardwoods or tightly grained softwoods such as pine that are more likely to warp and split.; , The one in this illustration is 18 inches (46cm) wide, 22 inches (56cm) long, but the final size depends upon your needs.  These pieces will be the main supports, serving as both the mounting frame for the wheel and for the handles, so choosing good lumber is important.  Scribe a pair of parallel lines on the thicker end so you will have a pocket for the wheel/axle assembly to mount in.  Then scribe a block to fasten the two handles together, staying back about 12 inches (30cm) from the end you are using for the wheel mount.  Three layers will give you a wheel about 2 inches (5cm) thick, using two 1 X 6 inch (2.5cm x 15cm) planks will allow you to cut a wheel 11 inches (28cm) in diameter, as shown in the illustrations.  Then cut it out with a jigsaw or band saw.  A 1/2 inch (1.5cm) galvanized rod will give you a fairly stout axle. Put a nut on the all-thread, running it down about 3 inches (7.5cm), then add a flat washer. Thread your rod through one handle, and start a nut on the end where it passes through the handle. Tighten it so that it pulls into the wood if possible, to make it stationary.  Add another washer, then another nut, before allowing it to pass through the second handle. Add a final nut on the outside of the second handle, and tighten it securely. Make sure the space between the wheel and its washer spacers is fairly tight, but not too tight, so the wheel cannot wobble.  You can begin by laying this assembly on the inverted box and marking the edges of the handles so you can fit the next piece in the correct location.  Lay them on the lines you marked earlier and fasten them with wood screws.  Add your legs and braces, using 2 X 2 inch (5cm x 5cm) material scribed on the angle of the handles so that they support the wheelbarrow in the position you want. You can let these legs run wild (cut longer than needed) so you can trim them when you have completed the project.  You can now set the wheelbarrow right side up and check it to make sure it sits correctly. There are a number of simple ways of adjusting the way the wheelbarrow sets, including adding wedges underneath the box, and trimming the support legs.  You can line the wheelbarrow box with plastic to give it more protection from moisture if you are going to use it for a planter, but if you use a good, exterior grade wood, it should last for a long time with just a sealer on it.	Select the wood you want to use for your wheelbarrow. Build a simple, basic box suitable for your needs. Rip two pieces of sound 2 inch (5cm) thick lumber on a taper from about 1 1/4 inches to 2 inches (3cm to 5cm) and around 4 feet (1.2 meters) long. Lay these handles on a table, placing them at an angle that will allow the grip ends to be spread apart far enough for you to use them, and with the wide end almost touching. Cut these two lines with a circular saw. Build your wheel by gluing and screwing layers of 1 inch (2.5cm) thick boards together at opposite angles. Scribe a circle on the blank you built for building the wheel. Drill the handle frame and the center of the wheel to accommodate an all-thread rod. Place a washer on the rod, then pass it through the wheel. Install the handle/wheel assembly on the bottom of the box you built earlier. Cut two wedges from 2 x 4 inch (5cm x 10cm) material, the same length as the box. Lay your wheel and handle assembly on these wedges, and screw them in place. Cut and install a cross brace between the wheelbarrow support legs to keep it from wobbling. Sand edges smooth if desired, and seal or paint the wheelbarrow with an exterior coating.
The two grips that come in a package have slightly different-sized holes. The one that is slightly larger is meant to be installed on the side of the throttle, which is usually the right side. The smaller one should be installed on the side without the throttle.  Apply a grip glue, such as E-6000, inside the hand grip opening and along the handlebar. The edge of one side of the grip is raised, while the other edge is not. Slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, before the glue begins to dry. Keep pushing until the raised edge of the grip is flush against the inside of the handlebar. When it's secure in place, squeeze the grip to help the glue set.          Don't use too much adhesive; apply just enough to hold the grip in place. If you use too much adhesive it will squeeze out the ends of the grip and make a mess. Make sure to work quickly enough that the glue doesn't dry before you replace the grip. If it becomes hard to work with, use rubbing alcohol to remove the grip glue and start over. If you don't have grip glue, try the hairspray method, advocated by many seasoned motorcyclists.  Apply the glue to the grip meant for the throttle side as well as the handlebar. Quickly slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, until it is flush against the inside of the handlebar. Squeeze the grip to help the glue set.  Screw the ends of the handlebars back on so that the grips are held firmly in place.  Wait several hours for the glue to dry before using the motorcycle. When it's dry, test the grips to make sure you like them. If you find them to be uncomfortable, replace them using the same method.	Sort out which grip goes on which side. Install the non-throttle grip. Install the throttle grip. Replace the bar ends. Let the glue dry.
A multimeter is a small hand held device that can be used to measure voltage, resistance, and amperage. Each model will only be rated to handle a certain amount of current, and this rating needs to be adequate for the electrical system you want to test. For example, running 200 amps through a multimeter rated for 10 amps will ruin the multimeter's fuse. The amperage rating will be printed on the unit or in the owner's manual.; , Most multimeters have functions for measuring several different quantities. To measure amperage, you need to set the function to either measure AC amperage or DC amperage, depending on the electrical system you are testing. The power source for your system will determine the type of current. For example, household power is AC, while power from a battery is DC.  To ensure that you don't blow your device's fuse, set the maximum amperage sensitivity to well above your expected reading. You can adjust this downward if the multimeter does not read anything when hooked into your system.  Your multimeter should come with 2 cords, each with a probe on 1 end and a lead on the other. Plug both cords into the correct terminals for measuring amperage; the owner's manual will specify the correct terminals if they are not labeled clearly.  This is extremely dangerous and can cause electrical shock if measuring household AC or other high voltage or high amperage sources or even lower sources. Turn off all breakers before working with this and use an AC current sense probe to see if AC is absolutely off before touching any wires especially bare ones. Do not work in a wet environment on even a high humidity one. This can conduct electricity and hurt you. Wear heavy rubber gloves. Additional precautions may be necessary. Consult a real electrical workbook (not an online source) before attempting this. Assume wires can have missing insulation from accidental damage during installation or old age. Missing insulation can cause electrical shock. Always have someone ready with a cell phone who is not touching you who can call an Emergency number in case of worst case scenario. This person should also be trained in first aid and CPR. If electrical shock occurs, this person may have to remove you using some type of insulated material (a dry article of clothing for example but something else may need to be used) or else that person will also undergo shock due to the conductivity of skin and maybe some clothing (and other materials). Always consult a real electrical safety book before attempting this and know what type of signal you are dealing with. Consult a real electrical manual before attempting this about the dangers involved and how to prevent them (not an online source). Clip the wire in a single spot and strip back the insulation on both exposed ends. Secure these ends separately to the leads of the amp meter. Only do the measurement after the wires are securely attached to the amperage meter probes. Make sure these wires especially the exposed ends cannot touch you. Turn back on the breaker and adjust the meter sensitivity if no reading is produced.  Follow the precautions outlined in step 5 and consult a real electrical book (not an online source) for safety precautions. After taking your reading, you will need to complete the broken circuit again. It is much safer to do this by buying and installing new wire rather than trying to patch the area where you cut it.	Determine the amperage rating for your digital multimeter. Select the appropriate function on your multimeter. Set the range on your multimeter. Plug the leads into the appropriate terminals. Run the circuit through the multimeter to measure the current. Turn off the breaker and use an AC current sense probe to make sure AC is off and then and only then rewire the circuit.
Your idol may be a relatively unknown but up-and-coming author who’s set to sign books at Barnes & Nobles next month in your city. Here’s your change to meet her! Book signings are also a great way to meet both world figures and celebrities. Increasingly, celebrities are writing memoirs and actresses and actors are appearing at signings that coincide with the openings of the movies they starred in from that particular book series.In almost all cases, you are required to buy the book from the bookstore hosting the signing, so make sure you bring along enough money to buy one. Consider buying more than one book, so you have extra time with your idol. To find out if your idol is having a book signing for a recently published book, look for a social media announcement from your idol; go to the publisher's website and its social media sites; look on major retailers' websites like Barnes & Noble; and talk with local bookstores, particularly if you live in a major metropolitan area., In case you’ve always wondered but never thought to ask, VIP means “very important person.” You can be one, too, for the right price. Usually, that price is high. Yet purchasing VIP tickets to concerts, plays, comedy shows, the ballet and sporting events come with a variety of perks. One of those perks is often a “meet and greet pass.” Depending upon the event, this could mean you meet your idol or that you meet someone or several people that are part of, for example, a ballet troupe or a baseball team. This could include your idol.You also often get a photograph as a part of VIP packages, and, in some cases, much more, such as invites to pre- or post-event parties. Make sure that you read the details carefully. You can get VIP tickets in a number of ways – from ticketing services like VIPNation.com, Ticketmaster.com, VIPTickets.com, Premiumseatsusa.com and from the venues and organizations themselves. Not all events will have VIP tickets, and you’ll want to buy them either through pre-sales offers or within minutes of tickets going on sale for many events.  Often, joining an official fan club is free, and with some you can get one of the most coveted perks of belonging to a fan club – being included in a lottery or drawing to win a meet and greet pass after you buy a ticket to a show or event. Frequently, however, this opportunity is only available when you upgrade your membership, or pay for a higher level. Plenty of fan clubs, however, are not free for even basic membership. Many of these, such as certain major league sports team fan clubs, will go beyond basic meet and greets and include invitations to dinners and other events.Some of the other benefits of upgrading and paying for fan clubs include access to dress rehearsals and practices where you might get more than a handshake and a photo, online chats and conference calls and dibs on pre-sales tickets (which can help get VIP tickets)., While major movie awards programs like the Golden Globes and the Oscars are virtually impossible to get tickets to, even for those in the industry, others such as the BET Music Awards are possible. These, along with movie premieres and film festivals, give you an opportunity to potentially meet countless celebrities.If your idol is less well known, see if he or she has a website that lists upcoming speaking events or performances nearby or in your area. Some may even be free. Here’s a good site for finding tickets for movie premieres, film festivals and awards shows: thevipconcierge.com.  This might be leaning to the stalker side, but if you know that your idol works out a particular gym, for instance, you might consider joining the same gym. If you know that your idol always attends Lakers games and sits in a specific spot, you might try to get seats nearby. If, for example, your idol is your town’s former mayor, and she eats at the same diner every Wednesday for lunch, you might eat there as well. Strike up a conversation and offer to pay for her lunch!	Go to book signings. Buy VIP tickets. Pay for fan clubs or upgraded fan-club levels. Attend movie premieres, awards programs, film festivals and other ticketed events. Do what your idol does.
You can find junkyards in area by:   Looking in your phone book. Check the yellow pages under “Auto Parts” or “Junkyards”. Doing an online search. Check local business listings online using directories such as Yellow Pages, Yahoo Local or run a search for used auto parts or junkyards using your favorite search engine. , To do this, take the vehicle and title to the junkyard, sign the title over to whomever the junkyard requests, and take your cash.   Be sure to have a friend follow, so you have a way home! If the car does not run, you will need the junkyard or an independent tow truck service, whom you pay, to two the car to the yard for you. Call and ask if the junkyard provides tow service, and if not, shop around for the best deal on a private tow.	If you are not eligible for a tax deduction, make a list of local junkyards. Call each junkyard on your list and ask how much they will pay you for your car.  , Donate your car to the junkyard that offers to pay the most.
It’s possible to get quite creative when using natural materials for creating lawn edging. Stone or wood make good choices. For the most natural effect you don’t want these to be too uniform, so choose rough-looking wood such as reclaimed railway sleepers or uneven shapes of natural stone.; , Stone tends to be an expensive choice of edging material and it is laborious to put in place.   It’s also harder to avoid damaging the lawnmower or knocking the stones out of place when mowing. This usually means you’ll get a less neat finish after mowing.       A trimmer may help, or consider hand-trimming the edges to tidy them up.  If you are using wood to edge your garden, make sure it’s been pressure treated or that a preservative has been applied to it. This will ensure a longer life.   If you are using reclaimed wood such as railway sleepers, check they are plant safe. Some wood can be contaminated with chemicals that will negatively affect plants.       If you plan to use the sleepers for sitting on or for eating off, make sure they aren’t sticky with creosote. Creosote will ruin your clothes and emit unpleasant smells.  Plants can also be used to create a natural visual edge to define your borders. You’ll need to select something low-growing and fairly compact. Dwarf Perennial Lavender makes a good choice, as does Thyme, Speedwell or Geranium.   It will be necessary to keep these plants well-trimmed or you may not get a uniform look. You will also have the issue of how to mow the lawn right to the edges without damaging the edging plants. You might like to use plant edging in combination with another type of edging such as trench edging. Plant the edging plants so they conceal whatever edging material you are using.	Choose wood and stone materials that look as natural as possible. Be aware that stone can be expensive and difficult to install. Choose wooden materials that have been treated and preserved. Choose low-growing, compact plants as edging materials.
Bending guitar strings are how you put personality into your notes, taking basic scales like the blues pentatonic and molding it to fit your unique musical ideas. Bends, appropriately, are a way to add "tone color" to your playing. They are accent notes, used for emphasis and improvisation.          All of the techniques and rules here should be, to pardon the pun, bent. Experiment with bends and strings to get the tones you want for your playing.; , You can, of course, bend with any finger you want. However, using your ring finger will allow you to put the middle and index fingers behind the fret as well, giving you three fingers to help bend the strings instead of one.          The thicker your strings, the harder they are to bend. As such, acoustic guitars are often harder to bend, and you'll need 2-3 fingers to really manipulate the string.  Keeping your fingers firmly in place, use your whole hand to bend the notes. The power comes from your forearm, which you should feel moving as you bend. Think of it as turning your wrist to push your index finger, and thus the string, as high as you can.  Bends are almost always simply notated, whether you're reading tab or a guitar score. A bend, remember, makes your note higher pitched. As such, all written music tells you wen to bend, and how high to bend the note -- telling you which fret the note should sound like when bent the right amount. The following two methods of writing bends are the most common:           Tab: Usually written with a "b" for bend an a "r" for release, when the bend ends:  G|---------4b5r4------| would mean "bend the 4th fret up so it sounds like the 5th fret, then release back to the 4th."    Guitar scores: Will have a small upward arrow drawn on the staff, like the one in the video. It will tell you how far to bend the note, as well as when to come back down.  Half-bends only go up one fret. Full-bends go up two frets. Over bends push the note three frets or higher.	Use bends for a unique, bluesy way to transition between notes. Hold down the note you want to bend with your ring finger. Pivot your wrist up and away from your body to bend. Learn how to read bends in written guitar music.
This will bring up the options that you can use with it.   For example, this particular Fontwork Gallery, uses the Fontwork toolbar and the 3D Settings toolbar.; , It is in the Drawing Object Properties toolbar. This will bring up all of the various options that you have for your chosen artwork.  Things that you will want to take into consideration are:       The color of your paper that you will be using The readability of it. 3D effects are all well and good, but really pay attention and see if it is legible. ,	Once you have changed the words of your Fontwork artwork, then single click on it. Click on the paint bucket. Experiment with various looks until you get what you want. Take your time and if you find a look you like, consider saving it and continuing on in your search.      ,Depending on what you are using it for, remember that simpler is usually better.
Fold the excess fabric down, angling the fold either outward or inward. Pin the fold into place. For a scalloped neckline, pin the fold inwards. For a v-neck, pin outwards.  Hand sew the fold so the sewing is less prominent.  Pin them to the fabric and then sew them.  Fold the open edges inward just a little.  Hold the fold to make sure that it stays even. Tuck the fabric of the bodice inside the tube and pin it down '  ,, Tie the tube ties around your neck and zip up the zipper.	Put the dress on and place your hand on the excess fabric above the bust. Take the dress off and sew the fold into place. Fold down the raw edges of the shirt around the arm opening. Take the straps that you sewed earlier. Pin the straps to the shirt onto the top corners of the bodice. Sew the tubes onto the fabric.  , Wear the dress.
Many factory car alarms are designed to turn off when in proximity to the appropriate key or key fob. You may be able to shut your car alarm down simply by inserting your key into the lock on the driver’s side door, locking it, and unlocking it again. Because the car is being unlocked by the appropriate key, it may send a signal to the alarm that it can shut down.While the passenger side door may work, it is more likely it will work on the driver’s side. If the door is already locked, simply unlock it. If the alarm doesn’t stop, try locking it an unlocking it again.; , Using a similar methodology to the key method, unlocking the vehicle’s doors with the key fob will also shut down many factory car alarms. When standing close enough to the vehicle for your key fob to reach, press the lock button followed by the unlock button. Many car alarms will shut down when the car doors are unlocked by the keys or appropriate key fob. If the door locks do not respond, the batteries may be dead in the key fob. Replace the batteries and try again. If the doors unlock and the alarm continues to go off, your vehicle may need to be repaired by a professional.  Most key fobs have an orange or yellow button on them commonly referred to as a “panic button.” This button activates something very similar to a car alarm. The horn will honk and the lights will flash. If you accidentally hit the panic button, it may continue until you press the button again. In some cars, you may be able to shut down the panic mode by starting the car and driving it.Most panic alarms will shut off on their own after a certain amount of time. The panic alarm may not shut off when you start the car, but will if you begin to drive.  Your alarm is designed to prevent your vehicle from being stolen by someone without a key, so starting the car with the ignition key is often sufficient to power down your car alarm. Unlock the door and enter your vehicle. Insert the key and turn it to “ACC” (accessories). If the alarm persists, attempt to start the car. Remember that some aftermarket alarms may not allow you to start the car with the alarm sounding, even with the key.Turning the key in the ignition should reset the alarm, but that may not always be the case.  Standing next to a car with a blaring alarm may not strike you as the best time to do some light reading, but your vehicle’s owner’s manual can likely provide you with important information about shutting off your car alarm. If you are unable to shut the alarm off with your keys or key fob, check the owner’s manual for instructions on what to do.Every auto maker uses different car alarms, so some may require a specific action be taken before the alarm will shut down. You may need to repeat an action a certain number of times to reset the computer, such as locking and unlocking the door.	Use the key to lock and unlock the driver’s side door. Use the key fob to lock and unlock the door. Make sure you haven’t hit the panic button. Start the car. Read the owner’s manual.
There are arguments for both approaches -- two pipes are better than one in terms of flow capacity, but adding a second pipe may be a more-difficult plumbing job.  If using the existing pipe, you will need to cut it and install a check valve and T-connector. The check valve goes below the T-connector between the T and the existing sump pump. Make sure the flow direction for the check valve is correct! A second check valve will be installed between the side of the T-connector and the new bilge pump. If installing a new bilge pump outflow pipe, run that to the same place that your current sump outflow exits. For such a long run, you should use electrical ties to keep the pipe from sagging when full of water.; , The bilge pump secondary level control switch needs to be installed a few inches above the existing sump level control switch. There are many possibilities for mounting this switch. The main consideration is that the switch must be mounted so that nothing interferes with its operation and that it is solidly mounted., This will entail finishing the plumbing by either attaching the bilge pump to the anti-backflow valve or to the independent outflow pipe. (No backflow valve is required for the independent pipe approach.) , Make all connections above the water level. Use wire nuts and anti-oxidation compound for long-term reliability. Polarity is important for DC circuits! , If the sump pump runs but does not pump, you may have the polarity reversed., You should see at least a trickle-charge if not a several-amp charging current. Test the pump again with the charger and battery., Also, the bilge pump should work properly with no house power available.,	Determine whether you are going to use the existing outflow pipe for both pumps or add a second pipe for just the bilge pump. Know where it needs to be installed. Install the bilge pump in the sump. Connect the battery, fuse, control switch (optional), bilge level control switch, and bilge pump with heavy-duty wiring. Test the battery-only operation. Attach the charger to the battery and plug in the charger. Final testing should include making sure the original sump pump and the new bilge pump sequence properly and work simultaneously.Make sure all connections are taped and all wires are tied or taped and you should be done.Make sure the charger is set to automatic mode (it will maintain the battery normally but switch to charge mode if there is a draw on the battery or it is discharged after an outage).
Turn on all faucets to see which ones are working. If water is running through one faucet but not another, the problem is located along the pipes running between the two. Leave all faucets open slightly. A small trickle of running water from working faucets can prevent further freezing and help melt the ice. Leave blocked faucets open as well to reduce pressure on the pipes.   Most American houses have faucets on external walls too, especially on the front and back of the house.; , If a large area of your house has no water, look in the most likely and accessible areas first before you start tearing apart walls. Use the steps below to focus on these areas, unless you managed to narrow down the search to a smaller portion of your house:   Pipes in or near uninsulated crawlspaces, attics, or basements. Pipes near cold air vents or cold concrete. Outdoor valves and spigots. Outdoor pipes can freeze, but check these last, as most systems are designed to keep standing water out of these pipes.  Examine the pipes in the affected area carefully. Freezing water can cause pipes to crack from the change in pressure, usually splitting the pipe lengthwise or causing cracks in the joints.   To look at the backs of pipes near walls, and in other difficult to reach areas, use a flashlight and a large dental mirror from a hardware store. If you find a leak, close the main shut-off valve immediately. Call a plumber to replace the pipe, or fix it yourself if you are up to the task.  Assuming there are no leaks or cracks, find the section of the pipe with frozen water using one of the following methods.   Feel the temperature of the pipe with your hand, or use an infrared thermometer to locate areas significantly colder than other pipes. Tap the pipe with a screwdriver handle or other object, listening for a more solid, less "hollow" sound. If you rule out all exposed pipes in the affected area, skip to the section on unfreezing pipes inside walls.  Open the faucet attached to the frozen pipe, and open nearby working faucets to a trickle. Running water is much less likely to freeze than standing water. If the running water passes through or near a frozen area, it may even help thaw the ice over the course of an hour or two.   If you see any cracks in any pipe, turn off the main water supply to your house immediately, and close all faucets.  Turn on a hair dryer and run it back and forth along the frozen pipe. Keep it moving and do not place the dryer directly against the pipe, as uneven or sudden heating can rupture the pipe. If your pipes are metal, you can use a more powerful heat gun in the same fashion.   PVC pipes can be damaged at temperatures as low as 140ºF (60ºC). Never use a heat gun or other direct heat stronger than a hair dryer. Outdoor valves often have fiber washers or other non-heat-safe materials inside them. Heat them slowly and cautiously.  Purchase electrical heat tape from a hardware store. Wrap the tape in a single layer around the length of the frozen pipe, then plug it into a power source. The tape consists of heating elements that warm up when turned on.   Do not overlap electrical heat tape. Wrap it around the pipe only once or in a spiral pattern.  Position space heaters, bare incandescent light bulbs, or heat lamps in the room with the frozen pipe, near the pipe but not touching it. Hang up tarps or blankets to trap the heat in a smaller area, but don't let them come into direct contact with the heat source. For large rooms, use several heat sources to ensure safe, even heating of the pipe.  Salt lowers the melting point of ice, causing it to melt at colder temperatures. Pour a tablespoon (15 mL) of salt down the drain, and give it time to act on the ice.   You can try dissolving the salt in 1/2 cup (120 mL) boiling water first, but this risks bursting the pipe with a sudden temperature change., Put on rubber gloves, and soak towels in hot water. Ring them out, then wrap them securely around the frozen section of pipe. Replace with freshly soaked, hot towels every 5–10 minutes until the pipe thaws.   Do not leave cold wet towels around the pipes.  If you can find an external vent, put down a fan heater blowing warm air into the vent. Use a cardboard box or tarp to minimize the amount of heat lost to the surrounding air.  Crank the heat in the house to around 75 to 80ºF (24–27ºC) and wait two to three hours.   Open closet and cabinet doors so the warm air circulates as close to the walls as possible.  Unfortunately, this is often necessary to reach a frozen pipe before it bursts. Follow the instructions in the locating pipes section to isolate the most likely area of the problem. Use a keyhole saw to cut a hole into this area, then use any of the methods in the section on unfreezing pipes.   If this is a recurring problem, consider installing a cabinet door over the hole instead of fully repairing the wall, for ease of access next time this occurs.  Keep pipes in cold areas wrapped with "pipe sponge" covers, rags, or other insulating material. If an electrical outlet is nearby, you can keep them wrapped with electrical heat tape, unplugged, then plug the tape in whenever cold weather arrives.  Check your crawlspaces and external walls for holes, and repair them to minimize exposure to cold air. Use wind barriers or faucet covers to protect faucets and valves on the exterior of the house.  During cold weather, turn on a 60 watt incandescent light bulb near the area of pipe that previously froze, or just below it. If used to warm crawl spaces and other unsupervised areas, make sure there are no flammable materials kept in the same space.  It is much more difficult for pipes to freeze if water is running through them, since the water will usually travel through the pipe before it has time to freeze. During sub-freezing weather, keep faucets slightly open to allow a trickle of water.   You can adjust the ballast in your toilet tank to keep it running even when the tank is full.	Narrow down the search. Look in the most likely areas. Search for cracks and leaks. Find the frozen area. Leave faucets slightly open. Use a hair dryer or heat gun. Apply heat tape. Heat the surrounding air. Add salt to frozen drains. Wrap the pipe in hot towels. Blow a fan heater into outdoor vents. Turn up the central heating. Cut a hole in the wall. Insulate the pipes. Protect the pipes from wind and cold air. Heat the area. Leave a trickle of water running.
Make a medallion necklace similar to what might be worn at a Native American powwow by using seed beads and felt. Bead designs into a circular piece of felt, and attach that to a leather or faux leather cord.   You can create any design you want on the medallion with different colored seed beads. To sew on beads securely, use nylon beading thread to pick up four beads, stitch through your foundation material, then loop back through the last two beads before picking up four new ones.Use a sharp needle that can go through the felt for your medallion but still thin enough to fit through your beads. You can use larger beads, or a thinner foundation material and attach it to felt later, if you’re having trouble with this.  Put a stone on display by stringing it on a cord to wear as a necklace. Use turquoise, coral, or other precious or semiprecious stones commonly found in Native American jewelry.   Try using a natural material for the cord such as leather or suede, or an imitation version of these. Look for a stone in a jewelry store that has a pre-drilled hole or a jump ring to run a cord through. If you can’t find this, you can try wrapping a stone in thin, flexible wire in order to attach it to a cord for your necklace., Attach one or more feathers to the bottom of any pendant or medallion for a natural touch. You can also feature feathers exclusively in your necklace by wrapping the feather quills with cord.   Use natural feathers rather than ones that have been artificially dyed. You can also thread beads onto the quill of a feather for decoration and to help attach it to the cord or chain of a necklace. Push a bead onto the quill, then thread a headpin (flexible pin with a flat end) through the bead in the opposite direction. Then bend the headpin around a jump ring or your cord to attach it.	Create a beaded medallion. Make a simple stone pendant. Utilize feathers in a necklace.
You want the soil to be loose and light when sowing your sunflower seeds. If your soil is low in nutrients or drains poorly, mix in three to four inches of compost.  You can simply use your hands to dig these small holes. If planting in rows, make sure to allow about 30 inches (76.2 cm) of soil between each row. Sunflowers need a lot of space to grow healthily.   For large sunflower types, allow 18 inches (45.7 cm) of space between seeds. For medium-sized sunflower types, allow 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between seeds.  You can stagger your planting over a few weeks in order to experience blooms at different times throughout the summer. Since sunflowers are annuals, meaning they flower once per year, staggering your seeds will allow you to enjoy blooms over a longer period of time.  Choose an organic fertilizer when possible and spread it over the seeding area to promote strong stalks.  Make sure you wet the soil, but do not drench or flood the seeds.	Loosen the soil using your hands or a hand trowel. Dig one-inch deep holes, spaced six to 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart, depending on the varietal size. Place a few seeds in each hole and cover with soil. Mix a thin layer of fertilizer after planting the seeds. Water thoroughly after planting and fertilizing.
There are a few major things to do before handing over the keys of your car to a vehicle transport company. Thus, it is good to create a checklist first and then move down every step, especially when you are moving your car across the country.; , Since you will be moving your car across the country you will need a shipping company that can deliver nationwide. It is a good idea to choose a company that is both a carrier and a broker. As a carrier the company has trucks traveling certain roads all the time which often means a quicker delivery of your vehicle across the country. If they don't serve the route you need, then they will find a carrier from their network to pick up your vehicle.  Research and contact a few companies. Ask them questions regarding their services and rates. Obtain quotes from all of them. Compare the services they offer and the prices they are asking you to pay. If there is a big difference in some rates, consider this a red flag. Car shipping rates are affected by many variables and they can fluctuate often, yet they should be close when it is for the same vehicle and route. Rates vary based on gas prices, miles, make and model of the vehicle, modifications to the vehicle and seasonal changes.  Make sure you are safe when you are transporting your car across the country. Verify the company's licenses, ratings and insurance policy. Check their USDOT number and BBB rating. It is a good practice to also read reviews of what other customers are saying about the company policies and practices. This is the best way to make sure the company you have chosen is going to deliver what they have promised, and most importantly your car in the same condition it was picked up.  It is important to have your car's interior and exterior cleaned before pick up to make the inspection easier. The truckers always inspect a car before loading it onto the trailer and mark down any scratches and damages your car has. You should also go over the inspection with the trucker. This way you will be sure that everything is marked correctly when you sign the Bill of Lading and the inspection report. Preparing your car for shipping across the country also means removing any loose parts such as ski and bike racks, rear spoilers, spare tire and all other covers and modifications you can remove.	Create a checklist. Search for car transport companies. Contact a few car shipping companies. Choose a company and verify its legitimacy. Prepare your car for shipping.
Some pruning is done for the health of the tree, but most pruning is done for the sake of appearance. You can remove dead, dying, or diseased wood from the tree regardless of its age. The removal of awkward or unappealing branches should be held back until the Japanese maple has a chance to grow into its natural shape, which usually does not happen until it reaches two to three years of age.; , Technically, the only time of year when you cannot prune a Japanese maple is spring, since sap is developing during this time. Late summer and winter are the most favorable times, though.During winter, you can clearly see the branches and will be able to tell which ones interfere with the overall structure of the tree. In summer, you can get a better idea for how the tree will look with certain branches removed. Pruning in the summer also stimulates less new growth, which can help prevent the tree from growing out of control.  There are two main types of Japanese maple tree: upright and lace leaf.Upright Japanese maple trees have branches that point upward, as most trees do. The branches should resemble opened fans. Weeping or laceleaf Japanese maple trees have branches that grow upward, to the sides, and downward. The top layer of the tree should create a veil or canopy over the rest of the tree.  The first, most important thing to prune away are the diseased, dying, or dead stems growing on the tree. Deadwood appears most often on the inside bottom of the tree, where excess shade has caused the wood to rot. Dying or diseased wood can rot further, spreading disease to the rest of your otherwise healthy tree.  Branches that overlap one another usually wreck the silhouette of the tree. Even if they do not, the two branches could eventually end up interfering with one another’s growth. Remove one or both of the overlapping branches, sawing them off at the base, nearest the trunk, rather than merely cutting them away where they start to overlap.  Branches that hand down into the area occupied by another branch or branches that are too close to each other can make the tree’s foliage look clumpy. The goal is to make the Japanese maple tree look evenly thinned out. You can either prune or saw off the weaker of the two branches, or you can determine which branch is less important to the tree’s outline and remove that one.  For an upright tree, a top branch that grows downward would be a good example. For a weeping or laceleaf Japanese maple, a common example would be a lower branch extending straight and upward. Saw the offending limb off at its base.   Note that many lace leaf version have twisted, curved branches that should not look straight. As long as these branches are not interfering with other branches, they should be kept.  These trees have "opposite buds" or "opposite branches," meaning that the smallest branches grow out of the larger branches two at a time. The resulting branch looks like a "Y" with an extra branch coming out from the center. Remove this center branch so that the branches look like a normal "Y." Cut as close to the point of intersection as possible, leaving as little of the center stem as possible., For upright varieties, the lower lateral branches can make it difficult to walk under the tree or may conflict with plants growing beneath it. For laceleaf varieties, you should expect branches to hang low. Branches that drag on the ground hang too low, though, and can be removed for the sake of appearance.  When you see buds developing, you can manage them to direct the eventual growth of the tree. Buds point in the direction that the tree will grow in, and many buds grow into dominant branches. If a bud is placed in a location that you believe will be inconvenient, you can pluck it out by hand to redirect the tree's growth in a different direction.  Light pruning is the best way to manage this because it limits regrowth, preventing excessive growth from forming on one side but not on another.   Another important part of keeping a balanced form is by avoiding dramatic diameter differences. If you prune a thick branch back to a small side branch, the shape of that section will look unbalanced and out of proportion.  Never remove a limb with a diameter that is more than half the size of the tree’s trunk. For older trees, you should consider keeping any limb with a diameter that is more than 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the tree trunk’s diameter., Removing too much of the tree's growth can stimulate excessive growth or cause unnecessary stress to the Japanese maple. You should also avoid removing more than 1/4 of the foliage on any given branch. Otherwise, the branch may not be able to absorb enough nutrients.	Use pruning to shape mature trees. Prune in the summer or winter. Know how the branches of your Japanese maple should look. Remove dead wood. Cut away branches that cross or intertwine. Saw off weak branches that could interfere with strong branches. Remove branches growing in the wrong direction. Use a selective heading cut. Remove lower branches, if desired. Snip away buds to direct branch growth. Keep things balanced. Leave the largest limbs intact. Never remove more than 1/5 of the tree’s crown.
Look for pine cones that can sit up on their own without props. Avoid using any that seem too heavy or too skinny.   Test each pine cone by seeing if it can stand on its own and looks symmetrical.;	Gather pine cones from your yard or the park.
Does your dresser need to be stripped and re-painted or stained? Or can you simply change out drawer pulls and add numbers?; , If the piece is falling over and has weak legs, you may want to think about retiring it forever. However, if the basic bones are in good shape it may be a piece you can salvage.   Have an expert evaluate the piece if you are working with an antique or a family heirloom. Something this valuable may not be a good idea for a novice furniture restoration artist so call in the pros instead.	Consider what type of update the dresser requires. Determine if furniture is in workable order.
; , Do this by counting the beats in the bar. Most songs are written in 4/4(you can count to four in a musical bar), or 3/4 (three beats).  It is not very important to have the exact chord(E9 instead of E11 for instance), as long as you know the tonic (or main chord tone). This tends to be the lowest note in the chord, and the chord is named after that tone. For example, the tonic of an E Major Chord is E. ,, If you don't play drums yourself or don't have recording options nearby, use a drum machine (you may find free software on the internet which imitates a drum machine). Either you can use pre-programmed beats, which often works very well, or program it yourself. Most songs favor drum patterns which have the bass drum hitting on beats one and three, snare drum on beats two and four, and hi-hat or ride cymbal on all four beats, often doubling the hits for more rock-influenced music.  Do this by using either a bass guitar or a keyboard on the darker half of the keys. If you want it simple, the best approach would be to let the bass play the tonic of the chord, if you like to spice things up, you can use notes from whatever chord being played at that beat. The rhythm of the bass is crucial, beyond telling people what chords they are listening to, the bass usually plays together with the drums to establish the groove. A simple way is to let bass play at the same beats as the bass drum. Another is just playing 8th notes(two notes per beat) for å more driving groove.  Find out how the rhythm section of the song should affect the grove and feel. By using dynamics and spicy notes, one can create songs that have depth of dimension just by adding very basic elements.	Get a pencil and a sheet of paper. Find the song's time signature. Find out which chords that is used.Write down all the beats in each section, and mark each bar (that would be four beats in 4/4)  , Write down the chords on the beat they are being played.  , Add Drums. Add Bass. Arrange.

Good choices include pelargonium (scented geranium), lavender, pansies, mint, thyme, lemon balm, mint, rosemary, bay leaves, violets, etc. When picking them, ensure that you keep a little stem on each one to help keep its place in the tussie mussie.; , Arrange the various herbs in a circular way around the flower. Try to maintain each herb at an even level with each other herb. Let the stems stick out downwards to form one stem or holding point.   If wished, arrange the leaves and flowers on a foil doily to help create the circular shape and keep everything in place. If doing this, make a small hole in the middle of the doily to allow the stems to poke through.  At this point, decide whether you'd like to add another layer of herbs to build up the tussie mussie. If so, add the layer and tie again with another rubber band.  This completes the tussie mussie, although it's a good idea to trim the stems to ensure that the base is even.	Select your favourite herbs and flowers. Place the flower or flowers in the centre of the arrangement. Use a rubber band to tie everything together at the top of the stems. Tie a ribbon bow around the stem.
Make sure to get as much supervised practice as you can. Commit to driving with an experienced driver before and after you get your driver’s license until you are comfortable driving by yourself. This way, you will have enough experience to drive safely on your own., Do this once you are comfortable driving during good weather conditions. Train for bad weather conditions by driving with an experienced driver while it is raining, snowing, foggy, or during other poor weather conditions.In general, avoid driving in extreme weather conditions whether you are an experienced driver or not.  The risk of getting into an accident or collision is three times higher during the night. Therefore, try to limit your night driving and avoid driving after midnight. In general, avoid driving at night until you are comfortable driving during the day.	Practice, practice, practice. Train for bad weather conditions. Limit driving at night.
Piggy back your tunes (use BINGO and Mary Had a Little Lamb, etc) and make up the words to suit every day activities. Put the spelling of their names to music and make it such a part of their lives that they cannot think without music being in their heads. If you play an instrument well, play it for them... often. Their brains can be "fine tuned" to (correctly) hear the music from a very young age.; , They will find that performing is fun. Most musical theater groups will perform in a low key and non-threatening way. A hardy round of applause will culminate in a desire to do more and to do better each time.  Get a voice coach that knows how to work with children.   At some point you are going to want them to join a children chorus. There is probably one in their school, so encourage them to join.  This will help your child understand music more, and make it easier for them to excel in singing lessons.  the radio, music in TV, and maybe some good tapes/CDs they might enjoy. A good idea is to put some classical music on their bedside when they go to sleep. Not so loud as they cannot sleep, but at a level in which they an still listen.  while doing chores, cooking meals, in the car to the radio etc. Sing songs your child knows and encourage them to join in.  This could include open mic nights, karaoke, talent shows, Etc. Before you do this however, watch talent shows on TV and see if your child shows an interest in that area. If so, then you can start taking them to different events  , Your manager will look for jobs that are available, make deals, and other such things.	Sing to them, all of the time, from when they are infants, to toddler age and higher. Involve them in musical theater classes at school or as an extra curricular activity. Invest in singing lessons, this will help improve your child's voice. Teach your child basic music theory (or get tutoring). Surround your child with music e.g. Be a good role model: Sing around the house i.e. As your child progresses and gets better, start exposing them to the public, even if they don't participate for the first few times. If you really want to get serious and want your child to have a career in singing, then get a manager.
Try large bark chips, osmunda fiber, large-size calcine clay, or tree fern fiber. Add small amounts of peat moss or vermiculite to hold water.; , There are various ways to obtain a young plant.   Cut or break off young side shoots or "pups" from an existing plant when they're half the size of the adult. Cut a dwarf pineapple fruit, leaving a little bit of the fruit attached to the topknot. Divide the "ratoons" (root parts) of mature plants.  Bromeliads in general prosper in the east, south, or west window where they can get 3 to 4 hours of full sun every day. Overall, dwarf pineapples require bright, warm conditions.  There's no need to water the growing medium because overflow from the cup is enough to do the trick. , If you don't harvest the pineapple, it will likely bloom into a flower.	Compose a loose, well-drained growing medium. Plant the dwarf pineapple in a pot with the growing medium. Put the plant in an indoor area where it will receive partial to full sunlight. Water the plant once a week by filling the cup or basin formed by the base of the leaves. Fertilize every 6-8 weeks with half-strength organic fertilizer during watering.  , Harvest the dwarf pineapples and then replant the top. Finished.
The type of yarn and hook you use for this border does not matter, but they need to match. To figure out what hook you need, buy your yarn first. Look at the label, and find the image with the crochet hook on it. It will tell you what size hook you need.  This triple picot has two small loops and one big one. It's composed of 3 chains, 5 chains, and then 3 chains, all in the same stitch., Slip your crochet hook through both loops of your first stitch. Make three chain stitches., Slip your hook through both loops of the first stitch. Make a slip stitch. This closes the chain, forming a loop., This will eventually form the middle picot, which will be a little bigger than the rest., Slip your hook through both loops of the first stitch. Make a slip stitch to close the chain. You should now have 2 picots in the same stitch., Crochet 3 chain stitches, then close the chain with a slip stitch in the first stitch., This will create the space between the triple picots and prevent them from bumping up against each other., Count 4 stitches from your picot. Make a slip stitch in the fifth stitch. This secures the chain to the border., Keep repeating the previous steps for the rest of the border.	Choose your yarn and hook. Chain 3 in the first stitch. Close the chain with a slip stitch. Chain 5 in the first stitch. Close the chain with a slip stitch. Make your final picot in the same stitch. Crochet three chain stitches for the gap. Skip 4 stitches, then make a slip stitch. Make your second triple picot.
There are lots of ways to interpret a beach theme, including nautical, rustic, and tropical. Each one will have its own set of colors, plants, and decorative elements. Choose one that appeals the most to you.; , Most beach themes will be bright and colorful, but if you are going with a nautical theme, you might want to use a limited color palette instead. A tropical theme might include lots of bright colors, while a rustic theme might use softer ones.  You can create a beach-themed garden just about anywhere—including in containers on a balcony and patio. The larger garden you have, the more options you will have. If you don't have a lot of space, however, you may not be able to plant some of the larger plants, such as palms.  Not all types of plants work for a beach-themed garden. At the same time, not all plants will be well-suited to the area that you live in. You will need to find a balance between the two by first finding beachy plants, and then selecting the ones that will flourish in your area.  Like all living things, plants require care. They need water, fertilizer, and pruning. Some plants, such as succulents, require a lot less care than others. If you don't have a lot of time to spare, consider selecting some low-maintenance plants for your garden.  This will help reign in some of your ideas, and may help you decide between two different plants, pebbles, and decor. If you live close to a beach, you might even be able to scavenge some rocks, shells, and driftwood, saving yourself some material costs.   Instead of buying expensive decorations, consider making your own!  , Plants found along beaches have to survive harsh conditions, with varying temperatures, strong winds, and salty air. They have to be drought-tolerant as well.Great beachy plants include:Beach strawberry Common thrift Gold coin Saffron buckwheat Seaside daisy  , Great coastal trees include coast banksia and eucalyptus. They act as natural buffers for smaller plants on real beaches, and can make your beach garden look more beach-like.Small palm trees, such as Mexican fan palms, are a great option for tropical beach-themed gardens and side gardens., Examples of bushy shrubs include: coastal rosemary, diosma, and woolly bush.Plant taller bushes towards the back of your plant bed. Use smaller bushes near the front as groundcovers and borders.  Not only are they beach-like, but they are also very hardy and don't require a lot of care. Great succulents include: agave, blue chalk sticks, and pigface (also called "ice plant").Plant different types of succulents together in batches for a variety of color and texture.  Skip the green, bushy lawns, and pick out some scruffy, drought-tolerant grasses instead.Great coastal grasses include: coast tussock grass, fountain grass, and orange sedge., Not only will this be more aesthetically pleasing, but it will also look more natural. Many coastal plants like to grow close together for protection against the coast's harsh winds and climate., After you have planted your flowers in their preferred soil, top it off with a layer of sand. You could also consider a crushed seashell blend or granitic sand instead., You can scatter these about randomly, or use them as borders for your garden.You could even use large shells (real or cement) as planters for small to medium-sized plants. Sea urchins make great planters for succulents and air plants.  Beautiful and organic, no two pieces are alike. You can make these special features in plant beds, or you can display them on your patio table instead.If you have any driftwood planks, you can use these as stepping stones to mimic paths found in beaches.  Add a hint of rustic by using twine to hang up baskets and planters. Wrap twine around mason jars or candle votives. Add a rustic touch to wooden furniture by winding twine around the joints to make them look as through they are handmade.   If you have a lot of sea shells at home, drill some holes into them, then string them onto a piece of twine to make a garland. Hang the garland on a wall or in a window., Brainstorm some items that might be found at a beach, and incorporate them into your garden. Things like surfboards, life savers, wooden oars, and ship wheels are all good bets. Clear, glass gazing orbs (not the mirrored king) would also work well because they mimic sea glass.  Another option is to use a synthetic wood made from recycled materials.Not only is this more environmentally friendly, but it also lasts longer.  You can also use white or unpainted wood furniture, and then add color with bright tablecloths, pillows, and cushions. , These do especially well in front yards.You can also put one in your backyard instead, however. When filling it, consider white pebbles, or glass—be sure to use the type meant for fire pits, however!  , If you want something more tropical, consider getting an awning made from straw or palm leaves instead. This would work great paired with a hammock and some tiki torches.  Candles are a great option for just about any garden, but you can also install other lighting features as well. For example:   If your have a tropical beach garden, consider getting some tiki torches. If you have a rustic garden, consider getting some mason jar lanterns instead.	Decide on a general theme. Choose a color scheme. Consider how much space you have. Consider the climate that you live in. Decide how much time and effort you are willing to commit. Have a budget. Focus on drought-tolerant plants, even if you live in a wet area. Consider getting a tree or two. Get some bushy shrubs to use as fillers. Make use of succulents. Plant grasses alongside succulents. Group your plants together. Fill plant beds with sand. Use sea shells, sea glass, and pebbles. Decorate with driftwood, sandstone, and other natural elements. Use twine as trim. Add other beach-themed decor items. Use wood for furniture and decking. Use bright, bold, solid colors.If you can't find furniture in the right color, you can easily paint it using outdoor-quality paint. Add some beach chairs or a hammock.For a more traditional look, use unpainted, wooden Adirondack chairs.For something more relaxed and tropical, consider a macramé hammock.  , Consider adding a fire pit. Add some shade with an umbrella. Don't forget the lighting!
Before you start building Guy Manuel's helmet you will want to measure your head. This will allow you to know what sizes your components will be and will ensure your mask fits. Measure your head carefully to avoid problems, allowing you to wear it comfortably once the mask is finished. There are a few measurements that you will need to take in order to get you started.Measure the circumference of your head. Use a cloth tape measure, looping it around the area of your head where a hat would rest, to get your head's circumference. Measure the length between the tip of your nose to the back of your head. You can use a standard ruler for this. Take a measurement between the top of your shoulder ridge and the top of your head. Use a standard ruler to measure the width of your head. This should be the distance between your temples. Record your measurements and use them to properly size the pieces of your helmet.  Before you can get started building your Daft Punk helmet you will need to gather your materials. It's important that you gather all the materials from the following list as you will be making use of all of them:Metallic gold spray paint and gold vinyl sheets. Clear acrylic globe. Heat gun. Something to cut with. Battery powered rainbow Christmas lights. LED belt buckle or name-tag Plastic lids. For example, you can use a lid from a peanut butter jar. Card stock or foam to build the sides of the mask. Wood glue to make the craft foam sturdy. Hot glue to hold things together. 1/16” aluminum flat bar for the mask's frame. Speaker wires. Dark smoke headlight tint-spray.  The acrylic globe will be used to create the visor of your mask. You will need to cut the globe to a certain shape and then bend it using a heat gun. This will create the proper shape and curvature of this Daft Punk mask visor.Cut off the sides of the globe to get an 8” mask visor. Stretch this piece using a heat gun so that it matches the shape of Guy's mask. Spray your visor with black car window tint-spray.  Cut out some strips of aluminum that will be used to build a basic frame for your mask. The frame won't be visible when the mask is finished. The frame is used to to hold things together while you work to build the rest of mask. You will only need two strips of aluminum to build your frame.Cut one strip for the bottom front of the frame. Cut another strip for the top and sides of the frame. Hold the frame together with glue. Attach your visor to the frame with glue. Make sure the measurements of this frame will fit the proportions of your head. The frame will be the main part that needs to fit your head.  To build the sides of the mask you will be cutting out layers of either foam or card-stock. These layers will form the shape of the mask as well as add support and strength to the mask's structure. Take your time and cut out shapes that closely match the shape of the original helmet, gluing them together to build the sides of the mask.Cutting out the mask sides from foam can be a quick way to build the mask sides. You can try layering card-stock to build the sides of the mask to the shape you want. Once you have built the sides of your mask you can attach them to the frame using glue. Add the circular jar lids to the sides of the mask to make the “ears”.  Now that your mask is assembled you can begin to add the metallic gold color to it. You will first need to spray paint the mask before applying the metallic gold vinyl sheets.Block off your mask's visor with painter's tape to prevent the gold paint from getting on it. Spray the mask with the gold metallic paint first. Make sure you've covered it completely. Once painted, apply the gold vinyl to finish the metallic look.  The lights will be added to the inside of the mask, using tape so that you can adjust them or remove them later on. You will need to add both the side lights and the front bottom “word” LED light. Keep the following tips in mind when creating your mask's lights:Rainbow Christmas lights can work for the sides. Place the lights in a column with their noses touching and hold this strip together with a tape backing. An LED belt buckle or nametag can be used for the “word” light that will go near the mouth of your mask. Attach the lights to the inside of your mask using tape or magnets. Make sure your lights are all battery powered.  Guy's mask has a bundle of wires that are visible at the back. Adding these wires will be the finishing touch on your own mask. These wires should be cut to a length that covers the back portion of the mask and can be attached using hot glue or other adhesive.These wires should lay flat against the mask. Make sure none of the wires are overlapping each other. Try to find wires that have a colorful outer coating.	Measure your head. Gather your materials. Cut and mold the acrylic globe. Build a simple aluminum frame. Build the sides of the mask. Color the mask gold. Add the lights. Add the wires.
In applicable situations, the first thing you should do for fires involving flammable liquids is to turn the fuel supply off.For instance, if a static discharge ignites gasoline around a fuel pump, the first thing you should do is hit the emergency shutoff valve located nearby at all pumping stations. This act severs the small fire from the very large fuel sources around it.   In many instances where the flammable liquid is the only fuel source, the fire may extinguish itself as soon as you cut the fuel supply.  You can also use a fire blanket on small Class B fires. If a fire blanket is readily available, this can be the easiest, least damaging method to extinguish it.   To use a fire blanket, remove from its packing, grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it, and drape the blanket over the small fire. Do NOT throw the blanket at the fire. Ensure the fire is not too large for the blanket to smother it. Vegetable oil igniting in a frying pan, for instance, is a small enough fire for a fire blanket.  As with electrical fires, water-based (Class A) fire extinguishers should not be used on liquid or oil fires. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and dry chemical fire extinguishers will have a Class B rating.Check the label on the extinguisher and ensure that it says Class B before using it on a flammable liquid fire.   To use the extinguisher, pull any pin stopping you from depressing the handle, point the horn at the base of the fire, and hold down the handle.As you see the flames shrinking, approach the source and continue spraying until the fire is fully extinguished.If you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher, then it’s too large.Evacuate to a safe place and call 911. The only exception to this rule when the liquid fire stems from vegetable oil or animal fats in commercial-size deep fryers and other restaurant equipment. The large size and extreme heat and fuel source of these devices get their own classification for fire extinguishers—Class K extinguishers.Restaurants with this type of equipment are legally required to keep a Class K extinguisher present.Do NOT throw water on liquid or oil fires. Water does not mix with the oil. When they are together, the oil stays on top of the water. The water will then boil and become steam 'very quickly.’ This quick boil is dangerous. Since the water is on the bottom of the oil, it sprays hot, burning oil in every direction as it boils off and evaporates. This then spreads the fire very quickly.  Even if the fire is out, you should still call 911.Smoldering objects can reignite, and proper firefighters will be able to isolate and remove any risks completely.	Shut off the fuel supply. Use a fire blanket to smother the fire. Use a Class B fire extinguisher. Call 911.
Remember to slip the first stitch of each row as if to purl and your decreases only happen on the right side (RS) of the work. Here's how:  Row 1: Loosely cast on 16 stitches, place marker, cast on a further 16 stitches (32 stitches in total). Row 2: Knit on the wrong side (WS). Row 3: Decrease row. Knit until you are 2 stitches before the marker. Knit the next two stitches together through the back of the loop and then knit to the end of the row (RS). Row 4: Knit WS. Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you are left with just 2 stitches on the needle (WS), pass the left stitch over the right stitch so you have just one stitch left and then fasten off.; , If you are not a fan of sewing squares together though, try picking up stitches.  Look at your square as a diamond with the top point being where you finished knitting and fastened off. You can add a square (actually a diamond) to the right and left sides, and then add a diamond between those two diamonds. This photo should help:        When starting diamonds that are on the right side of the blanket (like the green one), loosely cast on the first 16 stitches using the long tail cast on. Then place marker and pick up 16 stitches alongside of diamond to the left of the new one. For diamonds that are on the left edge of the blanket, pick up 16 stitches in the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, then loosely cast on 16 stitches using the cable cast on. For diamonds that are not on the edges, pick up 16 stitches from the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, pick up center stitch from the tip of the diamond below, pick up 15 stitches on the side of the diamond to the left. Rotate your work and you will end up with a nice square or rectangular blanket. , Perhaps a crochet edge would be nice.	Learn to make a mitered square. Sew each of your squares together any way you like.Continue until your blanket is finished. Add some decorative edging if you like.
While it may seem too obvious, the title is the first step in determining if this is a crochet pattern you want to try. The title will let you know if the pattern is for a scarf, a blanket or some other item. Sometimes, the title may also offer you clues to the difficulty of the pattern.; , Examine the pattern to determine if it is designed for beginner, intermediate or advanced-level crocheters. The difficulty is usually listed under the title. There is no reason to read through a pattern that is advanced if you are just beginning to learn to crochet.  Look to see what the finished measurements of the project will be. If it is a pattern for some type of wearable garment, the sizes that are available from this pattern will be listed.  Your pattern will tell you what type of yarn can be used and what the weight of the yarn should be. It will also tell you how much yarn you will need to complete the project. The crochet pattern will even tell you what size crochet hook to buy and if there are any other materials you will need to complete the project.  Gauge refers to amount of crocheted fabric that a specific hook size and yarn type will create. While the gauge is less important if you have an unending supply of yarn and aren't worried about the size of your completed project, most of the time you need to be aware of the size of your crochet stitches.   To check your gauge, crochet a swatch approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) by 4 inches in the stitch pattern listed in the crochet instructions.If your gauge is larger than the gauge indicated in the pattern, try a smaller hook. If your gauge is smaller, try a larger hook.  You can look for tutorials on the Internet for any stitches you may be unfamiliar with. The basic stitch types include:chain slip stich single crochet half double crochet double crochet triple crochet  , Some crochet patterns list a key with abbreviations and their terms.Some patterns assume that you know what the abbreviations stand for. Some of the most common abbreviations include:ch=chain sl st=slip stitch sc=single crochet hdc=half double crochet dc=double crochet tc=triple crochet inc=increase dec=decrease  turn=turn your project over and start crocheting in the opposite direction join=connect two stitches together rep=repeat, It is common to encounter asterisks (*) in crochet patterns, so you need to know what they mean. Asterisks indicate that the steps provided need to be repeated in order until you reach the end of the row.For example, if you encounter instructions for a row that read: “Hdc in next 6 sts; *dc 2, sl st, dc in next st; rep from * to end,” then you will know that the instructions that follow the asterisk need to be repeated in order until you get to the end of the row.  Regardless what pattern you are crocheting, the first step is to make a slip knot on your hook. The pattern likely doesn't tell you to start with a slip knot, it's assumed you already know where to begin.Make a loop with the end of the yarn, and slip the loop onto the crochet hook. Wrap the yarn back over the crochet hook, and once again pull the yarn through the loop.Pull your crochet hook up with one hand while holding the other two ends of yarn to tie the slipknot tight.  The steps will begin by telling you how many chains to make.Then, the steps will be listed in order by number of rows or rounds. You will crochet Row 1 followed by Row 2, Row 3 and so on. Keep crocheting rows or rounds until you complete the project.   All crochet patterns begin with a foundation chain. The foundation chain could be long, as for an afghan, or short, as for a motif that begins as a circle.A pattern may be worked in rows back and forth to form a flat piece such as an afghan, or in rounds worked around to form a tube with no seams, such as in a hat.If the pattern directs you to turn the piece, flip it over so you are working from the opposite end. For example, you might keep the top side in the same position and switch the left end with the right end, flipping the top over., This number lets you know how many stitches you should be crocheting. You may need to add or drop a stitch to get back on track with the pattern.   It is a good idea to count your stitches once every 10 rows or so, just to make sure that you are on track with the pattern.  To stay on track with a pattern, it is important to keep track of the row that you are on by using a row counter, an app, or writing down your current row on a piece of paper.   Row counters fit right on the end of your hook and you will just need to click it forward each time you complete a row. Apps are available to help you keep track of your rows as well. To keep track of your rows using an app, you will need to tap the screen every time you finish a row. Pen and paper also work well for keeping track of your rows. You can simply write down your row number on the paper after you finish each row.  As you get ready to complete your project, check the finishing steps provided in your pattern to determine if the project needs to be sewn together or blocked. The finishing steps will often advise you about how to add accessories as well, such as buttons or ribbon.	Read the title of the crochet pattern. Check the pattern's difficulty. Determine the size of the finished project. Review the list of materials. Check your gauge. Identify any special terms or stitches that are used by this pattern.These are usually listed before the actual pattern begins. Interpret all the abbreviations that are given in the pattern. Repeat steps when you encounter an asterisk. Begin by tying a slip knot. Follow the steps of the pattern. Notice the number of stitches given at the end of the rows or rounds. Keep track of your rows. Refer to the finishing steps at the end of the pattern.
Note how it moves in and out of the pulley wheels, if there are any. Chains wrap around the derailleur (shifting device in the back of the bike) in a particular, but not difficulty to understand, patter you'll need to replicate later. Some chains are simply threaded on the gear.   If you work carefully you won't even need to remove the chain from the bike. But, depending where the link broke, there is a chance it slips off while cleaning or fixing. Take a quick picture now.; , The broken chain won't move, but the bike will be in soft, easy gears when you get it back on, as the extreme gears are the ones that tend to cause the chain to snap if it is weak.   If you only have one set of gears on this bike, you'll need a new chain link to proceed. The following method shortens the chain by a link, meaning it likely won't fit on your gears when finished., Use a toothbrush to get into the chainlinks, scrubbing off grime, rust, and dirt. A dirty chain is under much more stress than a clean one, and is much more primed to break. Clean it so that the chain links can move freely in your hands, paying attention specifically to any "stuck" or slow moving links. Clean the chain now to prevent fixing it again shortly.   If, even after cleaning, the chain is still rusty and stiff, you'll likely need a new chain. A rough, stiff chain can even damage your gears and derailleurs if left on for too long.  This tool, resembling a medieval torture device, is actually easy to use. Each link has two round pins in it, attaching it to the other links. Find the broken link, and note the pin that is keeping it attached to the rest of the chain. Slowly turn your chain break tool so the poker pushes the pin out of the link about halfway. Do not push it completely through.   If you have a spare pin (many chainbreakers come with one), then you should feel free to use this pin, as it will be much stronger and safer to ride on., Keep the pin still in the rest of the chain. You only want to remove the broken link, keeping the pin in the chain. This pin will attach to the open link on the other side of the chain to put everything back together., Before you fix the link, you need to get the chain onto the bike! Slide it through the pulley wheels they way you noted when you took the chain off. In general, the order is pretty intuitive, as there are small metal guards that hold the chain onto the gears. Simply thread the chain so that it stays between these guards and the pulley wheels.   To make pushing the pin in easier, turn the chain so that the exposed pin in the chain faces you, not the wheel., The link with the pin in it should be on the outside, so that you can push it through all four holes (two on each link) to complete your chain.  Before, you screwed the tool in to push the pin out of the link. Now you'll be screwing the tool in to push the link though. Work slowly, keeping your hand on the links to ensure it is all lined up.  It can also help to move the chain tool to the other side of the joint just made, and push the pin very slightly to free the two outside plates of the link from the central section, preventing binding.  Do not use WD-40, or any other product not made for bike chains. Flip the bike over and pedal it with one hand, dropping bits of lubricant onto the chain with the other. 10-15 drops should do. Then, use a damp rag and lightly pat down the chain of any excess oil. When you run a finger on the chain it should come up slick, but not covered in a puddle of lubricant.  More often than not, the bike won't even let you get into these gears, as the chain is not long enough to reach. However, the strain of trying to hit these bigger cogs will cause another break if you aren't careful.   Try to keep your chain straight between the front and back gears. Don't let it stretch diagonally across the gears by being all the way to the right on the front gears and all the way to the left on the back gears at the same time. This chain fix is generally temporary, and you should add a new link or get a new chain shortly afterward.	Take a picture, draw out, or memorize how the chain is currently attached. Shift the bike into the middle gears in both the front and back, noting which gears you're on. Remove the broken chain and clean it with a degreaser and water. Use a chainbreak tool to carefully push the pin halfway out of the broken link. Pull the broken link off the pin and discard. Thread the chain back onto the bike the way it came off. Fit the two end of the chain into one another so the holes line up. Use your chainbreak tool in reverse to push the pin through, completing the link. Grab the chain on each side of your newly connected links and move it from side to side to loosen up the new connection. Lubricate your chain with bike grease. Avoid using your biggest gear in the back gears, as the chain is now a link too short.
Inspect it for cracks. Discard if cracked as it will let the soil and water run out. If it's okay, wash it until clean, then dry completely.; , Tape the paper face to the bucket.   You can varnish the face too, if liked. This creates a waterproof outer.  Sprinkle grass seeds on top. Cover lightly with soil.  Soon you'll see grass popping up. Once it starts growing, it'll usually thrive.  Keep it well maintained. The kids will enjoy keeping the grass buddy's "hair" neat and at the same time, learn a lesson in tending to something growing.	Select a suitable plastic paint bucket. Draw a face on a piece of paper. Fill the bucket with potting soil. Water a tiny bit every day. Trim the grass regularly.
Most take at least 512 MB of RAM to run. However, at the minimum requirements, your notation software will run slowly and may experience errors. If you are planning to buy a new computer to use for composing sheet music, look for a computer with around 2 GB of RAM and 2 GHz processing speed. Finale and Sibelius are available for both the Mac and Windows XP.; , In order for your notation software to communicate with your synthesizer, your MIDI interface needs to be installed first. Your USB audio-MIDI interface will come with software and information from the manufacturer to help with the installation.  TASCAM makes a low-cost USB audio-MIDI interface called the US-122 that will help you get started in some notation software. However, Sibelius is only compatible with a few external MIDI devices. Check with your software manufacturer to make sure that your MIDI interface is compatible with your notation software. , This setup will allow your computer to sync with your synthesizer to record MIDI tracks on your notation software.  To do this, open the hardware setup function of your notation software and select the interface device as your active MIDI device. On most notation software, the hardware settings are under Edit or Tools in a section called Setup, Preferences or Options.  Add a track into your notation software and record some MIDI keystrokes from your synthesizer.  Then, create a track and enable it for recording.  When you are done with the track, press stop. , Double-check the parts by listening to them using your notation software's playback function.  You can choose to print the music in various sizes, as a conductor's score, in sections or individually by instrument.	Check your computer to make sure it can run notation software. Install your USB audio-MIDI interface. A USB audio-MIDI interface lets you connect audio input feeds and MIDI feeds to your computer. Install your notation software.  , Plug your synthesizer's MIDI-Out to the MIDI-In on your audio-MIDI interface, and the synthesizer's MIDI-In to the MIDI-Out on your audio-MIDI interface. Direct your notation software to recognize the MIDI coming from your synthesizer through the audio-MIDI interface device. Test your hardware installation. Start a new file. Begin recording on your notation software as you play the part you wish to record. Check the track for any errors and use the notation software's editing tools to clean up timing, clarify notation markings and fix any errors you might have made while playing the synthesizer.  , Repeat until you have recorded and cleaned up parts for all of the instruments that you wanted to include in your musical composition. Print your sheet music.
When you have a small space, everything in it counts. By arranging your furniture to open up your floor space, you can make your room look bigger. If you don’t have a lot of room, place your larger pieces of furniture near the edges of your room, not in the middle.Sometimes, if you have a few smaller pieces of furniture, you can place these pieces away from the walls. Placing a piece at a diagonal angle toward the middle of your room can give the illusion of space. Place your bed in a corner of your bedroom to open up the floorspace. Push your couch up against a wall in your living room to provide an open floor and pathway. One element of a larger looking room is the ability to move freely about it. Don’t place any furniture in areas that would block a view or ability to easily move about the space.; , The more furniture you have in any room, the more cramped and smaller it will look. Keep a small room tidy and organized. Start with what you need in a room, these are usually the bigger pieces of furniture like a bed or couch.   If you have a smaller room, consider only having a couple pieces of furniture in it. Use this piece of furniture to create a focal point. This is one area that draws the eye to it. In your living room, this could be your couch and table. Don’t add unnecessary chairs and knick-knacks, these will only clutter your space. Don’t hang too many paintings or pictures on your wall. Having a lot of items on your walls creates a cluttered look that makes the space feel more cramped.  Place your bureau next to the bed and use it as a nightstand. Look for furniture that serves more than one purpose. Get a bed frame that has pull out drawers or is elevated enough to place storage boxes under.   Use a chest as a living room table. It provides a surface to place things on, but also opens up allowing you to store blankets and pillows inside. Grab a storage ottoman. If you need an ottoman, get one with a lid to keep things out of sight when you don’t need them. Use an extra kitchen chair as a small bedside table., Get furniture that has open legs, or tables that are glass. Furniture that is elevated with legs makes a room look bigger because it creates more air.Furniture with legs or glass tables allow light to travel around, through, and under the piece, opening up the space. Attach a folding shelf beneath a window to use as a desk or ironing board. You can fold the desk up when you don’t need it Ditch the drapes and rugs when you can. Keep a space uncluttered and allow more light in by removing your drapes and rugs. Keeping your windows open allows for more light and depth to your room. A rug with the right pattern can make your room look bigger, but it can also separate parts of the room, making it seem more cramped.	Rearrange your furniture. Keep a small room sparse. Make use of hidden storage and multi-purpose furniture. Keep your furniture open.
Take a flat screwdriver and use it to turn the screwdriver slot and shut off the water from the flushometer.  You may also need to take a cover off where the screwdriver slot is too.; , You only need a wrench to loosen the top lid of the flushometer. After that, the lid screws right off.  It may also be necessary to use a piece of paper when doing so, so that you don't scrape the chrome on the flushometer.  Be warned that you may make a mess with some water when taking this cover off.,  There also may be a tiny weep hole too, which is what is causing the suction to release and the vacuum to seal up, also causing the flushometer to not be able to stop running the water into the toilet.  Clean it really well. You also will want to wash it out too.  Something very tiny in width should be used to clean the port of the weep hole. ,	Depending on whether your flushometer is facing left or right, there should be a slot for a flat screwdriver on either side. Take a wrench and screw the top lid of the flushometer off. Take the flange cover off. You will now see a gasket, which will have a lot of sediment. Take out and clean the gasket, including the weep hole.Follow steps 1 to 5 in reverse order (skipping the cleaning part, as you have already cleaned) to get the toilet working again, leaving it good as new.If this solution didn't work, you will need to replace the gasket.
Many libraries require you to present proof of residency in order to get a library card. Before you head to the library, gather two pieces of mail with your given name and address on them, such as a bank statement or utility bill.For children or teenagers, a parent’s proof of residency is usually requested.  Once you’ve proven residency, you need to prove you are who you say you are. Your library branch will require some form of ID. Although this is typically a state-issued license or ID, students may be able to use their school ID cards, as well., Libraries do not issue library cards online, so make sure you locate and visit your local library in person with the required documents. If you live outside of the area, you may also be required to pay a yearly fee.Although using online catalogs is possible, you have to have a library card before you can use library resources.  While at the library, set up your online library profile. This typically uses your library card barcode and a password of your choosing. Creating an online library profile is required to check out items digitally.   The way to set up your online account varies from library to library. Some will have simple instructions, while others will require a librarian to complete the process for you.	Gather two pieces of mail with your name and address. Take your state-issued ID. Visit your local library. Set up your online library profile.
This is the first and foremost thing you need to do. Once you feel you have the confidence to move forward, then you move to the next step.  This is most important if you want to have a chance to form a garage band that will stay together. Life expectancy of a garage band is 1 year. Many garage bands stay together for decades. This is because they all think the same way and as a band and a not individuals. Always think what is best for the band.  One cannot have a garage band without one. If you have a garage, empty the cars out of it. If the cars are already out of it, empty out sporting equipment, and ten foot wide paintings. A basement might work as well, however it creates problems for the drummer and when lugging a 25 pound amplifier down 70-year old wooden steps. Besides, garages are so much cooler. Having rugs lying around will help reduce the bass vibrations going all over the place. Make sure there is electricity and some dim lighting for setting a depressing non-conformist mood.  The most important part of creating a rock band. You need instruments to play, and although not always mandatory, you will greatly benefit by knowing how to play it, as explained in detail in step three. Necessary instruments are a drum set, Electric Guitar, and Bass. You may elaborate, adding another guitar, keyboard, organist, or solo singer. individual background singers are strongly unadvised, due to the high level of un-garageness. Although cheap instruments might look unattractive in the store, they're a bargain for your buck and add to the "grunge" appeal of your garage band. Stay away from fancy and "professional" equipment, as they also have a high level of un-garageness. For instance, buying a real Fender Strat could cost you up to $1200, what kind of Garage rocker would you be if you had that kind of money I ask you? Instead, go to a pawn shop and buy a $50 Strat rip-off missing a fret or two, and put some stickers on it.  The same rule basically applies to gear (amps, mics, pedals, etc.) as to instruments. Do not worry about getting cheaper gear, as long as it works and plays a decent sound. However, do not get too small an amp. You want something at least maybe 10"x10", as smaller amps subtract from the garage band feel, and are suited more for country-rock playing in the subway.  The name of your band might decide the fate of you. The name for your band may come in a variety of ways. It never hurt to have a cool name, it may be totally instantaneous, or you may lock yourself in a room for a week, using that as a source of inspiration. Whatever you do, make it sound unusual and unprecedented, try to think of something that would never happen like The Flying Hippos or something like "Sex Pistols" or "Nine Inch Nails" or "Slipknot". When choosing a name, it's wise to have something that either is so out there that people automatically want to listen, or maybe something ironic or vulgar, to attract attention in other ways  , Showing off your rock knowledge skills to everyone might increase your garage band stature. However, there are things to say and things not to say. Do not say, "Did you know that Jimi Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942?" Do say, "Did you know Jimi Hendrix died by choking on his vomit?" Instead of "Did you know that Ozzy had two #1 Albums with Black Sabbath," you could say, "When he was solo, he toured with Motley Crue, and one time on this bus, Vince Neal snorted an ant, and then to prove that he was more hardcore, Ozzy pissed on himself and licked it off".	Learn how to play your instruments. Find like minded musicians. Get a Garage. Have instruments. Buy gear. Name the band: Choose wisely. Immerse yourself in rock knowledge.
Do not plant an Ohia tree over 9,000 ft (2,743 m) in elevation. Ohia trees are not suited for high elevations, and will likely wilt and die if planted too high.Higher elevations likely have too little oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain an Ohia tree, and may not have enough humidity.  If you live in an area above 9,000 feet (2,743 m), consider finding a different species of tree to plant.; , Ohia trees need near-constant sunlight during daylight hours, and so should be planted in an open space that affords plenty of light.Do not plant your Ohia tree near a large wall or building that will block the sun. Similarly, do not plant the Ohia near a larger tree or bush whose foliage will prevent sun from reaching the Ohia.  Young Ohia trees and bushes that have not fully grown may prefer partial sun (about 6 hours of sun exposure a day), until they reach maturity. If your Ohia is in the ground, you won’t be able to change its sun exposure as it matures. However, if the Ohia tree is in a planter, you can move the planter to keep the juvenile tree in partial sunlight.  Ohia trees will become unhealthy if the soil they are planted in becomes saturated and waterlogged. To avoid this problem, plant your Ohia in a soil with good drainage. The soil should also be rich in organic material, which will nourish the growing Ohia tree and keep it healthy.You can purchase a planting soil mixture at your local hardware store, or at a local plant nursery or gardening center. Ask the sales staff for assistance, and request that they help you find a soil that drains well.  Unlike various other tree species, Ohia trees can be grown from seeds relatively easily.If you live in Hawaii, you should be able to purchase Ohia seeds or a small seedling at a local plant nursery or gardening center. If you live elsewhere, you can order Ohia seeds online. Check with plant retailers that specialize in Hawaiian flora, including Maui Native Nursery and Kauai Seascape nursery.  The seeds of the Ohia tree are tiny, and a cluster of them may look like a small pile of dust. These seeds grow in ¼-inch (0.65 cm) pods on the Ohia tree. The seed pods burst open when they have matured, and allow the seeds to disperse.  Fill any size planter with a planting soil mixture, and lightly sprinkle the tiny Ohia seeds on top of the soil. Ohia seeds will grow best if exposed to plenty of sunlight, so place the planter outdoors, away from shade. Water the seeds lightly at first, with a spray bottle, until they start to sprout.Even if you’re unable to place the Ohia seeds in full sunlight, they’ll likely still grow. The seeds are tough and can grow in practically any light conditions. The seeds will grow best between 50°F and 93°F (10–34°C). If the outdoor temperatures dip below 50 or climb above 93, bring the plant indoors to more stable temperatures.  If you can obtain a cutting from an Ohia tree in your area (perhaps from a tree owned by a friend or family member), you can use this to grow your own Ohia. Plant the Ohia cutting in soil that is porous and drains well, so the cutting isn’t drowned by repeated waterings.If the cutting is too small to stand erect in a pot full of soil on its own, you can stick a large dowel in the soil and tie the cutting to the dowel using thread.  Take your cutting from the stem or branch tips of a mature Ohia tree. The cutting that you plant should be about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length, and ¼-inch (0.65 cm) in diameter. A cutting will take time to begin establishing its own roots: at least a week or two.  Once the young Ohia tree (whether grown from seeds, a cutting, or a seedling) has begun to grow, you’ll need to transplant it from a pot directly into the ground. Plant the Ohia in organic soil. Ohia roots need to be able to absorb water but should never become waterlogged, so plant the tree in soil that drains well and is not prone to forming puddles.Ohia trees grow quickly, and will become root-bound if left in a pot for too long. Put the plant in soil in the ground as soon as it grows large enough to encourage healthy growth, or about 1 foot (0.3 meters) tall.  The Ohia roots will have sufficient room to expand in a hole of this size. Make the hole roughly the same depth as the root ball, so that the trunk of the seedling will not be buried once it’s planted.While you’re digging, turn the soil by breaking apart clumps, removing rocks, and flipping the shovelfuls of soil upside down so that the organic material can be worked through the soil. For added soil drainage, place a couple of cinder blocks at the bottom of the hole to allow for soil drainage. You should be able to purchase cinder blocks at a local hardware or landscaping store.  Once the cinder blocks are firmly in place, gently set the Ohia tree in the hole and cover the roots with a rich soil mixture. Be sure not to cover the base of the trunk with soil., Ohia trees thrive in tropical environments, and consequently need to be watered often. Plan to water your Ohia tree at least once a week, using water from a household hose. In order to keep the tree healthy and encourage its growth, you can also apply a fertilizer. Purchase an 8-8-8 or 13-13-13 fertilizer, and apply it to the base of the Ohia tree once every six months.Hours after watering, make sure that the soil is draining well. You should not see any puddles around the base of the Ohia tree, and the soil should be damp but not saturated.  Since Ohia trees frequently produce large, pleasant-smelling flowers, bees and other pollinating insects frequent the trees. Ohia trees are almost constantly in bloom, and so constantly attract insects.If you’re bothered by the bees or wasps, you can set up a bee trap or occasionally spray bees with an insecticide like Raid.  Also, avoid planting an Ohia tree within 10 feet (3 meters) of a door or garage. If large numbers of bees or wasps are frequently in the tree, they may fly into your house.  If you’re planning on growing more than a single Ohia tree, you don’t need to worry about giving the trees plenty of space in every direction, as with some other species. Ohia trees can grow well while crowded together. Plant multiple Ohia trees with as little as about 5 feet (1.5 meters) between their trunks.Over the years, as the Ohia trees grow, you may decide to prune some of the trees’ branches. Prune using a pair of pruning shears, in cases where branches from two Ohia trees overlap.	Avoid locations with high altitudes. Choose an area that gets full sunlight. Make sure that your soil has good drainage. Purchase Ohia seeds or a seedling. Plant your Ohia seeds. Plant an Ohia cutting. Re-plant an Ohia cutting or seedling into rich soil. Dig a hole that is twice as wide as the root ball. Place the seedling in the hole and cover it with soil. Water and fertilize the Ohia tree. Remove unwanted insects from the tree. Plant multiple Ohia trees near one another.
Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine. Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly.  Using a spatula or an old credit card, scrape any large pieces of crayon that may be left off of the dryer drum.  Get an old rag and spray it with WD-40.You should be very sure not to spray the drum itself with the WD-40, just the rag.  Use the rag to wipe at the spots covered in crayon. Try not to cover any more area with the WD-40 than you have to. This should allow you to remove all of the crayon without too much difficulty.   Switch which part of the rag you wipe with frequently to keep from spreading the crayon any more.  Once you've removed all of the crayon, or at least as much as you can, you'll want to mix up a bucket with soapy water and use a sponge or washcloth to clean the WD-40 out of the drum. Pay extra attention to the spots with the WD-40.  With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any crayon which might still remain.	Unplug the dryer. Scrape off any large remaining crayon. Spray a rag with WD-40. Wipe down the affected area. Clean the inside with soap and water. Run a cycle with old towels.
Find whether the sky is clear enough to do stargazing, also be aware of the temperature and humidity conditions and prepare adequately with the right clothing, equipment, etc.   A forecast for a completely clear, dry night means you'll probably be free of subtle haze. A breeze can mean less pollution near a city, but strong wind can be chilly.; , But an early setting or late rising moon may make this moot. Even with the moon, you can see bright things like the planets and bigger meteors in a shower.  You can stargaze anywhere provided the sky is clear and there is little light interference. (Some light from each source scatters throughout the atmosphere to interfere with the stars even if you're looking away from the light source.) It's best to head away from cities and large towns to where it is dark enough. Suitable places tend to be on higher hills (there might be some nearby), mountainous areas and desert-like rural areas.So, you'll need some way of getting to a good spot (bike, car, a lift from someone else). Another benefit of these out-of-the-way locations is that they're usually very relaxing.   Downtown in a big city, you won't see many stars. (If you see only two or three, they're probably planets.) In suburbs and small cities, you can see constellations. In rural areas without lights in your field of view, you can see the Milky Way.  Unless it's a hot summer's night, most outdoor night experiences will come with cool to cold air, and this can put a real dampener on wanting to stay outdoors for too long.   For winter or cold weather, the appropriate wear would include: A coat, hat, boots, mittens or gloves, and layers of warm clothing.For heavy-duty cold weather watching, you may also need thermal underwear, long-sleeved thermal t-shirt, thermal socks, a pouch for warming hands, face mask, insulated boots, and hand and foot warmers.For summer or warmer nights, the appropriate wear would include: A jacket or cardigan, long pants, long sleeved shirt, and possibly layers depending on the night temperature. It's a good idea to stargaze from home at first, if possible. That gives you plenty of opportunities to rush back into the house to adjust the warmth of your clothing if needed. You can then use this experience for stargazing trips that take you farther afield.  When you're out and about at night, there are a few things to be careful about when stargazing, to ensure that your experience remains both safe and comfortable:   Your visibility is clearly reduced, so you'll need to have your own source of light. Take along a quality flashlight or a headlight that is able to light up paths, terrain, and show possible snags like tree roots, rocks, etc. if you're heading along a trail to a stargazing spot. You can attach red cellophane to your flashlight to help your eyes adjust better to the darkness or get one that already has a red LED.You can even start this process by wearing sunglasses indoors before leaving, so that there is a gradual reduction of light on your eyes. Depending on where you are, you might also need to take along bug repellent. Remember that some insects like mosquitoes are night feeders, so you can be at higher risk for some diseases if you're stargazing where such insects tend to be found. Know the area where you're stargazing. You're somewhat vulnerable laying around staring nerdily at the sky at night, often with conspicuously expensive gadgets, so be sure that the area is safe. If you're not in your own backyard or on your own property, it is wise to be stargazing with someone else. Take a map if you're headed somewhere you don't normally go to, along hiking trails etc. A guide might also be helpful if you're doing some remote stargazing. Tell someone what you're doing and where you're headed if you're stargazing away from home. Give an estimated time of arrival back home and take along your cell phone. That way, they can keep an eye for you and can follow you up if you don't come back when you said you would. If you're a minor, always tell a parent or responsible adult what you're doing. If you're stargazing near a road or parking area, make sure you're far away enough and conspicuous enough not to get run over by a careless driver. Your car should be well away from traffic too, but you might want it between you and the direction from which danger might come.  You could simply turn your head up to the sky and stare but do that for too long and your neck will protest mightily! The most comfortable way to stargaze is to lie back and watch the heavens unfold before you; and you can also try sitting and looking up. To enable a more comfortable experience, try the following suggestions:   Bring along a folding chair or a reclining lawn chair to sit on. You won't strain your arms if you are stargazing using binoculars, nor your legs from standing too long. You can place a sleeping bag across a lawn chair for both comfort and added warmth. If you wish to sit or lie down on the grass, put out a lined picnic rug to prevent the cold from the ground seeping up. In addition, over this place a padded mat or a blanket. You can also bring along a cushion and sit on it and maybe a blanket to wrap around you. If sitting, place your legs out straight. This will let the blood in the veins flow or else your legs will go numb. Depending on how long you intend to stay outside for, the addition of a propane heater can make your stargazing experience more enjoyable. Be sure to keep it away from the telescope though as the glow and less-dense warm air rising from it (and within your telescope, if that gets warmed too) can distort the view.You'll need to be able to tote your gear with you; get a good day-pack, so that you're not overwhelmed by carrying things. A reclined front seat in an opened convertible is perfect if you're not using a telescope (the car is on springs, so it would wobble). Turn the car off and put on a blanket to stay warm.  Some things will make your stargazing experience a lot more enjoyable if you have them, especially if you want to see more of the stars than what the naked eye can see.   Deep-watch the sky using binoculars or a telescope. Do some broad-ranging research on which type of stargazing equipment to sink your money into before buying. You might prefer to borrow a friend's telescope or pair of binoculars and see what you like and don't like first. Bring along a compass to help you find things in the night sky, including reference stars by which to initially orient a "go-to" telescope. Or, better yet, use an automated sky map such as the smartphone application Google Sky Map: the GPS and orientation sensors will automatically choose a map for the direction in which the phone faces. A star chart or map is a wise choice for stargazers – try to find one that is laminated and that glows in the dark as this will be the easiest one to read and handle. A suitable camera for astrophotography if you like. It's relatively easy to photograph the moon or star trails.  Comfort definitely involves staying nourished and some warm drinks like hot cocoa, hot tea or coffee, or other favorite drinks are an ideal addition to your pack. Also take along something to nibble on, like energy or snack bars, some homemade cookies or cake, and perhaps some nuts or chocolate. Trail mix is another good option but be careful not to eat too much as you're not exactly hiking!   If it's a romantic evening, bring along champagne and truffles! Not too much unless you have a designated driver.  Your eyes need anywhere from five to thirty minutes or so to adjust to the light (or lack of it) in your chosen stargazing spot.Set up your spot and simply relax for a few minutes and hopefully by this time, your eyes should be ready to start stargazing. Start anyway, and expect more stars to come into view as your eyes continue to adjust. Enjoy your stargazing – amateur astronomers have just as much chance, if not more chances, of finding amazing new cosmic discoveries as the professional astronomers due to the time and dedication available.If you find it hard to spot faint stars, try using "averted vision". Look just to the side of what you're trying to see. Your peripheral vision is most sensitive to light and dark, making it easier to see faint objects when the rest of the sky appears gray.Consider keeping an observation log of all that you see. This will enable you to make comparisons, find anomalies, and build up a record over time.	Watch the weather reports, Forecast the Weather Using Clouds, or log-on NOAA.GOV (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the authority that meteorologists use, and enter your zip code on the main page. Check the phase and rising and setting times of the moon.The light scattered from a bright moon will likely obscure the stars too much for a good stargazing experience. Choose a suitable location. Focus on staying warm. Think safety. Consider your bodily comfort. Take along the right stargazing equipment. Prepare drinks and snacks. Give your eyes a time to adjust.

When you first begin roleplaying, your posts may not be as complex as those who have had more experience. Your sentences may be short and to the point. Although some people may ridicule you for your simple style, never be ashamed of it. As you roleplay more frequently, you will learn to adapt to the different writing styles. The harder you work on writing, the more you will improve until you too can write complicated posts.   As a person new to roleplaying, your writing may sound like this:  Burnshadow awoke and went out of his den to find his leader. His leader told him he needed to make a hunting patrol. Burnshadow went out with Riversky and Bluepaw and hunted in his territory. He came back with a lot of prey and went back to his den to sleep.  Rather than repeating the same word in your post, use a thesaurus to find descriptive synonyms that add flavor to your writing. Although you should avoid using too many big words, insert semi-advanced vocabulary words into your sentences for a colorful post.  Rather than simply stating them as they are, add more style and uniqueness to them by including detail. Detail is the key to capturing attention of readers, as it helps draw people into your writing. Although you should refrain from including too much, don't be afraid to lengthen simple actions. For example, if your character woke up and walked out of the den, you could say:   The sunlight pierced through the den. Burnshadow jerked awake with a meow, squinting into the searing rays. He slowly stretched his paws out and winced at the ache from his stiff sleep. Yawning, he rolled his neck before shooting out of his nest in search of his leader.  Instead of constantly using his name or pronouns, replace it with a short description of him. For example, replace "Burnshadow" with "the rowan-colored tom." This adds an interesting mix into your post, and it gives your readers an idea of your character's appearance. For example:   The rowan-colored tom padded into the Warrior's den. His eyes darted from nest to nest before focusing on his den-mate Riversky. The black cat was stretched out on his belly, a white paw tucked against his nose. With a soft sigh, Burnshadow padded over to the tom and nudged his head until his eyes blearily opened.  Showing rather than telling the scenes unfolds a new world for your readers. They will be able to see your characters come to life in front of them. You will also be able to weave your characters' personalities into their words using different tones and speaking habits (ex: A shy cat might speak more hesitantly while a bold cat may have more to say). Although descriptive sentences can be helpful when telling a story, you may need to break up your paragraphs with some dialogue to keep your readers' interest going.   For example, "Riversky, wake up!" could be an appropriate substitute for "Burnshadow asked Riversky to awaken." Beware of too much dialogue. Use enough to keep the story flowing, but avoid dumping too much information into conversations. Keep them short and to the point, writing them as naturally as a normal person would speak.  An emotional character provides the opportunity for readers to bond with him. Without feelings, a story would become uninteresting since people won't be able to empathize with its characters. Describe your character's emotional reaction to major events, but beware of revealing too much at a time. Learn to convey his feelings through his actions as well so that your story continues flowing.   For example, "A terrible scream shook the den. Fear gripped Burnshadow's heart. He froze in his nest, claws sliding out as his heart leaped into his throat."  , Delete unnecessary descriptions that distract readers from your story. Learn to be moderate in what you type. Remove extraneous details, and include additional descriptions where it is necessary. Keep your grammar at a top-notch level by using spellcheck or running a careful eye over your posts. Although it may take more time and effort, don't hesitate to stray from simple sentences and lengthen your posts.   Accept criticism. Rather than allowing it to discourage you, take the opportunity to extract as many lessons from it as possible. Learn to improve your posts as time goes on. The more constructive advice you accept, the better your writing will be.  Read the responses to your character's actions, and reply to them with an additional post. As time continues on, gather as much advice as you can in order to improve your writing. Perhaps one day you'll be able to start your own roleplay.	Head to the website's homepage.

Every time you tap your brakes, the cars behind you will do the same. This can cause a ripple effect for miles down the road. Try to keep a gap between you and the car ahead of you. If another car slows down or tries to merge, you should have enough room to slow down without braking suddenly.Keep at least two or three seconds between you and the car in front of you. This means that it should take you two or three seconds at your current speed to reach the other car.; , Try to stay at the speed limit, or go at the speed of traffic. If you need to slow down, take your foot off the gas, and do not brake unless you need to. In many cases, if you keep a gap between cars, you may be able to slow down without braking.When there's an accident or a breakdown on the side of the road, do not slow down to look. Instead, keep going at the rate of traffic.Cruise control can help you maintain a steady speed on the highway.  The more you change lanes, the more other cars may have to slow down to accommodate you. While you may sometimes need to move over, try changing lanes only when necessary., By letting cars in the merge lane come into your lane, you’re helping the flow of traffic. If you see cars trying to merge, allow a gap between you and the car ahead of you so that they have room to enter., Stay alert by scanning ahead as far as you can. Remain aware of what is happening around you. Watch for road hazards, accidents, bottlenecks, or other problems along the road.Many highways have signs that will alert you of delays or traffic jams. You can either prepare to slow down or find an alternate route.  Do not text, read the news, check your social media page, or take your eyes off of traffic, even if traffic has stopped dead. Always watch what is happening in front of you. You never know when traffic will start moving again.  If you are bored, turn on music or try a podcast.  If your car begins to break down, move to the slow lane, slow down, and pull over as soon as it's safe to do so. Turn on your hazard lights, and use your cell phone to get help immediately.If you are on the side of a busy highway, you should remain in your car. If you must exit, exit on the passenger’s side to avoid getting hit by a car.	Maintain a gap between cars. Stay at a consistent speed. Avoid changing lanes too often. Allow other drivers to merge into your lane. Pay attention to the road conditions. Avoid taking your eyes off the road. Pull over quickly and completely if you have a problem.
You can purchase your fabric from your local fabric store. If you don’t have a fabric store near you, you can order it online.   Fabric stores usually have a discount section. If you’re on a budget, check there first. You will need about one yard (36 inches) of fabric so that you have plenty of material to wrap around your head and tie in the back. You can use any type of fabric, such as cotton, linen, or rayon. However, these fabrics will fray on the edges. Other fabrics, such as jersey knit, faux leather, or vinyl will not fray. Of these, knit fabric will likely be the easiest to find in the color you need (and less expensive than the others).; , Be sure that the strip of fabric you cut is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and however long you need to wrap around your head. Leave enough extra to tie off behind your head.   It would be a good idea to measure around your head first and determine the length you would like your headband to be. Be sure to cut your edges straight. Lay out your fabric on a flat surface and use a measuring stick and chalk to create an outline for your headband.  If you have opted for a fabric that frays around the edges after being cut (such as cotton), you can apply an anti-fray aerosol spray to the edges to make your headband last longer and prevent wear and tear., You can use cardboard, poster board, or an aluminum can for a more authentic look.  If you are using cardboard or poster board, grab a measuring stick and trace an approximately 2 inch (height) by 6 inch (length) rectangle. Round each of the four corners. If you are using a recycled aluminum can, wash and dry the can first. Take some scissors and create a slit lengthwise down the center of the can (from top to bottom). Carefully cut around the top and bottom of the can and discard those pieces. Take the aluminum from the middle of the can and bend it back and forth to smooth it out.Measure and cut your aluminum (approximately 2 inches by 6 inches with rounded corners).  (Skip this step if you have used aluminum.) Choose a silver paint with a metallic finish, and but be sure to allow plenty of time for it to dry. Paint only on the side that will be visible once it is applied to your fabric.  Use a marker to draw the emblem of your choice in the center of your cardboard or aluminum piece.   If you are worried about making a mistake, trace the image with a pencil first. Don’t press down too hard, though, because the indentations will still show in your cardboard or aluminum.  If you don’t want your fabric to show through your emblem, use a permanent marker to draw the circles instead of cutting them.   Alternately, you could cut the backs off of six round, silver thumb tacks and glue them to the sides of your emblem plate.  When you are satisfied with the plate, apply super glue to the back of the plate. Press the plate firmly into the center of the middle of your fabric headband.Adding a phone book or other large book as a weight will improve bonding.  The instructions on your glue will tell you how long to wait. When the glue has dried, your headband is complete.  Wear your headband with pride as you represent your village.	Find or buy blue fabric. Cut your fabric. Treat your fabric. Prepare the plate for your headband emblem. Spray paint or hand paint your cardboard or poster board. Add your emblem. Cut or draw three holes on each side. Glue your emblem to your fabric. Wait for the glue to dry. Rock your headband.
This project requires leather or suede cord. Unravel 2 feet of the leather or suede cord and fold the cord in half. Wrap the folded piece of cord loosely around your wrist. Adjust the length of the cord so that you can easily wrap it around your wrist twice. When you have settled on a length, use a pair of scissors to cut the cord., Cut a piece of thread approximately 3 ½ feet in length. Slide the thread through the eye of the needle. Fold the thread in half and tie the ends together in several knots., For this project, you will need between 70 to 90 beads.   Bend the cord and align its ends so that they are even. Insert the needle into the exterior of the left cord, approximately ½ inch below the loop. #*Thread the needle through a bead. Insert the needle into the interior of the right cord. Pull it through the right cord. Insert the needle into the exterior of the right cord, approximately a beads-width below the bead above. Thread the needle through a bead. Insert the needle into the interior of the left cord. Pull it through the left cord. Repeat this process, moving down the cords one bead at a time, until your are approximately 1 ⅕ inches from the ends., Once you have finished adding beads to the bracelet, put a knot in the thread and cut off the excess string. Wrap the bracelet around your wrist twice. Insert one end into the loop at the top of the bracelet. Retrieve the other end and tie a knot to secure the bracelet in place.   Before tying the knot, you may add a charm to the bracelet for additional flare.,	Cut the leather or suede cord. Thread the needle. Sew a row of beads in between the folded-in-half cord. Finish the ends of the bracelet. Finished.
It is important to know what phase the moon is each night of the Leonids shower. The natural light from the moon can obstruct your view so that smaller meteors are undetectable and even bigger ones appear dim. Try to choose a night during the shower that the moon is in the new moon phase, or as close as possible.A full moon is the worst time to try and watch the Leonids meteor shower.; , The shower usually peaks around November 17th. Consult an astronomy website or news source to confirm the peak date for this year. Assuming that the moon isn’t full or nearly full on this night, it will be the best time to watch the shower.The next major Leonids outburst is scheduled for 2033. These outbursts are when the show is most impressive to watch., From midnight to dawn are the best hours to watch the Leonids meteor shower. During these hours, the sky is at its darkest. This makes it easier to see the meteors because there is less light interference., Try to get out and away from cities. You want to find a place with as little light as possible and a good view of the sky. Keep your eye turned to the darkest part of the sky, and avoid looking at any lights (including a cell phone). You should also give your eyes fifteen minutes or more to adjust to the low light.You could watch the shower from a mountain top or a clearing in the forest with a good view of the sky.	Research the moon phases. Find out the peak night for the shower. Choose the darkest hours. Pick a dark location.

This includes a rotary cutter, acrylic rulers, and a cutting mat. These tools are made for precise cutting. Quilter's worldwide wouldn't think of starting a quilting project without them. You’ll find that the more accurately you cut your quilt pieces, the more accurately your quilt top is sewn together. Olfa is an excellent brand, and is the leader in the quilting community.; , You can't start a quilting project without one. Now, you can buy the really expensive Rowenta professional iron, or, you can go to Walmart or Target and buy their $20 steam iron. Both will get the job done. They both last about the same amount of time, will both do a decent job, but one is a lot less expensive to replace. It is highly recommended to use spring water in your irons—tap water can lead to hard water stains on your quilt top, and most manufactures say that you shouldn’t use distilled water.  Most quilters have two or three of them on hand at any given time. Dritz makes a variety of excellent seam rippers. You’ll find they have everything from seam rippers with magnifying glasses to ergonomic seam rippers for those of us quilters who rip out stitches on a regular basis.  These scissors and shears are spring loaded to prevent hand fatigue while cutting repetitively. Quilting, and sewing for that matter, involves a lot of cutting. blunt tipped work really well for cutting threads, and a pair of sharp tip, which are good to use for cutting appliqué pieces. Most quilters own these. Fiskars, in this instance, is my brand of choice.  A quarter inch foot for your sewing machine will get you going toward an accurate ¼ inch seam allowance. Almost all quilt patterns instruct you to use an accurate quarter inch. Many sewing machines come with these feet. However, if you bought a simple hobby machine, you’ll most likely need to purchase one. There are so many brands for different types of machines that you’ll want to check with your local machine dealership to buy the right one. Don’t worry, they aren’t expensive, but they’re definitely necessary. You may even find them at your local quilt shop.	Select quality rotary cutting supplies. Get a decent steam iron. Find a good seam ripper. Invest in spring loaded scissors and shears. Have a ¼ inch foot.
If you're trying to identify a song simply using a melody, it is first important to consider how much of that melody you actually remember. Every little bit of information helps, and will increase the likelihood that a friend will be able to pinpoint the song for you.   Being a more attentive listener throughout your music-listening habits will make future scenarios like this much easier to grapple with.Take care to make sure that all of the information you think you remember is actually right. The memory can be a strange thing, and a few botched notes in your melody can lead your helper completely astray.  If you distinctly remember the song's melody chances are you'll know the genre as well. Many people prefer certain genres over others, and the ones that tend to listen to the genre of the song in question will subsequently have the highest chance of successfully helping you out.   Enlisting the help of friends with formal musical training is helpful too, as they are used to identifying music purely on the basis of melody.  Sit down with your friend and recreate the melody for them, whether with your voice or the piano. Take care to accurately reproduce the cadence and rhythm of the melody as well-- melody entails far more than a simple sequence of notes!   While you can technically recreate the melody on just about any musical instrument, it's actually recommended you try doing it with your voice. Especially if you're not a trained musician yourself, the human voice offers a lot of potential for expression. In singing the melody, you might be able to get some of the timbre and tone across as well, making your approximation that much more specific.  Part of what you're doing is trying to give them an accurate impression inside their head as to the song. That way, they'll have an easier time to pinpointing it.   Many melodies can be used by multiple songs, so providing a little bit of context can go a long way towards helping identifying the song in question.  Encourage them to ask you questions about the song. It is possible you still remember more than the information you've offered them. Give another hum to the melody once the two of you have discussed it a little bit, and see if either of you approach it any differently.   While you're talking and humming the melody, you should remain open to the possibility that you'll remember the song yourself, provided it's something you've forgotten as opposed to trying to identify it from scratch.  If the first person you ask isn't successful, you should try getting help from other people. In the case of identifying a melody, in most cases it's a simple matter of having it click instantly. What ends up leading to the brainstorming stage for some people may be an instant bid for others. Don't lose hope if you can't get it right the first time; find someone new, and begin the process again.	Consider what you know of the song. Find a friend who might know the song.Choosing the right person to help you has a lot to do with what you currently remember of the song itself. Play or sing the melody.Find somewhere non-distracting and relatively quiet; that way, there won't be uncontrolled factors hindering the process. Describe the other parts of the music you remember.Giving your helper some context as to the tone, rhythm and general style of the song can help them pinpoint a song just as well as any melody. Brainstorm.Now that you've given them the melody, you and your friend can brainstorm as to what it's about. Ask others.
Repeat for each seed you're preparing to plant.; , Keep submerged for twelve hours.  Plant each seed in the container. Plant the seeds deep in seed-starting mixture.  Expect the seeds to take anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months to germinate. Place the cotyledons in a water-based container for faster germination (this can speed up the germination process to between ten to twelve days).  When they are strong enough, separate and plant them in separate containers or in the garden. Expect fruit in about seven to twelve years; this is a slow process. Refer to the following section for growing the tree itself.  On the other hand, seedlings will take seven to twelve years before they can bear fruit.  Opt for a protected location that has full sun with sandy soil. (See "Tips" below for soil hints.)  , Blend ten pounds of composted manure into the soil.  When planting, ensure that its graft union is not over one or two inches higher than the bottom. , Increase the amount of manure it receives little by little, until the fully grown tree is being given around one hundred pounds per year.  It will produce its four-petal red or often yellow flowers in late winter or early spring. This will be followed by its apple-sized yellow or red fruit four or five months later, in mid-summer. Expect those fruits to fall after they are have ripened, at which point you can harvest them and enjoy their nutritional benefits.	Peel the coat off the 2-inch seed to reveal its white cotyledon. Immerse the cotyledons in a mixture of 550 ppm (parts per million) gibberellin (plant growth hormones) and water. Choose a planting container that is large enough to hold the seeds. Keep the seed-raising mix damp and warm. Keep the seedlings watered, mulched and fertilised once they take hold. Purchase a grafted tree rather than beginning one from seed if you have the opportunity, as grafted trees can flower in three to four years. Select the gardening site. Dig a hole sufficiently deep for taking the tree's roots. Plant the Cambogia tree thirty feet from the other trees. Water it well.  , Feed the tree another ten pounds of composted manure later within the year of planting. Know the fruiting cycle of your Cambogia.
If you want to make different colors, divide the flour up into separate bowls. How many bowls you use will depend on how many colors you want. The best part about using flour and baby oil is that it stays nice and light, clean-looking, and a little less like sand (and the kids might just believe that it's from the moon).  It is a lot easier to mix dry materials with other dry materials than with wet. If you plan on adding any color, glitter, or scents, do so now. Be sure to mix it into your flour well. Here are some powders that you can add to your flour right now:Add a tablespoon or two of powdered tempera paint, powdered water color, or powdered chalk if you just want to add color. If you are using an oil-based food dye, hold off for now.Add some powdered drink mix, such as Kool-Aid to give your moon sand a color and a nice smell. Add in a few teaspoons or tablespoons of glitter to give your sand some extra powder. Add in a sprinkle of spices, such as pumpkin pie, apple pie, vanilla sugar, cocoa, or cinnamon if you want to give your moon sand a nice smell.  If you don't have any powdered paint or spices, you can still color and scent your sand by adding stuff to it. Here are a few suggestions:To color your moon sand without powdered paint, try using oil-based food coloring or oil-based candy coloring. To scent your moon sand without spices, add a few drops of essential oil or baking extract (like vanilla or strawberry).  Once your color is mixed in (or not, if you want a blank slate), add in 1 1/4 cups of baby oil. It'll probably be easiest to just mix it up with your hands, though you'll get a bit dirty. Or you could just let the kids do this step!  , Once everything is in—color, scent, glitter and all—mix it all up thoroughly and get to playing with it. What'll be your first creation? A giant octopus? A castle? The moon itself?   If you're dealing with small children, just make sure they don't get any in their mouths. Baby oil and flour isn't dangerous, but paint or chalk added into the mix won't be any fun.  Moon sand does keep for a solid month or two, but you'll probably find that you want to make more anyway before the first batch gets old. But until then, store this batch in an air-tight container in a cool, dry place, like your pantry or in a child's toy box.   When you go to pull it back out for playtime round two, revive it with a couple tablespoons of water. It will come back to life and be just as good as new.	Pour the flour into a large bowl. Add any powder-based colors, scents, or glitter to the flour. Add any oil-based scents and colors to the baby oil and stir well.Water and oil do not mix, so regular food coloring or liquid water colors will not work. Add the baby oil to the flour. Mix it up and play with it. Store in an air-tight container.
You can buy shelves from your local bike shop or online. They range from $20 to hundred of dollars.   If you want to easily store items like bike tools, panniers and cleaning cloths along with your bike, buy a shelf with extra hooks or cubes.       If you want to display your bike inside your home like a piece of wall art, get a decorative shelf that is beautiful as well as sturdy.	Instead of purchasing a standard hook or bike rack, consider a bicycle shelf for your storage needs. Determine which type of shelf you need based on several factors.
When you see the first green shoots poke through, move the seedlings to a sunny area. Make sure the room temperature is above 70 degrees, but provide a bright space so they can grow strong and healthy.  If you covered your seedlings with a sheet of plastic wrap or newspaper, remove it and keep the seedlings moist with a couple of waterings a day. Water in the morning and early afternoon, but avoid watering later in the day. If water sits on the growing medium all night long it might facilitate the growth of mold.  Since the growing medium doesn't contain nutrients, you'll need to fertilize the seedlings with plant food after they've gotten a few inches tall. Find out what type of plant food is appropriate for the seedlings you're growing. Use organic fertilizer if at all possible.  If a lot of the seeds germinate and sprout, it's necessary to thin out some of the weaker seedlings so the strong ones can get even stronger. Thin them out to the point where you have 2 or 3 sprouts per seed container, or 2 or 3 sprouts for each area the size of one egg carton segment. Pick the extra sprouts out close to the base, pull out the roots and discard them.  When the growing season begins it will be time to move the seedlings to bigger containers or your outdoor garden. Make sure you get the right type of soil for your plants, and plant them in an area with the correct amount of sunlight and drainage.	Move the seedlings to a sunny place. Keep the seedlings moist. Feed the seedlings after a few weeks. Thin the seedlings. Transplant the seedlings when it's time.
To make a stele out of a pencil, you'll need: a pencil, a hot glue gun, hot glue sticks, a sharp tool like an X-Acto knife or a dotting tool, paint and a paint brush and a makeup sponge.   Make sure to get silver paint for the base coat of your stele. If you want other decorations, choose the colors that work for the design you had in mind. You should be able to get most of your supplies at a local craft store.; , First, you'll need to remove the eraser as you'll eventually be adding a tip to the eraser end of the pencil using glue and paint. You should be able to remove the eraser simply by using your fingers. However, if it's on particularly tight you can use a pair of pliers. Slide the pliers between the metal casing of the eraser and gently wiggle them until the casing falls off., To make a stele shadowhunter, you need to create a casing of glue around your pencil. This will be painted over in silver later to create the look of a stele. To do this, load a stick into your hot glue gun.   You'll want to do this over either paper towels or newspaper, as hot glue tends to get everywhere. Starting at the eraser end of the pencil, apply hot glue in rings around the pencil. After thirty seconds to a minute, the glue that you've already applied will be cool enough to touch. Test it by touching it with your finger. If it's not too hot, rub the pencil between your hands to spread the glue down the pencil.Keep rubbing the pencil between your hands. This will allow the glue to spread down the pencil, covering it an even casing. Apply extra glue as needed. Keep going until your pencil is covered in an even casing for glue. As you apply glue, there will be thin strains of glue that hang from the glue gun to the pencil. If you want, you can tear these off the glue gun and wrap them around the pencil with a finger. This will add some interesting texture to your stele.  How smooth you make the base layer of the stele is up to you. If you want it to have a lot of bumpy uneven texture, you can leave it as is. Or you can roll it along your fingers and between your palms to smooth out the hot glue. Smooth out the glue while it's still slightly warm and wet. Dry glue may be hard to smooth out., On the eraser end of the pencil, add a few more dabs of hot glue. Then, smooth it out the base to form a cylindrical top to the eraser end. The idea here is to make the base end thicker than the rest. You want to give the stele a wand-like appearance. It can help to look up images of shadowhunter steles and try to manipulate the glue to mimic their basic shape., Many shadowhunter steles have a snake-like design winding up their side. This is one of the easiest designs to create on a pencil stele. Simply place the tip of the glue gun on the eraser end and slowly draw a line spiraling around the pencil until you reach the tip.Keep in mind shadowhunter steles come in different shapes. If you feel more proficient at the glue gun, you can try to draw pictures of symbols using the glue gun. However, if you've never used a glue gun before it might be best to stick to the basic serpent design for your first try.  Use your X-Acto knife, a sharpened pencil, or some other small sharp object, work on the base of your stele. The easiest design is to carve out a small circle at the eraser tip, creating a kind of dot in the center of the tip. If you feel comfortable, consider adding your own unique design., You can use either acrylic paint or nail polish to paint the stele. Start with a silver paint. Use your brush, or a makeup sponge. Dip it in some silver paint and cover the whole stele in silver. If you want, you can stop here. However, you can add other colors or designs depending on the type of stele you're trying to emulate. For example, you can color the serpent-like design green and add markings like a snake. It's up to you and what you want your stele to look like.Leave the graphite tip unpainted if you want to use it as a pencil.	Gather the materials. Remove the eraser. Apply hot glue. Smooth out the glue. Form a base out of hot glue. Add hot glue to create a snake design. Add details to the eraser end using a sharp tool. Paint the stele.
If you use your toilet brush for a few seconds every day, you can pick up excess water. This will make it less likely that hard water spots will form and save you the trouble of an intensive clean., Bleach can be a good disinfectant. But it will cause rust stains to set, making it more difficult to remove some hard water spots. It can also be dangerous when mixed with other toilet bowl cleaners., Older toilet bowl cleaners had metal bristles. These could scratch up the insides of a toilet. This is counterproductive, because once a toilet bowl is scratched, it is easier for dirt to get into the scratches and next to impossible to get it out., When you flush with the bowl open it is possible for water to escape, getting some all over the toilet. This is unsanitary and increases the risk of hard water marks forming., If given the time, these stains will only settle in and become more difficult to remove. If you see stains appearing that can’t be removed with a simple scrubbing, immediately use either vinegar or heavy cleaning solutions to pick them up.	Brush daily. Be cautious with bleach. Avoid metal bristles. Close the bowl before you flush. Perform an intensive clean as soon as hard water marks appear.
You may need a ratchet wrench as well, depending on the vehicle requirements.   Access will be from the inside of the trunk or cargo area on an SUV or typical car. You need to pull away or unscrew the cover from around the back of the broken taillight/turn-signal cover to gain access. This exposes the bulb connections at the back of the taillight. Grip firmly at the back of the bulb and push it in. Twist counter-clockwise to remove it from the broken taillight/turn-signal cover. You will either need to unscrew the broken taillight/turn-signal cover from the outside or unbolt (or unscrew) it from the inside of the cargo area or trunk, depending on how the taillight/turn-signal cover is held in place. , Check to see if the taillight/turn-signal cover is working once it is reinstalled.  Those made prior to 1960 could have a separate taillight and turn-signal cover. However, the tools are the same.   You will find a screw holding the taillight in place on the back of the bed on some small trucks. Unscrew and remove the taillight/turn-signal cover from the bed. You will have exposed wires in the bulb holder once you have pulled the taillight/turn-signal cover from the bed. There may be more than one bulb holder. Disconnect the bulb holder by gripping it firmly at the back and pushing in. Twist counter-clockwise and remove the bulbs from the broken taillight/turn-signal cover. Reverse the process and install the new taillight/turn-signal cover and check to see that it is working properly.  Other than that, it is the same procedure as above.   Reverse the process as noted above and install the new taillight/turn-signal cover and check to see that it is working properly.	Use a screwdriver and, possibly, a set of open-end wrenches or sockets. Pull the lens away from the body of the vehicle.  , Reverse the procedure. Understand that the procedure for replacing a broken taillight/turn-signal cover will be a little different for a small truck or pickup, depending on the age. Unscrew the cover from inside the bed, exposing the back of the taillight/turn-signal cover to unbolt the broken taillight for removal on some newer trucks.
For soldering electrical components into printed circuit boards, the best soldering irons are Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) safe, temperature-controlled, high-power irons. These will let you solder for hours, and are good for complex amateur radio projects. For simple kits, an inexpensive pencil iron will do just fine.   Use a fixed power soldering iron, 25W for small jobs, and 100W for larger jobs with heavy cabling. If possible, variable temperature irons are available, which will make for the safest treatment of the boards. The tip temperature can be controlled to suit the size of the job.; , The most common solder alloy used in electronics is 60% tin and 40% lead, sometimes notated as 60/40. This alloy is recommended if you are new to soldering, though it is somewhat hazardous, requiring proper ventilation, breathing protection, or a soldering iron with a vacuum attachment.   Various lead-free alloys are becoming popular recently. These require higher soldering temperatures and do not "wet" as well as Tin-Lead alloys. However they are safer and can be more effective. 96.5 % tin to 3.5% silver is the most successful and will produce a joint with less electrical resistance than any tin-lead alloy. Both lead and lead-free formulations are available online at places like solderdirect.com and in your local Radioshack or Home Depot store.  Flux is an additive in solder that facilitates the soldering process by removing and preventing oxidation and by improving the wetting characteristics of the liquid solder. There are different types of flux cores available for solder wire.   Rosin is most commonly used by hobbyists. After soldering, it leaves a brown, sticky residue which is non-corrosive and non-conductive, but can be cleaned if desired with isopropyl alcohol. There are different grades of Rosin flux, the most commonly used is "RMA" (Rosin Mildly Activated). No-clean flux leaves a clear residue after soldering, which is non-corrosive and non-conductive. This flux is designed to be left on the solder joint and surrounding areas. Water-soluble flux usually has a higher activity that leaves a residue which must be cleaned with water. The residue is corrosive and may also damage the board or components if not cleaned correctly after use.  Mostly, electrical soldering deals with "through-hole" components, which are pressed into printed circuit boards (PCBs). Through-hole components have leads (wires or tabs) that pass through a hole in the board and are soldered to the pad of metal plating around the hole. The hole may be "plated through" or not.   Soldering other electrical items such as wires or lugs, have slightly different techniques, but the general principles of operating the solder and iron are the same.  Electrical components are usually quite small, and you'll need tongs, needle-nosed pliers, or tweezers to hold them in place while you operate the soldering iron and negotiate the solder. It can be a balancing act.   Some kind of clamp or stand is usually best to hold the board in place while you solder the components.  Select the correct component by checking it's type and value carefully. With resistors, check their color code. Bend leads correctly, if necessary, being careful not to exceed the stress specs, and clinch leads to fit the board.  Always solder in a well-ventilated area, using breathing and eye protection. Make sure to prop up the iron when it is on but not in use. Irons can start fires quite easily by burning into your workbench.   Seven to twelve inches of space should be between the electronic components and your face, or it may jump into your eyes. Solder may splatter.  Melt a small blob of solder on end of the soldering iron. This process is called tinning and it helps to improve heat flow from the iron to the lead and pad, keeping the board safe from the heat.          Carefully place the tip (with the blob) onto the interface of the lead and pad. The tip or blob must touch both the lead and the pad. The tip of the soldering iron should not be touching the nonmetallic pad area of the PCB, or any of the fibreglass area surrounding. This area can be damaged by excessive heat.  Flux from the solder wire is only active for about one second maximum after melting onto the joint as it is slowly burned off by heat. The lead and pad should be heated enough for the solder to melt not the connection point. The molten solder should "cling" to the pad and lead together by way of surface tension. This is commonly referred to as wetting.          If the solder does not melt onto the area, the most likely cause is insufficient heat has been transferred to it, or the surface needs to be cleaned of grease or dirt.  No more than a drop or two of solder should be necessary for each joint, though it will vary slightly for different components. The correct amount of solder is determined by:          On plated-PCBs, you should stop feeding when a solid concave fillet can be seen around the joint. On non-plated PCBs, you want to stop feeding when the solder forms a flat fillet. Too much solder will form a bulbous joint with a convex shape, while too little solder will form a concave joint.  Unfortunately, it's quite easy to damage a component or the board with too much heat. For the most part, however, you can keep the components and the board safe by moving swiftly. Keep a finger on the board nearby to ensure that it doesn't get too hot.   Try to err on the side of irons that are slightly less powerful than you think you might need. Use a 30 watt iron and practice soldering quickly so as to avoid excessive heating. If working with a double-sided circuit board check both sides for good solder joints. A good joint will look shiny and cone shaped. if it looks frosty and dull then it is a cold joint.  Some components (diodes, transistors, etc.) are quite susceptible to heat damage and require a small aluminum heat-sink clipped on to their leads on the opposite side of the PCB. Small aluminum heat sinks can be purchased through electronics supply houses. Hemostats (small) can also be used.  After a proper application of solder, the solder will be shiny and not dull. Visible indications are the best way to know if your solder joint is good. The solder needs to melt with the surface of the electronic components, rather than the tip of the soldering iron. This way, when the solder cools, it forms an alloy with the surface of the metal.   The solder joint should coat the surface of the component evenly, not too much such that it forms a glob, nor too little such that it does not completely coat the surface.  Burnt flux, rosin from the core of the solder, or plastic sheaths from wires may all burn onto the soldering iron. Such contaminants prevent the formation of a clean alloy between the electronic components. This is undesirable, because it raises the electrical resistance and also reduces the mechanical strength of the solder joint. A clean tip is shiny all the way around, without burnt gunk on it.   Clean the iron in between each component that you solder. Use a damp sponge or steel wool to clean it thoroughly. Tip thinner may also be used.  This cooling should only take five to ten seconds. If the components are too hot to handle, use needle nose pliers, or a tool called helping hands which consists of two alligator clips attached to a little articulated stand. If you watch carefully, the cooling solder will settle right before your eyes.  It's important to practice on throwaway stuff before you move straight to trying to solder something important. Gather some old junk boars and burnt out components from a junked radio or other electronic device to practice on.   Nobody is perfect, not even the professionals. Don't be ashamed to repeat a bit of soldering work. It will save you time in troubleshooting later.	Use a soldering iron with the appropriate heat control. Use solder wire of an appropriate alloy. Try to get flux-cored wire if possible. Get the necessary board and components. Get a clamp to hold the components. Prepare the components for soldering. Be extremely careful and solder in an appropriate location. "Tin" the solder. Feed the solder onto the interface between the pad and lead. Stop feeding the solder interface is filled. Move quickly. Consider using heat sinks for sensitive components. Learn to recognize when there is enough solder present. Keep the soldering iron clean. Make sure to let the solder cool completely before moving the components. Practice on junk components.
FUNimation, Viz Media, and Sentai Filmworks always put age ratings on their releases. Also, if you live in the UK the 'BBFC requires everything have an age rating on it, so there's no need to worry about unrated anime.; , Even shows airing in Japan currently have age ratings submitted by people who have watched the show and gave the rating from their best judgement.  See what other people have to say about the show. Sometimes the description can be a bit "blurry", but there's clearly going to be an age rating difference between a show that says "Hamtaro and his friends have fun adventures all around town!" and another one that says "In a post-apocalyptic world, a man (stalker) chases after attractive girls."  , Every parent has different standards as for what is appropriate, so you may want to watch shows you're iffy about before you allow your kids to watch them.	Check the age rating. If the anime hasn't been released on DVD yet, check MyAnimeList.net. Check the reviews and description. Watch the show yourself.

Aluminum foil is a good scrubber for a hot glue gun. Rip of a square of a aluminum foil and wad it up in a ball. A big piece is a necessity because it will help keep you from burning your fingers., With the glue gun warm, push the tip into the ball of foil, making sure you don't burn your fingers by touching the tip. Rotate the tip or the ball to scrub it, taking off glue and other debris., Once you're done with the tip, rub the rest of the gun down with the foil. The gun should be warm so that the glue is easy to remove. It should scrape off most of the glue., Set the glue gun on its side, preferably on a silicone mat. Lay a single piece of foil on top of the glue. Rub the foil in, using protection on your hands so you don't burn your fingers. Go over it with the heat gun or blow dryer. The glue should stick more to the aluminum foil than the glue gun, so you can easily peel it off. Repeat the process as needed.You may need to remove parts, like the kickstand, to help clean the whole gun.	Tear off a large piece of aluminum foil. Scrub the tip with the foil ball. Rub the glue gun down with the aluminum foil. Heat the glue gun using a heat gun or blow dryer.
A miter saw can be used for PVC projects that require many specific, detailed cuts. Use a tooth-count saw appropriate to the cutting job and the saws available. When in doubt, go with something like a standard 10 Tooth per-inch (TPI) wood blade, which comes with most miter saws. It'll depend on the particular brand and style of saw that you've got, though.  Miter boxes are the easiest things in the world to use, since you've got the cut-lines pre marked alongside the box for you. You won't be able to miss.  Start the blade and bring it down at a fairly slow to medium speed. Once cut, the process can be repeated with ease, making additional cuts in the pipe as necessary.	Consider using a miter box and saw for more specific cuts. Place the PVC pipe under the blade where you need your cut. Secure the pipe with a work clamp.
To prevent the spread of disease through contact with the plant or soil, throw them away immediately with your regular trash before doing any more work in the area. Further prevent the disease from spreading by disinfecting your tool immediately after pruning each leaf. Have a solution of 1-part bleach to 4-parts water within easy reach..; , Prune the infected leaves, including those that have turned yellow or are about to, since these are most likely too far gone to recover. If the infection is widespread, it’s better to prune off entire limbs rather than just removing leaves. Treat what remains, including the leaves’ bottoms as well as their tops.Although there is no guaranteed cure for black spot disease,try the following remedies, which can slow and prevent the disease from spreading, and use whichever shows the best results:   Mix together a solution of 1 tbsp. baking soda, 2.5 tbsp. vegetable oil, 1 tsp. liquid soap, and 1 gallon water. Be sure to use liquid soap, not detergent. Since this may potentially burn your leaves, spray a small test area with the solution before spraying the entire plant. If burning is absent or minimal, spray the leaves once every two weeks.Combine 1-part dairy milk to 2-parts water. Spray the leaves once each week. (Sorry, vegans; non-dairy milk substitutes won’t work).Spray the leaves with neem oil once every two weeks.Use fungicides as a last resort if the disease returns for multiple growing seasons.Follow their directions regarding applications. Apply them early, before outbreaks or at the first sign of spots, since they are preventative in nature. Choose organic products if possible for both the plant’s health as well as pollinating insects., Remove them from the area as soon as you prune them. Put them with your regular garbage, preferably in a tied bag. If you dump them straight into a trashcan, secure the lid firmly to prevent the wind or animals from blowing or tracking them free.   Do not add infected leaves to compost, since the disease may survive and infect other plants when that compost is used as mulch.	Prune infected leaves immediately.Ensure the overall health of your plant by removing diseased leaves entirely. Treat infected areas. Throw away infected leaves.
The weights are typically listed as bulky, worsted, sport, etc. Most yarns will have this written on the label, but sometimes they might have a number that correlates to the weight instead. For example:0: Lace 1: Superfine or Fingering 2: Fine or Sport 3: Light or DK; , You can find this near the top of the pattern, often just below the yarn and hook recommendations. It will tell you how many rows and stitches there should be within a set of inches/centimeters. It will typically be written as:   Gauge: # stitches and # rows = 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters) # stitches and # rows in single crochet = 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters)  , Making your square larger will help make measuring more accurate later on.For example, if the pattern calls for a 4 by 4-inch ( 10.16 centimeters) gauge swatch, your starter chain should be 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters).  In most cases, this will be the single crochet stitch, often written as "scs." If the pattern calls for something different, such as double crochet, then you should use that instead.   Again, make sure that your square is a little bit larger than what the pattern recommends.  Some crochet patterns recommend that you steam or block the finished piece. You should treat the gauge piece the same way as you would the finished work. If the pattern says to steam of block the finished project, then you should do the same to the gauge piece.A simple way to block is to place a towel over your swatch, and then iron it using lots of steam. Remove the towel and let the piece cool before moving on., Make sure that you can see your stitches and rows clearly. Also, make sure that the swatch lays smoothly; there should be no bumps or ripples.  Make sure that the square inside your swatch is the same size as the gauge. For example, if the gauge is 4 by 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters), then your square should be 4 by 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). You will count your stitches within this square.  If your stitches are very small, you might find it easier to count them with a pencil or knitting needle. This way, you won't accidentally count two small stitches as one stitch.   Consider writing down the number of stitches and rows on a scrap of paper.  In order for the gauge to be correct, the number of stitches and rows within that square must match up to the pattern's gauge.If you have too many or too few stitches/rows, then you will need to make some adjustments, and make another square.  Sometimes, the gauge will be off, even with the correct hook size. This is usually due to working too tightly or too loosely. A quick fix is to simply use a different sized hook. Keep making swatches and changing hook sizes until your gauge matches up with the pattern's.If your swatch has too many stitches and rows, you are crocheting too tightly. Go up a hook size. If your swatch has not enough stitches and rows, you are crocheting too loosely. Go down a hook size.  If you are crocheting too tightly, then avoid tugging as much. This will help loosen your stitches. If you are crocheting too loosely, then work tighter by giving the yarn a slight tug after each stitch.  Some yarns are just thinner than others, despite being the same weight. Other yarns are easier to work with, or "stretch" better. Try to use a yarn that is similar to the one in the pattern., Keep making adjustments and squares until your gauge matches the pattern's gauge.	Read the project instructions and select the correct yarn weight and hook size.Some instructions will specify a brand name and material for the yarn, but you can choose something else as long as it's the same weight. Find the gauge information on the pattern. Make a foundation chain about an inch or so longer than the recommended gauge swatch. Crochet a square using the pattern's recommended stitch.The pattern will tell you what stitch to use for the gauge. Block the square, if necessary. Lay your swatch down on a flat surface in a well lit area. Mark out a square on your swatch using sewing pins and a tape measure. Count the number of stitches and rows in your swatch. Compare them to the pattern. Change the hook size if the gauge is off. Try making your stitches a little looser if you can't get another hook. Try a different yarn. Create another square and measure again.
If you draw the pattern on a piece of paper or tissue paper, this will allow you to insert it inside the glass, secure it, and use the pattern to transfer and paint over the design. Tissue paper will be easier to work with as it bends much more easily.   You by no means need to create a design that requires a sketch. Geometrical and abstract patterns are just as beautiful, if not more so. If it'd be helpful, use tape to devise a pattern on the outside of your glass; you can then easily paint around it. Same goes for the stem and base!  , There are so many products out there, it's tough to know where to get started. The simplest way is to sketch your design and secure it with tape on the inside of your glass. You have a couple more options, however:   Place your sketch inside your glass and fill it with something like a sock or quilt batting. The soft interior will keep it in place, intact. Buy self-adhering stencils at your local craft supply store. If you can fathom its existence, it can be found. Stencils come in sticker form nowadays, and you can just plop them onto your glass and paint away.  Use a fine point sharpie (or marker that will not wipe off) to sketch a design on the glass. If you don't like your sketch, you can use a q-tip or cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover to "erase" the marker or paint.   This outline will probably remain visible. If you want to go for a more of a "One Stroke" method, skip sketching directly on the glass, and just paint using the sketch underneath.  As with stencils, it's easy to walk into the paint aisle and feel absolutely overwhelmed. There are a handful of varieties to choose from and the differences are really only nuanced -- they'll all create something pleasurable to the eye. What you choose is just a matter of current mood and taste.   Enamels (like Folk Art or Martha Stewart) are water-based and especially geared toward glass painting.They can handle the dishwasher if cured (not necessarily the microwave, however) -- but some require a primer and top coat (like PermEnamel), so note the label.Acrylics work, too. However, it generally depends on the quality of the paints you choose -- some are more prone to washing off. If you do go the acrylic route, spray a high-quality varnish on top (they have sparkly ones!) to secure the paint to the glass.There are acrylics that are designed more for glass painting. If acrylic is your jam, use this variety.   Regardless of what type of paint you end up using, you'll probably encounter air dry and heat dry forms. In general, the glasses that are baked (require heat drying) last longer.To add more spice to the mix, you'll also have the option of choosing transparent (light will pass through), opaque (light will not pass through), and frosted paints. Decisions, decisions. They've officially thought of everything -- glass paint markers are available, too. They bake on and make even the most detailed of glasses beginner-doable., Though it should go without saying, paint isn't fun to pick off your favorite sweater or your grandma's mahogany table. Go change your clothes, and lay down several layers of newspaper or wax paper -- anything to protect those surfaces. And take the dog outside.   While you're at it, open the windows. Being high on paint fumes isn't the state you want to be in for this project!  , Glass painting methods number no fewer than canvas painting methods. This part is entirely up to you. But if you're looking for a little inspiration, here's a few jumping off points:   Create a marbleized glass by pouring your paint over your piece, top to bottom. Pour in a thin even layer, rotating the glass consistently. Alternate colors as desired. Liquid fill paints will be best for this method.Use just one color and pour on until completely covered to create a solid painted glass.   Use tape to make stripes. Just after you've painted between the stripes, take it off; if the tape is taken off when the paint is dry, you risk chipping the paint. If you have any quirks in your stripes, just take your craft knife and carefully chip away until the lines are straight. Get polka-dotting. The blunt end of your paintbrush is great for dots, or you can use a dauber or spouncer. To do this effectively, never come in or go out at an angle. Always place your tool straight down and take it straight back up. Use sponges. Whether it's a dish sponge or a sponge brush, you can create interesting, layered designs with a dab of paint -- little skill required. Add colors on top of each other to create shading and highlighting. That's just painting 101.  Don't forget the stem and base! Half of your "canvas" isn't the actual glass (if you're using a wine glass). For the base, consider painting the underside to achieve an is-it-there-is-it-not-there look. You know the kind.  If you were wondering about paintbrushes, unless you're an avid painter, they're all pretty much the same. But if we're splitting hairs, the synthetic ones will be more stroke-y; natural-haired brushes will paint a smooth, complete picture., Resin-based paints are incredibly temporary until baked and can even be removed with warm water.If you absolutely must remove the paint, do so quickly.	Sketch your design first on a piece of paper. Secure your stencil to the glass. Sketch the design onto the glass. Choose your paints. Prep the area. Start coloring. Remove paint with nail polish remover if corrections are needed.
Wrap a measuring tape around your head like a headband: under the back of your head, up the sides, and over the top of your head. Record your measurement, then subtract 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). This is your new measurementIf you don't have a measuring tape, you can use some ribbon or string instead, then use a ruler to subtract 4 inches (10.16 centimeters).; , Choose a wider ribbon—something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide would be ideal. The ribbon can be satin or grosgrain. Satin comes in more colors, but grosgrain comes in more patterns., Light a candle or ignite a lighter. Hold the cut end of the ribbon close to the flame for a few seconds, or until the cut edge melts. Repeat for the other side., The elastic should be narrower than your ribbon. Something between ½ and ¾-inch (1.27 and 1.91-centimeter) wide would be ideal. If the elastic is super stretchy, you may want to cut it a little shorter to make the headband tighter., Turn the ribbon so that the wrong side is facing you. Squeeze out a drop of hot glue on one end. Make sure that it's centered., The end of the elastic needs to overlap the end of the ribbon by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Make sure that the elastic is centered., Make a small drop of hot glue on the ribbon to the left of the elastic. Fold the edge down onto the elastic and press it into place. Repeat for the right side., Place another drop of hot glue on the other end of the ribbon. Press the elastic into place, then glue the side edges down. You do not need to glue the side edges down along the entire ribbon—over the elastic.	Measure your head, then subtract 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). Cut your ribbon according to your new measurement. Seal the ends of the ribbon with a flame. Cut 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) of elastic. Make a dot of hot glue on one end of the ribbon. Press one end of the elastic into it. Glue the side edges of the ribbon down onto the elastic. Repeat the process for the other side of the ribbon.
Breathing correctly is imperative to having a strong voice. The key is to breathe deeply:   As you inhale and exhale, try to inflate your stomach and kidney (back) areas with your breath. To ensure that you’re breathing into these areas, place your hands around your waist, with your thumbs on your back, your fingers at your front, and your palms resting on your sides down towards your hips. You should feel your hands expand and contract with each breath. Over time, as you strengthen your breath, these expansions and contractions will get bigger and longer. If you have trouble breathing deeply, try lying on the floor on your back, with your hands on your stomach. When you inhale, your hands should rise; when you exhale, your hands should lower.Note that your shoulders should not be moving up and down with your breath.; , When you’re breathing correctly, when you inhale, the lower muscles (diaphragm) over your abdomen should move outward, making room for more air. As you sing (or talk or just exhale), use those muscles to push the air back out.   Use the muscles over your lower back (around your kidneys) in exactly the same way to control your inhalations and exhalations.  Pay attention to the position of your feet, knees, hips, abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms, and head:Your feet should be slightly apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other so that your weight is slightly forward. Your knees should be relaxed and slightly bent. When aiming for good posture it can be tempting to lock your knees; be careful not to do this. Your hands should be relaxed and hanging at your sides. Your abdomen should be relaxed but ready to be engaged. To get a sense of how an engaged abdomen feels, place your hands on your waist (with your thumbs on your back) and cough very lightly. Your shoulders should slide back and down so that your back is straight and your head is high. Do not hunch or pull your shoulders up towards your ears. Your chest should be slightly up and out— this will likely happen naturally when you pull your shoulders back and down. Your chin should be parallel with the floor — neither lifted or pointed downward.  Once you’ve moved into the correct posture, check in to make sure that you are not holding tension anywhere. It should not feel as though you’re forcing your chest out or your back to be straight. Be sure to relax your face and your neck.   Singing or speaking while your body and face are tensed will only make it more difficult to produce a high-quality sound.  Your mouth should be wide open when you sing, but avoid the temptation to open it so wide that your face and neck muscles tense up. Check in to make sure that your lips, jaw, and neck feel loose and relaxed.  A common piece of advice from professional singers is to create space in your mouth. Opening your mouth wide is part of how you can do this; another part of creating space involves dropping your jaw and tongue, and lifting your soft palate (the ridged flesh at the roof of your mouth).   To do this, breathe in as you would before yawning, but try not to yawn. Pay attention to the space this creates in your mouth, including the open feeling at the back of your throat. You want to replicate this wide-mouthed, soft-jawed/lifted palate position when singing., When creating space in your mouth, make sure that your tongue is out of the way. Let it rest softly at the bottom of your mouth, with its tip touching the back of your lower teeth.   Try not to stick your tongue out or wave it around while you’re singing, as this will impair the quality of your voice, and could reduce the richness of your tone.  Too much saliva in your mouth might make it difficult to sing, so remember to swallow before starting!  , Before singing or doing more demanding vocal exercises, you’ll benefit from doing some of the following simple exercises to warm up your voice:Yawn. Yawning will help stretch and open your mouth and throat, and can help release tension in your neck and diaphragm. To trigger a yawn, try opening your mouth wide and breathing in.Cough very gently. Think of it as lightly pushing air out from the back of your throat in short bursts. This will help you engage your lower chest and abdominal muscles, which are the muscles you should use while singing (as opposed to your throat/upper chest).Do gentle lip rolls. Hold your lips lightly together and blow air out of them while humming. Focus on having a relaxed throat and an engaged core while you do this. Practise lip rolls going from a low to high note and vice versa. Once you’re used to the lip rolls, practise doing scales with them.To help your body learn to relax while you sing, tense up your body and then right after releasing the tension, do a lip roll from low to high; repeat, this time going high to low.Humming is another gentle way to warm up your voice. Try humming along with music on your way to school or work or, if you’d prefer not to do that sort of thing in public, hum while you cook or while you’re in the shower., Starting as low as you can comfortably sing, gently move up the scale using a “me” sound until you reach the highest note at which you are comfortable. Then, move down the scale from high to low using an “e” sound.Don’t push your range — be gentle with it, letting it increase over time. You can also do this with an “oo” sound.  Your mouth should look as though you’re sucking in a long string of spaghetti as you inhale. When you exhale, make a “woo” sound. It should sound buzzy, similar to the sound made by a kazoo. Keep the sound steady as you exhale; do this 2 to 3 times.Next, go up and down your scales using the “woo” sound.  Say groups of single words or entire phrases without stopping between the words — treat them as a single word. Lengthen the vowels and exaggerate the vocalization of each word as you say and/or sing it.As you speak/sing, imaging that you’re filling a room with your voice. Focus on smooth transitions: when switching between higher and lower, and louder and softer parts of a song, imagine moving up and down a ramp — not a staircase. Example words: moon moan mourn mane mean.Example phrases: many men munch many melons, A lot of vocal exercises can sound and look pretty funny. Relax and have fun with it. Two fun and silly exercises that help open up your throat:   Sing “meow” slowly, emphasizing its three sounds — mee, ahh, and ooo. Make weird faces by stretching out your tongue in all directions. You can do this while singing or even just making weird noises.  As with physical exercise, cooling down after doing vocal exercises is important. One way to cool down is to do the same simple vocal warm-ups you started with (for example, yawning, light coughing, rolling your lips, and humming).Another way to cool down is simply to gently glide up and down, and down and up, on the sound “m”, so that you feel a tickling vibration in your lip/nose area., Whether you're warming up, singing, or giving a speech, breathing deeply and keeping your body, throat, and face relaxed are key to ensuring a high-quality voice.  Drink at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day — more if you exercise or live somewhere hot (i.e. if you sweat a lot)., Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables promote a healthy voice by keeping the mucus membranes that line your throat healthy., These include smoke (even second-hand smoke), spicy foods, milk products, foods with a high-salt content (ex., bacon or salted nuts), citrus fruits, alcohol (including mouthwashes that contain alcohol), and cold and allergy medications., If you body is fatigued, it will show in your voice.Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night; teenagers should aim for 8.5 to 9.5 hours each night.If you get at least 7.5 hours of sleep each night and do not wake up feeling refreshed, see your doctor to ensure that there are no underlying reasons for this., Stress affects everything negatively. Take time every day to do something that helps you relax. Relaxing activities include yoga, meditation, walking, watching a show you love, reading a good book, or playing an instrument.  This is particularly important if you have a performance coming up. Shouting can strain your voice and diminish its quality for even a few days after.  If the quality of your voice has recently diminished — for example, become raspy, deeper, or strained — it may be a sign that you are experiencing a health issue. To be on the safe side, see a doctor to rule out potential health issues., It could take some time to improve the quality of your voice. You won’t see enormous overnight results, but you likely will feel some difference almost immediately after combining proper breathing and posture with some simple warmups.   It’s okay to take it slow. Start with learning how to breathe more deeply and stand correctly. Once you’re comfortable with that, work on your mouth position and some simple warm-ups.  A good teacher can give you detailed feedback and advice on how to improve your voice. Aim for someone with classical training, as a classically trained teacher is likely to have experience with a variety of styles.If you can’t afford a voice coach, there are many online lessons available for free. Just type “singing lessons” or “voice coach” into YouTube, and you’ll have a wealth of videos to choose from.  Listen to the way they handle their breath, volume, articulation, control, vocal habits, and resonance. If you’re particularly fond of their style, see if you can replicate it.   Replicating someone’s style is a great way of learning to sing, because it forces you to try things you might not normally try when singing.  Pay attention to how they breathe and support the notes with their breath. Note their posture and body language. Watch the way they use their lips to shape the sounds and words that they are singing.  Think about why you dislike a certain singer or speaker. What do they do differently from the ones you like? Are they doing something wrong or is it just not your style?  , It is amazing what a good sound engineer can accomplish during a recording session. If you really like an artist's recordings, try to figure out how much is real and how much is engineered before you decide that "you can never sound as good as that!"  , Ask those whose voice you like what they are doing to get that sound. Most will be flattered and pleased to share this information with you.	Learn to breathe. Use your abs. Learn the correct posture. Relax. Have an open but relaxed mouth. Lift your soft palate. Ensure your tongue is positioned correctly. Remember to swallow. Warm up. Sing scales. Practise “woo” scales. Practise smooth projection with words and phrases. Be prepared to feel silly. Cool down. Remember to breathe and stay relaxed. Drink enough water. Eat for a healthy voice. Avoid substances that can irritate your vocal folds. Get enough sleep. Relax. Avoid shouting. Get help. Be patient. Find a good, professional teacher. Listen closely to professional singers and speakers. Watch professional singers and speakers. Don’t ignore professionals you dislike. Compare the way an artist sounds in a live performance to the way he or she sounds in a recording. Go to open mics and other local music events.
Tablature is a visual guide that will teach you how to play notes of songs if you don't know how to read music. Since many people don't know how to read music, tablature is becoming increasingly popular.  As boring as they sound, scales are actually very important in the development of serious musicians. Learning scales will help you practice your fingering, improve your speed and agility, as well as help you to solo/improvise.  A solo is when a musician sets off on their own and plays a musical passage that's distinct, varied, and sometimes improvised. Soloing can be hard, but it's also rewarding.  When you get to the point of starting to be bored playing other people's music, it may be time to create your own. Composing your own music takes a lot of time, practice, and false starts, but having your own song is like nothing else in the world.  Some of these techniques include sweep picking (with fingers or with a pick, it's harder with fingers), tapping, tremolo picking (again, harder with hands than with a pick) and slapping/popping.  If you are at this point, it means that you really like what you are doing. You may be bored with always tuning and detuning your bass, so having 2 or three can save you some time.	Start learning tablature. Begin to learn scales. Try your hand at soloing. Start composing your own songs. Learn some advanced techniques when you feel you are ready. When you feel the need of having two or more basses, go for it!
Use a good houseplant potting medium, not garden soil. Repot it in a larger pot each spring or divide the old plant into several smaller ones and repot them in a fresh potting medium.; ,   Put your spider plant in an east, west or north windowsill any time of the year. Put the spider plant in a south window during the winter months or 12” (30.5 cm) away from a south window in late spring and summer. Provide bright fluorescent or other lighting and spider plants will do fine. Provide light shade to deep shade for spider plants that are used outside.    Use room temperature water. Use distilled or purified water, if possible. Let the pot surface feel dry to the touch before watering. Water until water drains from the bottom and empty drained water from trays promptly. ,,	Pot your spider plant correctly. Place your spider plant in the right light. Water the spider plant correctly. Fertilize spider plants once a month in the spring and summer with houseplant fertilizer mixed according to label directions.  , Keep spider plants between 40º and 85ºF (4.5º to 29.5ºC).  , Groom spider plants by trimming off dead leaf tips or leaves with scissors.
It will tell you if you have the option to pay the ticket online, or if you must appear in court.   Note the county in which you received the citation. A California Highway Patrol ticket is payable only to that county's court. Look out for correspondence from the county court by mail. Most counties will send you information about paying or contesting a traffic ticket. You will also be told if traffic school is an option.; , You must wait a few days for your citation number to be entered into the system, so wait at least 2 business days after you got the ticket, and at least 2 business days before it's due.   Be sure to pay by the due date. Most counties in California will not accept payment online if a traffic ticket is past due.  You will see a list of 58 counties. Click on the one where you were ticketed.   Each county has a different website, and a different way of handling online payments. A few counties, like Kings, for example, do not allow you to pay your traffic ticket online. However, most of these counties provide a number that you can call and pay your citation with a credit card.  In general, there will be a button that says "Pay a traffic ticket," or "Paying your traffic fine," or similar words.   Most have links to pay a ticket, request a court date and possibly request traffic school.  Enter your name, address, and driver's license number. Enter your citation number as listed on your ticket.  Most payments must be made by either credit card or electronic funds transfer.   If you choose to pay with a credit card, enter your credit card number, expiry date, security code, name and billing address, as required. If you choose to pay with an electronic funds transfer you will need to enter your bank routing number and account number as well as your name, address and bank. The routing number and account number are listed on the bottom left of most personal checks.  Check the box to plead guilty or no contest to the citation. You may also have an option to choose traffic school. Finalize the process using whatever button means "Submit," and look for a confirmation that your citation has been paid.   A no contest plea means that you will not admit to guilt but you will receive the same punishment as if you plead guilty. A no contest plea is often used to avoid admitting guilt in the case of future lawsuits.	Read the citation carefully. Schedule time. Go to the California Pay Traffic Fines page. Click the Pay... button. Fill out the online form. Choose the payment method. 'Fess up.
In the USA, pet food labeling is regulated on a federal (FDA) and state-by-state basis, with guidance from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). However, AAFCO provides only minimum requirements. The reality is that pet food producers often use terms that are undefined by the regulations, in order to communicate more effectively with consumers and improve their product's image in the market.  The AAFCO warns on their website that "it is not rare at all that labeling and marketing information is designed to appeal to the latest trend in marketing human products." In other words, the focus tends to be more on appealing to our preferences than on whether or not the food is suitable for your pet. For this reason, learn to look behind the marketing hype and to find the real substance of the nutrition status within the pet food.        It is important to always check the ingredient list because a named food is not always necessarily the primary ingredient.; , See the example under "Tips" below. Note that the percentages given for protein, fat, and fiber are measurements of the food in its current state. However, because different pet foods have different levels of moisture, you can only logically compare pet foods on a dry matter basis. Moisture levels in pet foods can range from approximately 6 percent to as much as 80 percent.  Canned food obviously contains more moisture than dry kibble. But it may not necessarily contain as much protein, for example. You can't tell which food contains the most protein, fat or fiber until you have converted both labels to a dry matter basis.       Determine the amount of dry matter first, by subtracting the percentage given for moisture from 100 percent. Using the example below, the moisture accounts for 10 percent of the pet food. Therefore, the dry matter content is (100% - 10% = ) 90% of the pet food. Convert the protein, fat and fiber percentages to a dry matter basis by dividing the percentages given on the label by the amount of dry matter (from the previous step). In our example, the 26 percent protein on the label converts to 28 percent on a dry matter basis by dividing 26% by 90%. (Notice that in this example the dry matter calculation is only slightly different than the labeled percentage. This is because the moisture level was only 10 percent per the label. If the moisture level had been, say, 40 percent, then the dry matter content would have only been 60 percent and protein on a dry matter basis would have been calculated as (26% divided by 60% =) 43%.) Compare the new protein level of 28 percent on a dry matter basis to other pet foods (once you've converted the other pet food labels in the same way). Do similar comparisons for fat and fiber after converting to a dry matter basis calculation.  You may have 28 percent protein on a dry matter basis, but what is the source of that protein? You can get protein from chicken beaks and feet that are not good sources of nutrition for your pet! This means that you'll need to look next at the list of ingredients. Pet foods must list ingredients in order of weight.  Generally, the first five ingredients will make up the majority of the pet food product. Ideally, look for meat as one of the first ingredients on a pet food label. Grains, such as corn, cornmeal, whole wheat, barley, rice are used to provide essential energy for the pet and appealing texture to the kibble.       Even the AAFCO website admits that "Economics plays a part in any ingredient selection" and "protein is not simply protein. Ingredients providing protein have specific amino acids which may or may not match the amino acid profile required by a cat or a dog." Manufacturers routinely combine multiple protein sources to provide for all the amino acids required for a healthy life.  For example, by breaking an ingredient down into components and then listing them individually so that you don't notice an easily recognized undesirable ingredient too near the top of the list, this information can be effectively changed enough to cause you to read the label differently.  However, some animal by-products like liver and other internal organs are excellent sources of the amino acids and other nutrients that dogs and cats need. In addition, dry pet foods need preservatives to prevent spoilage and degradation of essential nutrients.   Contact the manufacturer direct to find out what the "by-products" listed in their product actually consist of. Be aware that this may change without warning. Sometimes your pet's reaction will be enough to make this obvious!  , The density of dry products can be changed through puffing up the food, while different wet foods can be labeled with pounds or ounces (or other measurements), making weight comparison harder. Check the price comparison to get the real value.  This is one of the most important aspects of a pet food label because it can impact a pet's health if claims are made about being nutritionally complete when the product is not able to meet all nutrient requirements for your pet. To be reassured on this count, look for:   The words: "(Name of product) is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO (Dog/Cat) Food Nutrient Profiles." Or look for the words: "Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that (name of product) provides complete and balanced nutrition." Be sure to choose the right life cycle stage for your pet - this should be on the label too (for example, kitten/puppy). Pet food needed for pets that are growing, reproducing or working hard should be chosen with care that it can meet all the nutrient requirements for that pet. Size, breed or senior labeling claims must meet the criteria for adequate adult pet nutritional needs; in reality, the more precise claims are harder to ascertain.  Even if you think you know how to feed your pet the particular product, changes do happen or you might have transposed feeding instructions from one product to a new one. Always read these with care to ensure that you are feeding your pet adequately. However, even though manufacturers try to cover all contingencies, you still need to monitor your own pet's needs, preferences and environmental conditions. Talk to your vet if you're unsure, especially with respect to growing and reproducing pets.And don't forget to visit the vet every month or so to be sure..   As part of feeding, also read the calories provided by the product. The amount of calories provided can vary considerably between products and between dry and wet foods. If your pet is growing, overweight or underweight, or has an illness, calories are of especial interest. Calorie statements are made on a "kilocalories per kilogram" basis. Kilocalories are the same as the "Calories", while a "kilogram" is a unit of metric measurement equal to 2.2 pounds. It may also be stated as "per cup" or "per can", alongside the required kilocalories per kilogram statement.  These are marketing words without official definitions to back them up. While it is surely to be hoped that all pet food is "natural", this usually refers to a lack of artificial additives, colors or flavors. The words "premium" and "gourmet" and the like are marketing speak and don't mean anything more than what the overall packaging suggests to the consumer. Organic pet food should be free of synthetic additives but guidelines are still under development for the official meanings.	Learn to look beyond the marketing claims accompanying pet food. Locate the "Guaranteed Analysis" on the pet food label. Be aware that percentages alone don't tell the whole story. Be mindful that pet food manufacturers can manipulate this information. Some pet owners search for pet foods that use human grade ingredients with no animal by-products and avoid pet foods that use artificial colors, flavors, sugars and chemical preservatives (notably BHA and BHT). Do a cost per weight analysis to determine the weight value of the pet food product. Check the label for "nutritional adequacy". Read the feeding instructions. Be savvy about marketing claims such as natural, organic, premium, etc.
Direction of prevailing winds and/or seasonal cross-winds.       Drainage of area. Slight sloping (2% maximum grade) is okay.       Cost of construction.       Access to buildings and or roads.       Local, State and National guidelines governing private airstrips. Crosswind strip if crosswinds are common in your area.       Safe, barrier free approaches, even if strip will never be used at night.;	Consider the following factors:   Flatness and/or the amount of work required to level the area.
However, instead of 'braiding' the elastic together now, place another one on top of the elastic, so that you have two loose elastics on top of the base one (at the stage of the the X formation).  Flick it on top of the two other elastics and do the same thing to the other side. ,	Start the process as outlined in method one. Grabbing one side of the base elastic, pull it away from the fork. Complete normally as for method one.  , Finished.
Be sure that the surface is not tilted, or the system will not work properly.  If the container you have is designed for a multi flow system, it should automatically turn the power on and off as the water levels in the container change. Thus, this is a safer and more efficient flood/drain system than those used in ebb and flows (see next section)  , Ensure that everything is working properly.	Place your six pots on a stable surface. Connect them with the PVC fittings and tubes. Put the plants in the small plant trays.
This is an especially useful method for removing small-to-medium-sized dents, and you may have more of these then you think. Examine your car carefully to find them all.; , Dents can typically be removed using this method if they are located on the metal panels of the trunk, hood, doors, roof, or fenders, and are not right along the edges on broad flat surfaces.To achieve the best results, use this method on shallow dents that do not contain major creases or paint damage, and that cover a surface area with a diameter of at least 3 inches (7.62 cm).  You will need a hair dryer, heavy-duty or thick rubber gloves for safe handling of the dry ice or compressed air in its liquid format, aluminum foil, and either a package of dry ice or a can of compressed air. You will need some of the following:   Heavy-duty insulated rubber-coated gloves. A full (or nearly full) can of compressed air. A package of dry ice. A hair dryer with adjustable temperature settings, such as "Low," "Medium," and "High," or "Cool," "Warm," and "Hot." Aluminum foil.  Turn on the hair dryer and use it to blow hot air over the dent and the surrounding area for one to two consecutive minutes.   The hair dryer should be set to medium and should be held between 5 and 7 inches (12.7 and 17.78 cm) away from the car's surface. Do not overheat the area in order to prevent the paint from becoming damaged due to overheating., Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the dented area. This step should only be performed if you are using dry ice instead of compressed air. The purpose of this step is to keep the area warm while also protecting the paint from the dry ice, which can potentially damage the topcoat.  The gloves will protect you from frostbite and other injuries that can occur when your skin comes into contact with dry ice or liquified compressed air.  The rapid change in temperature from warm to cold will cause the surface of your vehicle to first expand (when heated) and then contract (when cooled).If you are using dry ice, grab a block of the ice with one hand, then gently rub it over the aluminum foil resting on top of the dented area. If you are using a can of compressed air, turn the can upside down, and spray the surface of the dented area to cover the area with a layer of liquid ice. There are some basic principles of science at work here: the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas are all interconnected. While normally the can loses temperature as the gas is released, if you spray the can upside down the gas itself is cooled.Either method will only require a brief application. The surface panels of most modern vehicles are made of relatively thin and lightweight material and they will cool very quickly. You will likely not see any change after the first 30-50 seconds of application, if not sooner still.  A few moments after you have applied the dry ice or compressed air, you may hear a popping sound that will indicate the dent has been removed. The rapid temperature shift will usually make the material reform its original shape.   If you used dry ice, remove and dispose of the aluminum foil after the dent has been removed. If you applied liquid ice by means of compressed air, wait for the white foam to dissipate from the surface of the car, then wipe residue away with a gentle cloth.  For certain dents a single application may not be enough. If you see improvement but a dent is still noticeable, you can begin the process of heating and cooling again. However, do no overuse this process (especially in a single day). While the rapid temperature changes can reshape your car exterior, the extreme cold is potentially hazardous to the paint.	Find your car's dents. Evaluate the dents. Obtain the materials needed to remove the dent. Apply heat to the dented panel. Insulate the dented area of the panel (if applicable). Put on the heavy-duty gloves. Apply the dry ice or liquified compressed air. Wait for a little while. Repeat the process as needed.
If you are only expecting 20 or 30 people for an audition, even your garage may do. If you need a larger space, try renting out hotels or venues function rooms. These often are quite cheap to rent during the day, which is the most likely time to hold your auditions.; ,   If you're auditioning people to become members of a band, you may need to supply amps, leads, microphones etc. If you need a drummer for a band, you will most certainly need to have a drum kit available. Not many drummers will cart their expensive kits to an audition. Other instruments won't be necessary as most people will only play their own instruments If you're auditioning an actor or singer for a musical, you may need microphones also, and a stereo or PA to play music through. But more importantly you may need someone to play out parts with them. This should not be too difficult to organise if you are in charge of hiring people!  ,   Open Auditions are where you have a start time for auditions and anyone can turn up. This is done on a first come first serve basis. Set Auditions are where you do not list the time or location of your auditions on your advertisements. You just put a contact number up, and when people ring you, you give them more information and a specific time and date for their audition. Though this sounds more complicated, this is often easier and seems better organised. Also, you know how many people are going to show up before they arrive. Posters should follow this guide: AUDITIONS What type(s) of performer is required Age and sex requirements Time and Date (optional) Length of audition Contact number, website and email    , If you're not artistic/confident enough to make your own get them professionally done. Posters put up in venues, music shops, colleges and schools, drama clubs etc. are often the most effective. But there's no harm in placing advertisements in local papers. Another way to guarantee auditions is to ring Talent Agencies and Agents which can be found in your Yellow Pages. Only good performers are picked up by these businesses. Make sure to be safe about where you decide to put up your advertisements. ,, Also ask them to bring passport style, photos so when you're debating which to accept afterwards you will remember every person. This form should have:     Name Phone Number Address Email Address Age    , Often the most talented are the busiest! So try to accommodate them in a separate/private audition.  The panel should always consist of at least two people, at least one man and one woman, unless you are running an all male or all female band. This looks more professional and one on one auditions can be disconcerting. ,, Don't give away your decision either and tell every person auditioning that you'll get back to them.	Find a place large enough to hold the audition. Get the equipment you require. Decide whether you are going to hold 'open' or 'set' auditions. Make your advertisements. Set an exact time limit on a person's performance and make sure they know this before they come.  , If they are auditioning for a part in a film or play, provide them with a script as soon as they decide that they would like to audition.  , Create forms for when people arrive. Try to accept every person that rings for an audition, even if they can't make in on your assigned day. Get together a panel of interviewers, and a few people to organise queues etc, if holding a large audition. Get the organisers to make a few refreshments for the people auditioning, this shows you care!  ,Make sure the place where the people are auditioning is separate from the people waiting to interview, this helps calm nerves and will make it more fair  , Always give constructive criticism if you have any but don't be mean. Once the auditions are over, make your decisions and inform the person you've accepted first, then ring/email each person saying that you're sorry but that you'll keep their form in case another opening becomes available.
Dress like you would if you were the right age to see the movie. (Girls, don't overdo it.) Don't wear high school logos on clothes (college and university logos are great, though - if you look like a college student, people automatically assume you're at least 17 or older). Guys - if you can grow a little facial hair, don't shave two days before the movie so you look older. Also, try to lower your voice to an older-sounding tone.  Figure out what you're doing ahead of time. Practice your lines at home so you're comfortable saying them. For example, if you look over 17, pick a fake birthday ahead of time. The easiest way to catch someone lying about their age is by asking them about their birthday. If you stutter trying to think of a valid birthday, they won't let you in. If you look like you're 18, say your birthday was today and you left your ID at home.  If you can, go with friends that are over 17. It makes it less obvious that you're under 17. Going with a friend might make it a bit less nerve racking if it is your first time sneaking in, and if you do get caught you're not alone.  If you get caught sneaking in, don't panic! Make an excuse such as, "Oh, my parents are in there, I just had to go to the bathroom". Sound realistic when you do. If you get caught doing the movie switching method, a good excuse is "Oh, sorry! I guess I got the wrong entrance." You might want to look around while saying it to make it more realistic. Never run away if you get caught. That will not only anger whoever it is that chases you down, but also draws even more attention...possibly an ill-mannered manager. While making an excuse can save you from being caught, running immediately makes you look guilty and will have you kicked out of the theater.	Look the part. Practice and prepare yourself. Go with others. Figure out your escape plan.
Stains tend to pick up and accentuate flaws in the surface, just like wood stain does with wood knots. Keep in mind that staining is not the same as covering.   You may consider laying new concrete, if the surface is cracked and deteriorating. Hire professionals to pour the concrete.; , Cement stain is semi-transparent and color is added and mixed just as it is with traditional house paint.   You can also buy acid stain; however, it can be more difficult to apply yourself than other concrete stains. It will also take longer to apply because you must neutralize the stain after it sets. You can choose 2 different colors of concrete stain to create a marble effect. Use a lighter color as your base coat, and a darker color on the second coat.  You should always test the color before applying to an entire section of concrete.   Clean the section of concrete with an industrial washing product, like TSP. Apply the stain according to package directions, usually by wetting the concrete and applying with a roller. , One gallon of paint will cover 200 to 400 square feet. Buy enough to do 2 coats, if you want darker, more even coverage.  Work in 4 x 4 foot sections.  These will show through the concrete stain.  Move on to the next section, working across the section of concrete you need to clean.  You need to be careful not to track on any dirt, or the stain will not be even.   Consider setting up tape or barricades during the cleaning and staining process, if you are near a public area, such as a sidewalk.  Tape it down with painter's tape, if possible.  You can also apply with a roller, but the paint sprayer will apply even coverage.  Days without wind are also best for using paint sprayers.  It should be a mist of water, light enough so that water does not gather and run, leading to an uneven application.  Spray sections of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m) and then move on to the next section.   If you are using 2 different colors to create a marble effect, do not wait to apply the second coat. You can apply it immediately after the first coat.  This is usually 24 hours.  If so, wet the top of the stain with water and apply a second coat just as you did the first.  Check the surface for any sections that were not fully covered. Spray them by hand. , Choose a time when the concrete patch is shaded.  Use a roller with a very long handle for floor application.  Move in 1 direction. It will be white when it rolls on, but it will dry clear. ,, Your surface is ready to use.  Apply new coats of sealer every 3 to 4 years.	Assess the current state of your concrete. Go to any hardware store that has a large paint section. Bring home a sample of the color you would like to test out. Measure the square footage of your concrete section.  , Buy enough concrete stain and sealant to cover your concrete. Wash the surface of your concrete with water and a heavy duty cleaner. If you have grease or oil stains, find a product that is specially formulated to remove them before you wash. Spray the area with a high pressure spray nozzle until there are no more soap bubbles. Put on clean, dry shoes once you wash the concrete. Throw plastic drop cloths over decks, stairs, flowers, grass and other pathways. Rent a paint sprayer, if you do not own 1. Wait to apply the stain when there is partial or full shade. Spray the concrete with water, using your garden hose and spray nozzle. Spray the cement with the stain using the paint sprayer. Allow your first coat of stain to dry according to package directions. Decide if you want to do another coat to achieve a more vibrant color. Pour some stain into a plastic spray bottle. Dab the sprayed stain with a wet paper towel to incorporate the hand-sprayed section.  , Wait 24 hours after your last coat before sealing it. Apply the sealer with a 3/8-inch-nap paint roller. Roll a coat of sealer onto the surface. Wait 2 hours.  , Apply a second coat of sealer perpendicular to the first.  , Allow it to dry. Wash the surface of the cement every year with a heavy duty cleaner.
Your car comes with a jack so you can change one tire at a time, but you'll need to have the entire car off the ground to rotate your tires. The easiest and cheapest way to do this is to get a set of jack stands, which run somewhere around $30. DO NOT try to do this with multiple jacks.          If you don't want to buy jack stands, you can use large wood blocks. Do not use cinder blocks because they can break, risking injury to you and damage to your vehicle.; , Reduce the risk of the vehicle tipping when in the air by working on a flat surface. Engage the parking brake before you start the job, and block the wheels you haven't jacked to keep the car from rolling forward or back while you work.          If your driveway is on an incline, or if you don't have a driveway, this won't take much time and you can to complete this project in the empty corner of a big box-store parking lot.  While your car is still on the ground, use a flathead screwdriver and remove the hubcaps so the lug nuts are exposed. Then, with the lug wrench, loosen the lug nuts holding the tire to the axle. DO NOT remove the nuts, just loosen them slightly to make removing them easier when the car is in the air.          Upturn one of the hubcaps to use as a bowl. Place all of your lug nuts in this bowl so you don't lose or misplace any.  Use your jack to raise each corner of the car and then install the jack stand. Consult your owner's manual to determine the proper placement of the jack.          Using four jack stands would be the easiest and quickest way to complete the job, but some people get rightly nervous having the entire weight of the car in the air.If you only have two jack stands, you'll have to raise and lower the car a few times with your jack, since the procedure calls for you to switch the front tires with the back tires. Either way, planning the pattern of the rotation is a smart idea before starting to remove any tires.  Directional tires have tread that goes one way, usually with grooves designed to channel water and road-grit outward to improve handling. For this reason, you can't switch driver's-side directional tires to the passenger's side, and vice versa. Non-directional tires all look the same and can be safely switched between the passenger and driver side.          For directional tires, rotating the tires means you'll need to switch the front driver's side tire with the rear driver's side, and the front passenger's side tire with the rear passenger's side tire. For non-directional tires, the usual rotation pattern is to rotate the front driver's side tire to the rear passenger's side. The front passenger's side gets the rear driver's side tire, and both rear tires move straight up the car. This pattern ensures that you'll get a complete rotation of the tires after two rotations, ensuring the longest possible tire life.  Roll the tire to the new location. Keep track of the lug nuts by keeping them close to the axle from which they were removed. The threads should be uniform, but generally you'll keep them with their location on the car, not the tire.  If you've got the entire car off the ground, just move the tires to their new locations, place them on the studs, and hand-tighten the lug nuts.          If you've only got two jack stands, and you've got them both occupied with the back of the car, say, then you'll start by removing both rear tires. Then, you'll need to move the rear driver's side tire to the front driver's side location. Jack that spot up with your jack, remove the tire, install the new tire, hand-tighten the lug nuts, and lower the jack. Then move that front tire to the rear passenger's side, etc. Continue moving around the car, rotating the tires in the proper pattern.  With your jack, raise each location up off the jack stand until you can safely remove it, then lower the car. Make sure you've tightened each tire on hand-tight before you do this. You should be able to wobble the tire back and forth.  Most cars have 4 or 5 lug nuts. When the car is lowered completely, tighten the lug nuts with your lug wrench by tightening one nut, plus a quarter-turn, then the nut directly across from it, then back to the nut next to the first, etc.          If you have one, you can now use a torque wrench to finalize tightening lug nuts to spec. For most cars it is somewhere between 80–100 feet (24.4–30.5 m)lbs. For trucks, 90–140 feet (27.4–42.7 m)lbs.  Check the air pressure in your tires and add some air if necessary.	Get some jack stands. Find a level work surface. Remove the hubcaps and loosen the lug nuts. Raise the car in the air. Check the rotation pattern of your tires.Tires are either directional or non-directional. Remove the lug nuts from the first tire you've raised and remove it. Rotate the tires in the correct pattern. Lower the car. Tighten lug nuts using the star pattern. Place hubcaps back on the wheels by replacing the lug nuts.
Your engine bay gets extremely hot while the engine is running, so poking around the engine bay before it has a chance to cool can result in serious burns. Allow the engine to cool for a few hours before opening the hood and looking for evidence of a coolant leak.If the hood still feels warm, the engine inside is likely very hot. If your vehicle has been overheating, it will take even longer for it to cool enough to be safe to touch.  Before starting any automotive project, you should put on the appropriate safety gear. Because you’ll be dealing with coolant that may be leaking, eye protection should be considered mandatory for this project. Gloves are optional, but may protect your hands from scratches or bumps as you work.Always wear eye protection when dealing with coolant leaks, as they may drip or spray under pressure. Glasses or goggles are both acceptable forms of eye protection for this project.  Another common point of failure in coolant systems is the radiator cap. When functioning properly, the radiator cap can release excess pressure that builds up in your coolant system, but over time it can become worn out or stuck. If the radiator cap looks rusty, is corroded or caked in grime, it may be the cause of your coolant issues. Replace your radiator cap simply by unscrewing it and screwing in a replacement.Radiator caps are inexpensive and can usually be purchased at your local auto parts store. Never remove the radiator cap from an engine that is still warm. It could spray hot coolant and burn you.  The water pump in your vehicle pumps the water and coolant mixture through the engine and into the radiator where air flow helps to dissipate the heat. Look for signs that your water pump is leaking or has failed if it is visible in your engine bay. The water pump is belt driven, so inspect the belt for damage that indicates that the water pump pulley has stopped moving and has been rubbing against the belt.Without a properly functioning water pump, your engine will not be able to dissipate the heat it produces as it runs, causing the vehicle to overheat. If the belt powering the water pump is damaged, it will have to be replaced after you put in a new water pump. If you are unsure of where to locate the water pump in your vehicle, refer to its service manual or the website for the auto maker.  Look at the hoses traveling from the radiator and to the engine, then follow them along for as far as you can. If any of the hoses are kinked, that will cause the coolant system to fail to function properly. Cracks may also indicate a leak, but even if it isn’t leaking yet, a cracked coolant hose should be replaced before it begins to leak. Keep an eye out for damage to the hoses or signs of rubbing from the serpentine or accessory belts.If one of the belts has been rubbing on a coolant line, they will both likely need to be replaced. Make sure to install the new ones with enough clearance to avoid rubbing the belt on the hose. Leaks in your coolant can result in puddles beneath your vehicle and overheating.  Replace radiator hoses that are leaking or are otherwise damaged.	Allow the engine to cool. Put on the appropriate safety gear. Check the radiator cap for damage. Visually inspect the water pump if you can. Assess damage to your coolant hoses.
Use all-purpose fertilizer like 10-10-10 in the amount listed on the label. For the best results, switch to a fertilizer high in phosphorous (such as 10-16-10) just before the plant blooms.To apply fertilizer: granular fertilizer can be sprinkled on the soil with or without a spreader. Water-soluble fertilizer should be applied using a sprayer or watering can. For either method, always measure your application based on the fertilizer's instruction label.  Daisies don’t require a set watering schedule; in fact, they prefer the soil to dry out somewhat between waterings. Check the top 4-5 in (10.2-12.7 cm) of soil – if it’s dry, water the daisies deeply from underneath so that their leaves don’t get wet. The best time to do this is in the morning.Daisies don’t need watering in the winter unless the weather is unseasonably dry. If that is the case, water them 1-2 in (2.5-5.1 cm) every other month.  Weeds can attract parasites and starve daisies of nutrients. Make sure to wear gardening gloves and remove weeds by hand or with a short-handled weeding tool regularly. This is especially important when your daisies are still young.For less necessary maintenance of weeds, apply 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) of mulch in mid-to-late spring when the ground warms and dries from winter. Keep a 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) circumference around the plant base free from mulch., Throughout the growing season, prune away any dead leaves and snip the flower heads off whenever their appearance begins to fade. This encourages regrowth.Stop deadheading the daisies near the end of the growing season if you plan to collect the seeds. The end of the growing season will vary based on your location., Trim down your daisies where the stem meets the foliage, approximately 3 in (7.6 cm) above soil level.Wait until the last killing frost. You can find the date range of freezes by looking up your gardening zone online. After trimming down, protect the perennials’ root balls with a layer of mulch. You can use straw, hay or leaves., Dig deeply into the ground about 6-8 in (15.2-20.3 cm) away from the plants’ centers. Loosen the roots by rocking the shovel, and lift the plants gently out of the ground by the root balls. Carefully pull the clump apart and discard the woody centers. Replant wherever desired, each group of daisies 12 in (30.5 cm) away from other plants.Autumn is the preferable time to divide your daisies, however you can divide them in springtime if necessary. When dividing your daisies, place them gently in a temporary container to move them, and replant them right away.  Use a single application of fertilizer just before the new spring growth appears, or as soon as it pushes up through the ground.Side dress with compost or apply no more than 1 pound (0.45 kg) of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet (305 square meters).	Fertilize two weeks after planting and once a month thereafter. Water daisies as needed. Mulch around the daisies and/or hand weed as needed. Deadhead and prune the daisies as needed. Cut down your daisies at the end of the growing season. Divide your daisies when they lack space. Maintain your existing perennials.
Detergent jugs, and milk jugs are all great choices. Large water jugs and juice jugs may also work, as long as they have a handle. Most importantly, make sure that the lid screws on. A cap that you pop on and off will not work for this due to the water pressure., This is especially important if you are recycling a detergent bottle. The easiest way to clean the bottle is to fill it partway with water, close the cap tightly, shake it, then pour the water out. When you are done, remove the label and any glue residue left behind., Keep the cap on the bottle. Use a nail to punch holes into the lid. You can also use a needle or thumbtack instead. Punch as many holes as you want.  If the cap is too hard to piece, heat the nail over a flame first. Hold the nail with a pair of pliers so that you don't scorch your fingers.If your bottle had a thick lid (ie: detergent bottle), use a drill and a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) drill bit instead., Do this with a drill and a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) drill bit. This will help make the water flow smoother and help release pressure., Unscrew the cap, then fill the bottle with water from the sink or hose. Close the cap when you are done. How much you fill it depends on how much weight you are able to carry; the more you fill it, the heavier it will become.  If you used a drill bit, you will need to rinse the bottle out first to get rid of any plastic dust.  Make sure that the cap is on tightly. Use the handle to carry the jug over to your plant. Use your other hand to hold the jug by the bottom and tilt the cap downward.	Choose a large bottle with a handle and a screw-on lid. Clean out the bottle and remove any labels. Punch holes into the cap with a nail. Consider adding a hole above the handle. Fill the bottle with water. Use the watering can.
The way you hold the neck of the guitar effects how long you can barre chords before your hand cramps and hurts. Anchor your thumb close the center-back of the neck and not over-the-top as if it was peeking from the fretboard. Placing your thumb in the center-back of the guitar's neck should help you with the proper form. The proper form will increase your hand’s stamina.Look at the angle of your arm and wrists. You will notice that the more acute the angle of your wrist, the less strength you have in that hand. Keep all your joints from your wrist to your fingers at natural rounded angles. There isn’t a golden rule with hand placement. Jimi Hendrix held his guitar in a way that his thumb wrapped around the guitar. Do whatever makes you comfortable. In this example, you’d hold the guitar like a tennis racket.  The proper finger placement helps your sound and your hand's stamina. Place your fingers close to the fret that is closest to the bridge, instead of placing your finger dead-center between the frets. This helps decrease the force needed to barre chords.   You should also get into the habit of arching each finger when playing notes or chords. This way your fingers don't touch other strings and hinder the sound., It is common to feel stressed and strained while playing the guitar. This is especially true for beginner guitarist. It is normal to feel pain when trying out a new guitar shape. When reaching for these tougher hand shapes, it’s important to take note of how the rest of your body is reacting. Make sure you have the proper fingering, then take a deep breath and let your shoulders rest.   Stiffness will only hinder a musician. Keep a relaxed posture to work the instrument into a natural position and feeling., When you are practicing the guitar for longer periods of time, make sure you take breaks. A good guitarist will take productive breaks to ensure the practicing mentality isn’t lost. Take a five minute break to drink water or go on a walk. Avoid sitting on the couch and watching TV on your break.   Maintain your desire to improve as a guitarist. Keep a musical biography around to keep you inspired.	Hold the guitar properly. Have the proper finger placement. Relax your posture. Take productive breaks.
You need to remove all of them, no matter what is said about string tension. Do it by any means but don't destroy your guitar.; , Once all the strings are off, get a microfiber towel (preferably) or a non-lint rag, regular, plain ol' tap water, fine steel wool, sandpaper, a set of screwdrivers, pliers, and tape (only use painter's tape or automotive tape).  It doesn't matter, but in this tutorial we will start with the neck.  Use the screwdrivers and the pliers to snug up all screws and the nut and washers on the peg.  Wipe the neck down, scrubbing inside the frets. You don't need to water a dead tree, get off all excess water, and do not ever use oils or other guitar "care" products.  Tighten all screws and watch you don't mess with your set up. Do not use any guitar "care" products.  They will become dirty and have a terrible sound to them.  This part is time consuming, so you may skip it if you like. Tape off the frets, and use the steel wool to clean each and every fret. Remember that the steel wool will scratch your fretboard, so tape off right at the fret.	Start by taking off the strings. Gather your tools. Start with the neck or body. Make sure all tuning pegs are snug but not tight. Dip a small portion of the towel into the water. Wipe down the body, limiting the water used. Spray contact cleaner in your switches and pots. Clean the frets, if you want. Once your guitar is clean, restring it and play.
A small project can involve making a mini-hothouse using a plastic tub about 2 by 3 feet (61 by 91 cm) in size.   Clean the tub thoroughly and line the bottom of the tub with pebbles to keep water away from the potted plants you will place on top of the pebbles. Fill pots with potting soil and add a few seeds. Sprinkle a little potting soil over the seeds and water lightly. Place plastic wrap over the tub and put it into a sunny spot. Water periodically when the soil becomes dry, but take care not to over-water; just be sure the soil is kept moist. Remove the wrap when the plants are 2 inches (5 cm) in height. Allow the plants to grow uncovered until the weather and conditions are right to transplant them into your regular garden.; ,   Choose a spot that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Be sure you have easy access to water. Find a site protected against prevailing north winds. Purchase a greenhouse or hothouse kit or build one yourself using a frame, glass, Plexiglas or plastic film. You can find plans online or in how-to magazines or books. Determine the floor you want. It could be concrete, dirt or gravel, for example. Concrete or brick will help hold the heat, but could cause mold and bacteria to grow because they also retain moisture. Gravel will allow for good drainage, but will not be as warm.    If you are depending upon solar heat, provide a way to vent air should it become too hot. Louvered windows or flaps you can raise or lower will provide ventilation. Consider using a shade cloth to keep temperatures down during very hot days. You may choose to install a heating system to keep temperatures constant. Your hothouse may need to have access to electricity. Attaching your hothouse to your home will let you heat it using your home heating system. Keep the temperature at about 80 degrees F (27 degrees C). Anything hotter or colder will not allow optimum growth. Keep air fresh by allowing for ventilation. Don't make your hothouse airtight. Keep humidity levels up by using a misting system or by using tubs of water in the hothouse to add moisture to the air.    Tomatoes and cucumbers will need feeding each time you water. Other plants may need less. Check with a local professional gardener or online to learn about recommended watering and feeding levels for the types of plants you are growing.    Plan your year's vegetable crops before placing your order so your hothouse garden will be well thought-out. If you choose to transplant seedlings outdoors, do so according to your climate zone.    Check on the progress of your vegetables, make adjustments to the amount of heat, ventilation, and light. Take care of daily routines such as watering and fertilizing. You can stop small problems from becoming crop failures by catching plant illness, infestations, and other problems early, before they've done irreparable damage to your plants.	Make a mini-hothouse to get a head start on your garden. Decide on the materials and location for your larger hothouse. Decide how your hothouse will be heated. Water and fertilize as needed according to the types of plants you are growing and what they require to thrive. Order or purchase seeds from a reputable garden center. Walk through your greenhouse or hothouse daily.
Feed a length of all-purpose thread through the eye of a sewing needle. Double up the thread, then knot the end using a standard overhand knot.   The length of the thread will vary based on individual preference. Keep in mind that the finished length of your bead chain on the hair clip will be half the total length of the stand itself. Double up the thread, keeping it bent over the eye of the needle, and knot both ends together at the opposite end. Trim away any excess thread beyond the knot.  Thread seed beads onto the strand by sliding them over the needle and down the length of the thread.   You'll need to choose seed beads that have a wide enough opening to fit over the sewing needle. The opening must be too small to fit over the knot at the end of your thread, however. Use any color or mix of colors you'd like for this project. You can create patterns or thread the beads randomly. Continue threading beads until nearly the entire length of thread has been covered. Make sure that you leave enough thread at the top of the strand to knot off, though.  Tie a standard overhand knot above the top bead of your strand. Position the knot as close to the top bead as possible, and make sure this knot is large enough to block the beads from falling off.   Trim away any excess thread beyond this top knot. Note that both ends should be knotted at the completion of this step.  Open the clip and slide the beaded strand inside. The center of the bead chain should should be aligned with the fold of the open hair clip.   Snap clips work best for this project since you can fit the strand of beads directly around the bottom snap prong of the clip. Make sure that the ends of the strand extend outward through the front opening of the clip. If desired, you can knot or glue the stand of beads together at the base of the hair clip. Doing so shouldn't be necessary in most cases, however, and the beads should remain firmly in place even without the use of adhesive.  The hair clip should be done and ready to wear. Fit it into your hair so that the ends of the beaded strand hang down.	Double thread the needle. Feed the seed beads onto the needle and thread. Knot the opposite end. Slip the strand into the hair clip. Wear the clip.
Remember, cashew plants grown into trees, so buy your pot keeping this in mind. Place pebbles near the hole with a small net.; , You can buy potting soil or you can make it by mixing garden soil, compost, coir or coconut fiber, limestone, sand and fertilizers.  Make sure the roots are free and firmly placed on the soil. Cover the roots with more soil till the pot is full. Press down with your hands.  Remember this is a plant of the tropics. Never keep it inside air-conditioned rooms. Water often and keep the soil moist, especially in the first few weeks. Fertilize about twice a year (especially during flowering and nut development) with nitrogen,  phosphorus and zinc.  when the fruit turns red, it indicates that the nut is ready. Remove the entire thing or pick it from the ground if it has fallen. Remove the nutshell from the fruit. Send the nut for processing or remove the shell yourself with precautions. The juices from the shell are known to cause irritation in a lot of people. See video below.	Buy a large flower pot. Fill 3/4th of the pot with potting soil. Create a hollow in the potting soil and place your cashew plant on it. keep your pot in a sunny spot. A cashew nut grows in a shell attached beneath a fruit or apple. Enjoy your cashew plant.
Scare him by pretending to go shopping for expensive gifts you want him to buy for you. This is especially effective if your relationship is still new. When you plan dates with your boyfriend, tell him to take you to a fancy restaurant. Act like you aren’t being spoiled but it’s your right to demand expensive dinners., Make him your personal chauffeur for a few hours or a day. Get him to wait for you in the car and not do anything else but be at your beck and call. Just when you know he's about to reach his limit, text or call him and let him know that it was a joke. Don't go overboard and make him resent you.  After a long day of getting him to run around for you, don’t give him a chance to get romantic or close to you. Tell him to take you home so that you can sleep. Once you see that he's annoyed, show him that you are considerate of him.  Cancel plans with your boyfriend and tell him that it's because you have to go out with your friends. Make sure that you don't cancel anything important and that you don't go too far and make him feel alienated.  Pretend to get irritated for the smallest reasons and be bitchy. If he thinks it's PMS affecting you, pretend to pick a fight about how he doesn't understand you and knows nothing about women.   Don't go over the top and make him question your character. Make it clear that you are exaggerating.  Nothing can ever be enough for you. He buys you roses, you want chocolate. He hugs you twice a day, you want him to hug you 3 times a day. He talks to you for 1 hour, you want him for 3. Sarcasm and tone are effective to convey feign displeasure.	Tell him that you’re a princess and deserved to be treated that way. Get him to drive you around. End your time with him abruptly. Go out with your friends. Make a fuss about everything. Always want more.
Dividing plants prevents overcrowding and promotes the maximum amount of blooms. Diving also cleans and rejuvenates old clumps. Dividing mums should be done in the spring when new growth first appears., Lift the plant from the hole once you have cleared it of the dirt. Shake any excess dirt from its roots. Remove any diseased or dead parts of the plant.  Some plants will be able to separated with your fingers, others may need a knife--it depends on the size of your plant. Try not to damage the roots any more than necessary.Using a sharp garden knife will cause the least amount of damage to the roots, as it will be easier to cut them and there will be less hacking involved. Divide the plant in half again if you desire smaller plants.  They should be planted in well-drained, nutrient-rich, loose organic soil.	Divide your plants every three to five years. Dig your plant up, making certain that you are not harming the roots. Divide the clump of roots and plant in half. Replant the newly divided mums as soon as possible.

You can buy an inexpensive firm pillow from your local department or home goods store. If you don’t want to purchase a new pillow, you can just use an old one you already own.A firm pillow will work best, since it’ll hold its shape better than a plush one.; , Grab an old dress tie and use it to tie off the pillow to create indentations for the CPAP mask. Tie the pillow tightly two-thirds from one end.A dress tie is more durable and will feel better to lie on than string, twine, or rope. If you don't have a dress tie, try using a soft ribbon or narrow strip of fabric.  You’d normally place a pillow on the bed horizontally, or so the longer sides face the head and foot of the bed. Instead, place the pillow vertically, so the shorter sides face the bed’s head and foot. The end of the pillow with the tie one-third down from its edge should face the foot of the bed.Try lying down on your side on the one-third section of the pillow. The tie should create spaces that comfortably fit your CPAP mask. If necessary, adjust the tie’s location to find the most comfortable position.	Purchase a firm pillow. Tie it two-thirds down from one end. Place it on the bed vertically instead of horizontally.
Use a Mohs hardness pick to determine the degree of mineral hardness. Determining whether the concrete is soft, medium, or hard will allow you to fine-tune the polishing process.   Use the tools supplied in the kit to test the hardness of the concrete against the hardness of other minerals. The softest mineral that is capable of scraping the concrete is harder than the concrete, placing the concrete's level of hardness directly below that mineral.; , Prepare a solution of warm water and household detergent, then scrub the concrete thoroughly using that solution and a bristle brush. Rinse away any suds and let the area dry.For especially stubborn stains or mold, you might need to use a stronger cleanser. Hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and TSP are common options, but do not mix these chemicals together. Choose and use only one chemical. Wear protective gloves and eye goggles before handling any chemicals. Keep the area well-ventilated, too.  If there are any cracks in your concrete surface, you should repair them before you polish it.Purchase specialized concrete crack filler. Follow the instructions on the package to mix the filler, then squeeze it directly into the crack. Allow the filler to set completely before moving onto the next step.  You'll need to use a specialized tool to grind concrete; a standard sander will not be enough. You can usually rent concrete grinders from most hardware stores.   Before agreeing to rent the grinder, make sure that it feels comfortable enough for you to use. Note that renting a grinder can cost as much as $1000 per week, so this project may not be especially cost-effective if you're only working with a small concrete surface.  Before handling the grinder, you should prepare yourself by wearing a dust mask, gloves, safety goggles, and ear plugs.While not strictly necessary, you may also want to wear a helmet to protect your head in the event of an accident. This is especially important if you are working in an area currently undergoing other construction. Wear work shoes with a good grip, too. Even if you feel fairly confident about your home improvement skills, accidents happen, and no-slip shoes can help prevent accidents caused by sliding, slipping, or falling over.  If you need to remove sealer, stain, or other contaminants that wouldn't wash off, start with a 40-grit grinding disc. If you do not need to remove anything, though, skip directly to an 80-grit disc.   Note that these discs must be metal-bonded diamond discs. Non-diamond discs will not be hard enough to grind down the concrete. Keep in mind that lower grit values indicate coarser discs. In other words, 40-grit discs are coarser than 80-grit discs. Follow the instructions that come with your grinder to determine the proper way to attach discs and power the machine. Pass over the entire concrete surface, gradually working from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner.  You will need to use at least two or three more grinding discs. Choose discs that are progressively higher (less coarse) in grit-size.The exact grit sizes may vary depending on the hardness of your concrete. As a general guideline, however, follow the 40-grit disc with an 80-grit disc. Move onto 150-grit after that, followed by 200-grit, and possibly 400-grit. Pass over the entire surface with each new disc. For each new disc level, the idea is to buff away any scratches made from the previous grinding disc. Accomplish this task by crossing over scratch lines in a perpendicular direction.  Spray liquid chemical hardener over the surface to help solidify the concrete.The best time to densify the concrete will vary depending on the original degree of hardness. Return to the results of the Mohs hardness test. For soft to medium concrete, apply the densifier after using the 80-grit disc. For medium to hard concrete, apply the densifier after using the 200-grit disc. Follow the manufacturer's instructions when determining how to apply the densifier. Typically, you'll need to pour the product into a small sprayer. Use the nozzle of the sprayer to coat the entire concrete surface, then let it dry before continuing.  After your primary grinding and densifying, attach a 3000-grit disc to the grinder. Work over the entire concrete surface with this disc, moving from one corner to the diagonally opposite one.   This grit on this disc is so fine that it will actually begin polishing the surface. You can skip this step if absolutely necessary, but following it will give the finished concrete a high-gloss appearance.  Grinding the concrete produces plenty of dust and debris. After you finish all of the grinding, you should vacuum as much debris as possible using a shop vac.   Note that some concrete grinders come with their own vacuum. In these instances, use that vacuum instead of a separate shop vac. You can also vacuum the surface in between disc switches, but doing so is not typically necessary. One thorough vacuuming before you buff the concrete should suffice.  Remove the grinding disc from your concrete grinder and attach a burnishing pad. Pass over the entire concrete surface using this pad.Working the concrete with the burnishing pad should buff the concrete and make it notably smooth. If you do not have a burnishing pad for your concrete grinder, or if the machine does not have an appropriate setting for use with a burnishing pad, use a low-speed brush-style buffer instead.  Choose a water-based or solvent-based concrete sealer and follow the manufacturer's instructions when applying. Some sealers need to be rolled, while others should be sprayed onto the surface.Sealers protect the concrete against grease, dirt, and other stains. Moreover, using a glossy sealer should give the polished concrete more of a sheen. No matter which type you use, the standard coverage rate is 250 to 300 square feet (23.2 to 27.9 square meters) of concrete per 1 gallon (4 L) of sealer. Apply two thin coats instead of one heavy coat. Wait for two to four hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second, then apply the second coat in a direction lying perpendicular to the first coat. After applying the second coat, wait another two or four hours before moving onto the next step.  Pass over the sealed surface once more with the burnishing pad or buffer. Work slowly and thoroughly, covering the entire surface at an even pace.   Move in the direction lying opposite/perpendicular to the direction in which your applied your last layer of sealer. When you finish this final pass, the concrete should look as smooth and glossy as finished stone.  Allow the final coat of sealer to completely dry before you actively use the concrete surface.   The exact amount of time will vary depending on the manufacturer, but it will usually be between 24 and 72 hours. After you wait the appropriate amount of time, the polished concrete should be finished and ready for active use.	Evaluate the concrete. Clean the surface. Repair any cracks. Acquire a concrete grinder. Wear protective gear. Grind the concrete with the coarsest disc. Progress through several grit sizes. Apply densifier in the middle of the process. Pass over the concrete with 3000-grit. Vacuum any debris. Switch to a burnishing pad. Apply one or two thin coats of concrete sealer. Burnish the surface once more. Wait at least 24 hours before use.
Draw a thin bead of tacky glue down the center of the barrette base.   Alternatively, you can lay a dot a glue directly beneath the estimated position of each stud. You'll need to line up the studs beside the base of the barrette to determine how many you'll use and how far apart to space the glue dots.; , Arrange a line of pyramid-style studs over the barrette, lining them up so that the flat edges face one another. Press the back of each stud firmly into the applied adhesive, making sure it sticks, and use as many studs as needed to cover the full length of the barrette.Check the studs before lining them up. Ideally, the studs should be just a little wider than the width of the barrette. Before arranging the studs, fold out the prongs of each stud so that they lie completely flat. Wipe away any excess glue with a damp paper towel. Allow the glue to dry completely before continuing to the next step.  After the glue dries, use pliers to bend the prongs of each stud around the barrette back.   Make sure that the prongs only bend around the backing and not around the clip portion of the barrette. If the pressure you apply causes the glue to weaken and the stud to break away, reapply the glue as needed. Wipe away any excess glue and let it dry completely before continuing.  Apply one or two coats of white spray primer to the front, back, and sides of the barrette. The studs must be completely coated, as well.   For best results, use a spray primer labeled for use with metal. You'll usually need to wait at least 30 minutes in between coats, but each primer can be a little different, so you should check and follow the label instructions to be sure.  Apply two to three coats of spray paint to the barrette. Choose any color you want and make sure that it covers the entire barrette, including the attached studs.   As with primer, you should use a spray paint approved for use with metal and follow the label instructions carefully. You will usually need to wait 30 minutes or so in between coats. Allow the paint to dry completely before wearing or otherwise handling the barrette. The final wait time can be as much as double the wait time given in between coats.  Once the paint is dry, the barrette is complete and ready to wear.	Apply glue to the barrette base. Line up the studs. Bend the prongs around the barrette. Coat the entire barrette with primer. Spray paint the barrette. Wear the barrette.
Make sure you have friends that love metal. The biggest reason to surround yourself with fellow metalheads is to share your thoughts on metal and learn from them but don’t exclude any of your friends who don’t appreciate or like metal. If they are your friends, you should be able to get along regardless of music preference.  Be sure to not be a jerk. Metal is aggressive, but this doesn't mean you have to act aggressively. Metal music is an expression of human emotions. Metal became so popular because it is an outlet for fans and musicians to channel the darker emotions of life.   All good art channels universal human emotions in a way that reacts with you. Metal certainly can have a moving effect on you, but don’t let that alter the way you treat others., Claiming to be a metalhead does not make you one.You should also realize that metal has almost nothing to do with fashion. It is okay to wear a t-shirt of your favorite band or a leather jacket, but you certainly don’t have to.   Metal is completely about being yourself; there is no model to follow. Be a metalhead out of your love for this music, not for the fame or the attention. Remember: being a metalhead does not mean making all of your conversations based around music., While style doesn’t dictate a metalhead, you can still look good while rocking out. Check online to see if your favorite band has merchandise that you like. The classic metalhead will have a handful of metal band t-shirts. It is similar to the punk aesthetic in this sense.   Wear guitar pick necklaces, or other instrument related things, if you can play the instrument.  There are several aspiring metalheads who get wrapped up in trending dress styles. Stores like Hot Topic can have plenty of gear, but a lot of their merchandise is for fading trends. If you find a t-shirt from a band you like that you think is cool, go ahead and buy it. Avoid spending all your money at a store like this.   Being a metalhead is all about authenticity. You cannot buy your way into a lifestyle. At the end of the day, being a metalhead is about the music and your devotion as a fan.	Be around fellow metalheads. Practice kindness. Respect the metalhead title. Wear metal clothing. Avoid poser trends.
There are various options for creating a sequin egg, and what you choose will depend on what you've got in mind for theme and/or the materials available. Some ideas include:   Color: The easiest way to approach color is to keep it all the same color. Or, you could use two matching colors. A little more complicated but amazing to look at is to make a rainbow colored egg. Pattern: Various pattern approaches include using small and large sequins, stripes, a motif such as a bunny or a letter or a cross.; , Use pencil or marker. If you're adding sequins randomly, simply proceed without adding any design.  Press the sequin against the blown-out egg (or plastic egg) and hold in place briefly to set.  Cover the entire egg.  This simple craft doesn't take a lot of effort before it's ready for display.	Decide how you want the egg to look. If you're using a specific design, draw this onto the egg as a guide. Place a little blob of glue onto the sequin. Continue with the remaining sequins. Done.
Coreopsis flowers can be sown directly in the plant bed during early to mid spring, after the frost has cleared but before the weather gets hot.; , Coreopsis flowers are native to areas with prairies and dry plains, and as a result, the plant thrives in warm, sunny locations. A south-facing spot that receives full sun often works best, but an east- or west-facing spot that receives at least partial sun will work, as well.  Use a garden fork or tiller to dig up and loosen the soil in your plant bed. The soil in the plant bed should be turned about 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 cm) deep.  The compost enriches the quality of the soil, making it nutritional enough for new flowers to grow in.  These plants do not do well if the roots are water-logged, and good draining soil is essential. If your soil is dense and heavy, you may want to mix in 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of garden sand or peat moss, or vermiculite along with the compost.  Do so sparingly, preventing the flowers from growing too closely together to avoid crowding them out.  The soil you use to cover the seeds should be sandy, or otherwise loose. The seeds should not be planted too deep, but a covering of soil is necessary to protect them against the elements and against birds and other predators.  Water the area with a watering can or garden hose every day, except for rainy days, until the seeds germinate and seedlings start to form. This should only take one or two weeks. Do not allow the soil to dry out during this time.  By early summer, the plants should have several sets of leaves. At this point, it is best to space them apart by at least 12 inches (31 cm) to prevent the roots from tangling and competing for resources. You can thin the plants out by either snipping the stem off at soil level or by gently yanking weaker plants out of the ground.   To yank out a weaker seedling, insert a garden trowel about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) into the ground, at a distance of about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) away from the visible stem. Gradually ease the trowel toward the plant until the tip is about even with the center of the stem. Then, slowly and carefully lift the plant out roots out. This method works best when you can guarantee that you will not harm the roots of nearby plants or if you plan to transplant the removed flowers to another location.	Sow the seeds once the ground begins to thaw. Pick a sunny spot in your garden. Turn the soil. Amend the soil with compost.Mix 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of compost into the garden soil using a trowel or shovel. Improve the soil's ability to drain. Sprinkle the seeds over the soil. Cover the seeds with a light coating of soil. Keep the soil moist. Space the plants about 12 inches (31 cm) apart.
They should be 12 inches long and serve as your secondary color.   Use a ruler for an exact measurement. Fold each strip in half lengthwise. Try to be diligent in folding; the opposite side of the duct tape is a different color and will be seen. Repeat this 23 times. That's right, 23. Use a different color on occasion if you see fit.  Put weights on them (books, stacks of paper, boxes) to flatten them out.  Measure out 25 inches (63.5 cm) of your main color.   Fold each strip in half, just like you did with the horizontal strips. Do this 12 times. Cover all straps with weights for around an hour to flatten completely. They'll be easier to work with.  Rip off a piece of duct tape from your main color that's about 14 inches (36 cm) long.   Fold it in half sticky side out and make a crease. Line all 12 of the vertical strips along the crease. Get them up close and personal to each other. Reverse the seam and fold along the crease, adhering the ends together. Do this for both sides.  Make sure each strip is snug in its place.   For weaving, go under, over, under, over for the first strip and then over, under, over under for the second. Repeat. Throw in a different color here and there to mix it up.  This should go on the back of your purse. It acts as a liner.   Be as straight as possible--the strips will create lines. Don't skip this part; the liner makes your bag much sturdier. Continue weaving and constructing the lining as you go until you meet the far seam.  Leave half of the strip hanging, exposed.   Flip the entire piece over and fold the hanging edge over, taping it to the opposite side of the bag. Repeat for both sides.  These will serve as the sides. They should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 8 inches (20 cm) tall.   Fold your strip in half sticky side out. Lay on another strip sticky side up touching the upper, sticky edge of your first piece. Unfold the bottom piece so that the two pieces are totally stuck together. Fold the top sticky part over the middle, so that there is only sticky on the bottom edge. Flip it over and repeat.  If you're lost, we understand. Basically, halfway overlap the pieces of tape, flip it, halfway overlap them again and repeat until it is the size you want.   With the last one, fold it down so you have a sheet with no sticky band at the top or bottom.  You want your sides to be a bit bigger at the bottom than at the top.   Like a triangle...but not quite. The two sides should come to a point if the piece were to go on.  Count 8 strips in for centering.   This will not be centered; one side is supposed to be longer than the other.  This will adhere the sides together.   Fold it in half sticky side out. Connect the sides together. Repeat this three more times.  This hides any pieces that wound up not completely straight.   One side should be longer than the other. It's a flap-top purse; the longer side serves as the cover.  Attach velcro to keep the purse from opening needlessly.  Cut three strips a bit longer than half the length you want the strap to be.   Lay one down, sticky side up. Cover half of it with another strip, sticky side down. Fold one half over the other. Flip the piece and cover the now-exposed sticky edge halfway with the third sticky piece. Flip over again and fold the edge down so there are no exposed edges. Tape the two pieces together and tape them to the inside of the bag.	Make the horizontal strips. Make the vertical strips. Construct the seam. Start weaving. Cover what you've done with your horizontal strips. Add a strip along the longest edge. Make two strips the height of your bag. Trim down the edges. Tape the sides to the inside of your piece. Place a strip along the bottom of the side to the top edge of the purse. Cover all the edges with a strip of your primary color. Make the handle.
Some great fabrics to use would be satin, velvet, nylon, cotton, vinyl, or grosgrain. You can choose whichever material you like best.   Consider how stiff you want your bow to be when picking out the ribbon. If you want your bow to pop-up, use a firmer material like grosgrain or vinyl.; , There are many types of hair clips, ties and headbands available, and ribbon can be attached to almost all of them. All you will need to attach your ribbon to your hair accessory is a hot glue gun or fabric glue.  There are endless styles of bows to pick from, all ranging in level of difficulty. Decide if you want to make a bow that requires glue or stitching before you begin.          While bow making may seem challenging at first, with practice, it will become easier, and you can keep moving on to more challenging bows.	Select the fabric you would like to use for your bow. Decide how you want to fasten the ribbon in your hair. Choose the type of bow you want to make.
Generally speaking, one bottle of DyeMore can dye up to two pounds of fabric.Dyeing very light clothing or very dark clothing will require at least one additional bottle, so be prepared if this is the case for you. Polyester may require a second bottle of DyeMore, because of its synthetic makeup. The darker color you want at the end, the more dye you will need.; , This helps to remove finishes that might inhibit the absorption of the dye. Use warm, soapy water to wash.Use a sink or small tub for smaller items, such as scarves and short-sleeved shirts. Use a larger bucket or tub for bulkier items, such as long-sleeved shirts, jackets, and pants.  You can create different patterns, such as rosettes, sunbursts, swirls, and so forth. Here are some ideas to get you started:  For a simple, crumpled look, crumple your garment into a ball and secure it with a few, large rubber bands. For a banded effect, twist your garment into a rope, then tie some rubber bands around the rope. Keep the rubber bands several inches apart. To create a sunburst or swirl: pinch the center of your garment (such as shirt or handkerchief) and twist it. Keep twisting and turning the fabric until you get a shape like a cinnamon roll. Secure the garment by wrapping a few rubber bands around it.  Because of the challenge in dyeing polyester, using a stovetop method is recommended because the dye process needs hotter temperatures in order to work.Once the large pot is filled with 3 gallons (11.36 liters) of water, cover the pot and turn the burner to high. Heat the water to almost boiling. Using a cooking thermometer will be helpful, as the dye process requires a steady temperature of about 180°F (82.3°C). The thermometer will ensure that you keep the water at that temperature.  Shake the bottle of DyeMore before adding it to the pot to make sure that the dye is incorporated. In addition to the bottle of DyeMore, add 1 teaspoon of dish washing liquid and use a large spoon to stir the mixture well.If your fabric is white, and you want to dye it a lighter, pastel color, start with half a bottle of DyeMore. It is easier to add more dye later. If you plan on dyeing your fabric more than one color, pour in your lightest color first. You will need to do a separate dye bath for the other color(s).  This helps you to see if the dye is the shade you would like.If it is too light, then add some more dye to the mixture. You may need to add up to one more bottle. Test the color with a new scrap of white cotton fabric. If the color is too dark, then add more water. Then, test the color again with a new scrap of white cotton fabric. If you decide to add more dye, remember to shake the second bottle before pouring it in.  In order for the color to take fully in the clothing, polyester requires at least this amount of time in the dye bath. Use tongs to lift and move the clothing around in the pot. Wear rubber gloves to do this so that you do not dye your skin.   If you plan on dyeing all of your fabric, dip it all the way into the dye bath. It should be completely submerged. If you plan on dyeing only part of the fabric, then dip it in only part way. Consider draping the rest of the fabric over the edge of the container. Keep the garment in the dye bath even if it has reached your desired color in less than 30 minutes. The color can rinse from the fabric if it is not given enough time to set in the fabric, which will make it lighter than you desired.  Squeeze out excess dye over the pot full of the dye bath. Be sure to keep the rubber gloves on during this time, as the dye will still stain your skin. Remember that as the clothing dries, the shade of the color will lighten.If you wrapped rubber bands around your garment to tie dye it, carefully cut those rubber bands off with a pair of scissors., While you rinse, gradually make the water cooler. Continue to rinse the article of clothing until the water runs clear.If you want to add more colors to your garment, then you can dip it into another dye bath after you rinse it. Be sure to rinse your garment after each dye bath.  This will remove any last remnants of excess dye.  Spread an old towel out on the floor, and align the bottom of your garment with the bottom of the towel. Roll the garment and towel together into a tube. Press down on the towel tube gently and squeeze. Try to get out as much moisture as you can.  If you have a very large, bulky item, you may need to do this step a few more times with a fresh towel. Bulky items soak up more water than lightweight items.  Place the hanger in a place where there is a lot of airflow, such as on a balcony. If this is not possible for you, hang it in the bathroom and turn the fan on. Be sure to place some newspaper or old towels beneath the garment to catch any drips. There is a small change that the garment still have some dye in it.  Use a regular hanger to hang shirts and jackets. Use a pants hanger, or a hanger with clips, to hang pants, shirts, scarves, and handkerchiefs. Avoid draping the fabric over anything while it dries.	Weigh the garment to determine how much dye to use. Wash the garment prior to dyeing. Consider tying the garment up if you want to tie dye. Bring 3 gallons (11.36 liters) of water to boil in a large pot on your stovetop. Pour one bottle of DyeMore into the pot of water once it is simmering. Test the color on a scrap of white cotton fabric. Dip the garment into the dye bath.Stir the garment slowly and continuously in the dye bath for at least 30 minutes. Remove the garment from the dye bath when it reaches your desired color. Rinse the garment under warm water. Wash the garment again in warm, soapy water.Rinse the garment when you are done washing it. Wrap the garment in an old towel to remove excess moisture. Hang the garment to dry.
You want to make sure you behave in accordance to the law when you're pulled over for speeding. This way, your character will look good during trial and you're more likely to successfully avoid a speeding ticket.   Pull over as soon as you see the officer's lights and there is a safe spot to do so. You do not want to pull over in an intersection or anywhere else you might obstruct traffic. However, try not to wait more than 30 seconds to find a safe spot. Immediately put on your hazard lights to show you are respectful of the safety of other drivers on the road.Keep you hands visible as the officer approaches your car, placing both hands on the steering wheel. You do not want the officer to think you are being hostile or reaching for a weapon. When the officer asks for your license and registration, politely explain where these documents are and ask permission to reach for them.Show respect in your actions and words. No matter what happens, you must be polite and submissive. Do what the officer asks of you without arguing or getting defensive.; , If you're being pulled over for speeding, the first thing the officer will ask you is if you know how fast you were going. Be prepared to answer this question in a way that does not further your legal trouble.   When the officer asks you, "Do you know why I stopped you?", answer, "No, I don't." Answering that you were speeding can be taken as an admission of guilt and sabotage your chances of successfully fighting the ticket. If he asks how fast you were going, you do not have to answer the question. You have the right to remain silent. However, if you want to give some answer do not admit guilt here. Do not say, "I was going 62 in a 55 zone," for example. Instead, give a noncommittal answer like, "I'm not really sure." Now is not the time to fight your case. Do not say something like, "I wasn't speeding. I checked my speedometer." If you anger or otherwise frustrate the officer, he will probably remember you and be more likely to have specific memories and notations that can help the prosecution during trial. If the officer asks to search the vehicle, you have the right to refuse. A search warrant is required without probable cause. If the officer says he will get a search warrant, politely tell him to do so and continue to refuse a search.  While the officer is writing your citation, take advantage of this time to survey the scene.   Write down the make, model, license plate and unit number of the officer's car. Take note of your precise location and try to get an approximate sense of where the alleged violation took place. Take note of any weather conditions, such as rainfall or clouds, that could obscure the officer's judgment. Also, pay attention to the traffic conditions and look especially for extenuating circumstances that could have caused inadvertent speeding. If you have any passenger's, take note of their names and make sure they stay silent during the exchange. Write down anything the officer says. Note as many small details as possible. This will help you look like a credible witness in court. Pay attention to your shirt color, any small dents or cracks in your car, and any noticeable physical characteristics of the officer.  Once the officer returns to the car, he will hand you a citation to sign.   Remember, this is not an admission of guilt. It is merely an acknowledgment that you received the citation and understand you're receiving a speeding ticket. Politely ask the officer if he can move the court appearance to the county seat. If he refuses, ask him to note the request. Having the appearance moved closer will make fighting the ticket easier for you. Do not refuse to sign the citation. Once again, it's not an admission of guilt and refusing to sign it will not make you look favorable in the officer's eyes.  Wait for the officer to pull out before you leave the scene and do so in a calm, collected manner. You do not want to appear angry or otherwise confrontational while leaving the scene as anything that makes you more memorable to the officer can result poorly for you during trial.  When it comes to contesting a speeding ticket, you have a variety of options in terms of the route you take.   When you contest a ticket, you must enter a plea. Pleading guilty means you're accepting the ticket and paying the resulting fines, which will raise your insurance premiums. Pleading "No Contest" means you're not contending the charges but not pleading guilty either. This will, however, result in the same consequences as pleading guilty. Pleading "Guilty with explanation" means you admit to speeding but want to the court to take certain circumstances into consideration, which may result in your insurance premiums staying the same. However, the best way to avoid losing money over a speeding ticket is to simply plead "not guilty" and fight the ticket in court. You should only plead "guilty with explanation" if you were speeding due to an emergency.If you plead "not guilty," focus your defense on either challenging the officer's means of measuring your speed or his identification of your automobile. If there were many other cars similar to yours on the road that day, the officer may have pulled you over by mistake.Always check with your insurance before fighting a ticket. You want to see how much a conviction would affect your insurance premiums and whether the raise would be more or less than it would be if you simply accepted responsibility and paid the fine. Remember, only 50% of people who fight traffic tickets get their tickets dismissed.  Once you've entered a plea, it's time to set your court date so you know how long you have to prepare your case.   There are three ways to set your court date. You can appear before a judge and enter a Not Guilty plea as well as a request for a court date. You could go to the County Clerk's office and request a trial date. You could mail a copy of the citation to the courthouse, along with a request for a trial date. You usually have to post bail in the amount of the fine, so check with the court to make sure you have the proper amount and proper payment method. Posting bail means you've already paid your fine, so if you lose your case there will be no additional fees. Your trial will occur within 45 days of the day you enter you plea. As soon as you've entered your plea, begin preparing for trial. You probably do not need a lawyer for a speeding ticket. Lawyers are usually only brought into traffic court to fight violations that could result in jail time like DUI's and driving on a suspended license.  The first step to prepping for your defense is to make a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles. You can get certain records at the DMV that can help you with your case.   You can verify the status of your driving record at the DMV. If you do not have previous traffic violations and have a clean driving record, bringing this kind of evidence to court can help your case. Someone at the DMV should be able to help you print your driving record for a small fee.  You should know your rights as a defendant while going into court. Rights are often glossed over in traffic court to try and speed through the process and get you to pay the ticket. Review your rights before the trial begins.   You have the right to a court trial with a judge. A jury will usually not be called in for traffic court. You do have a right to an attorney but, as previously discussed, this is probably not necessary when fighting a speeding ticket. You have the right to subpoena witnesses or documents. This is an important right to be aware of. If there's anyone who can verify you were not speeding, call them in to testify. Do not call the officer who pulled you over to testify, however, as he will want to see you pay the fine to keep his reputation intact. You have the right to cross-examine anyone who testifies against you, which usually means the officer who wrote the citation. You have the right to remain silent. In other words, you do not have to testify against yourself. You should probably avoid testifying against yourself while fighting a speeding ticket as it is unnecessary and could make you look bad.  While you wait for your trial, you should begin gathering evidence to support your case.   Go back to the scene of the citation. You should sketch a diagram of the scene that includes all roads, making the width of lanes, traffic controls like lights and signs, the location of your vehicle and the officer's vehicle when you were pulled over, any buildings, power lines, foliage, fences, or other notable features of the area. Submit a request for certain public records. You should review the actual vehicle code in the area where you were allegedly speeding to make sure the officer pulled you over for the correct violation. You can submit a discovery subpoena to the court to get certain documents that may help your case. You should get documents on the radar device used to determine your speed to check for any malfunctions or recent repairs. You should get a record on the police officer to look for any previous cases he's won or lost in traffic court. You should also get some information on the patrol car regarding any recent repairs or damages to the car.  If you have time, visit the court and watch the judge oversee a few cases. You want to see how the judge interacts with defendants to get a feel for his personality. You also want to see what his relationship is with the prosecutor and the testifying officer. This should give you a sense of how intense your trial will be.  Reviewing all the information you've gathered, pick a line of defense you feel will be most likely to help you win your case.   A lack of prosecution witness is an easy way to get a ticket dismissed. If the officer does not show, which happens sometimes, you will be found not guilty. Be prepared to use this as your defense if the officer is not present on your court date. If the prosecution fails to prove the case against you, you will be found not guilty. Knowing the code well, and having good witnesses and diagrams of the crime scene, can help you win your case this way. Technicalities can also help you get your ticket dismissed. If the officer was in the wrong jurisdiction or enforcing the wrong code for the area, for example, the judge would likely rule in your favor. You can also get the ticket dismissed by proving a factual error. For example, you could prove you were driving the proper speed or the radar reading was inaccurate.  When you enter the courtroom, you need to make a good impression on the judge. Choose an appropriate and professional looking outfit. Dress as if you were interviewing for a job. This will make you appear reliable and responsible.  Make sure you know the members of the courtroom on your trial day.   The defendant is you, as you're the person fighting charges. The prosecutor/ADA is the individual or team working on behalf of the state to prove your guilt. The judge is the person overseeing the case, who has final authority on the rulings. He will have a court clerk, who is his assistant. A bailiff will help conduct the ceremony of a trial. The police officer, if he shows up, will be the main witness of the prosecution.  The trial will begin with you stating your case. This is where you present the evidence you've gathered to show the judge why you believe your ticket should be dismissed. This can be a stressful procedure, so be sure to practice your opening statement several times before the trial date.  Once you've presented your defense, the prosecution will make their case against you.   The prosecution will strive to prove you're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. To do so, the prosecutor will usually call up the officer who issued your citation and ask him a series of questions in an attempt to establish his reliability. Take notes during the prosecution so you can prepare your cross-examination. On one side of a sheet of paper, note what was said. On the other side, note your possible comments and questions to raise during cross-examination.  During the cross-examination, you have a chance to ask the witnesses brought by the prosecution a variety of questions. The goal is to undermine their authority and bring about reasonable doubts that you committed the violation.   Ask specifics. Making it appear that the witness does not remember facts correctly casts doubt in the judge's eyes. The details you wrote down earlier in terms of the incident you were pulled over will come in handy here. If the officer, for example, does not remember it was raining and a Tuesday he might not look like a less reliable witness. Ask questions you think might help your case. If, for example, you're trying to prove the officer pulled over the wrong car ask if he remembers that there were two other blue Honda Civics on the highway that morning. If you're trying to prove his radar system was faulty, ask if he was aware at the time of the citation his radar device was 3 weeks overdue for basic maintenance. Remember, you're not making any arguments during cross-examination. You're only asking questions.  Once the judge has heard both sides, he will make a ruling. He will either decide to dismiss the ticket or ask you to pay the fine.   If the judge rules against you, you can appeal the case to a higher court. However, an appeal is not a new trial with new witnesses. An appellate court will only look to see if any legal errors were made and whether these errors affected the final decision in the case.	Follow standard procedures when you're first pulled over. Answer the officer's questions appropriately. Gather information at the scene. Sign the citation. Leave the scene calmly. Learn your options for fighting the ticket. Set your court date. Visit the Department of Motor Vehicles. Review your rights. Gather evidence. Visit the court. Choose your defense. Choose appropriate attire. Familiarize yourself with the different members of court. Present your defense. Listen during the prosecution's case. Cross-examine the prosecution.

You will need two different colors, one of the outside of the hat and one for the inside. Consider using cotton for one side and canvas or denim for the other.; , You will need to cut one circle out of each fabric. This will be the top of the hat.You will be using ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances. If you have a very small head, you might want to cut a smaller circle. If you have a bigger head, you'll need to cut a bigger circle.  You will need two 12 by 3-inch (30.48 by 7.62-centimeter) rectangles for each fabric. You should have four rectangles total.If you want a taller hat, make the rectangles 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide instead. If you cut a bigger/smaller circle, then cut each rectangle so that it measures half of the circumference.  You will need four identical pieces total, two from each fabric. The pieces need to be 3½ inches (8.89 centimeters) wide. They need to be 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long along the inner curve and 18 inches (45.72 centimeters) long around the outer curve.If you want a wider brim, cut the arches 4½ inches (11.43 centimeters) wide instead. If you cut a bigger/smaller circle, match the inner curve of the brim to the length of your adjusted rectangle.  If your fabric is thin, you might want to add interfacing. Cut the interfacing ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) smaller than your pieces, then iron them to the wrong side of the fabric. You only need to do this for the inner or the outer fabric pieces, not both. , Pin the two outer rectangles together, right sides touching. Sew up both of the narrow ends using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Pin the two outer brim pieces together, right sides facing in. Sew along just the narrow, straight ends. Use a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Place one of the body pieces on the ironing board with the seam facing you. Use your iron to spread apart the seam. Press the seam open and flat. Repeat this step for all of the seams on all of the body and brim pieces.  Pin the top edge of the outer body piece to the outer edge of the matching circle. Make sure that the wrong sides are facing out. Sew around the edge using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Pin the inner edge of the matching brim all around the bottom edge of the body piece. Make sue that the wrong sides are facing out, then sew using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Turn one hat right side out; leave the other one as it is. Tuck the first hat into the second one so that the right sides are pressed together and the wrong sides are facing out., Sew using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide gap for turning.Remove the pins as you sew.  Cut a notch every ¾ inch (1.91 centimeter) to the seam around the top of the hat. Cut a notch every inch (2.54 centimeters) to the seam around the outer edge of the brim. The notches need to be just under ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) so that they don't cut into the stitching.You don't need to cut notches into the seam between the body and brim pieces.  Shape the hat so that one piece is tucked into the other. If you need to, use a skewer or knitting needle to help push out the seams along the brim.  Tuck the edges of the gap in by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) so that they match up with the rest of the brim. Press the brim flat with an iron when you are done., Sew ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) away from the outer edge of the brim., You don't have to do this, but it will make your hat look more professional. Simply topstitching around the brim for 4 to 5 more rows. Leave a ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) gap between each row., Again, if you don't have to do this, but it'll give you hair a nice touch. Topstitch around the top edge of the body part, ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the seam. Next, topstitch around the bottom edge of the body part, also ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the seam.	Choose your fabric. Cut two 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) circles. Cut the body pieces. Cut the brim pieces. Consider cutting some fusible interfacing. Pin and sew the rectangles together. Pin and sew the brim pieces together. Press the seams open on the body and brim pieces. Pin and sew the body pieces to the circles. Pin and sew the brim to the body. Tuck one hat into the other. Pin and sew around the outer edge of the brim. Cut notches into the seams to reduce bulk. Turn the hat inside out through the gap. Tuck and press the gap shut. Topstitch around the outer edge of the brim. Add more rows of topstitching to the brim. Topstitch the top and body of the hat, if desired.
There are several companies that compile and sell vehicle history reports. A vehicle history report is a comprehensive history that includes data on a vehicle’s manufacture, sales, and sometimes repair information. Try websites like:   Carfax Autocheck, After submitting your VIN, the third-party website may prompt you to pay a fee for a complete vehicle history report. While you may not want to pay, it is standard for companies to charge for this service.   Feel free to shop around. Different websites or companies may offer different prices. In addition, some companies may run promos on vehicle history reports at different times. Fees normally range from between $20 to $40 dollars to receive a full vehicle history report. Some websites may provide cheaper rates per report if you want several vehicle history reports. For example, you may be able to get 5 reports for $59.99., Once you get your report back, you’ll need to take a good look at it so you can get a good idea of the car’s history, options, and other information. When reading the report:   Verify the report matches the VIN you submitted. Read about the car's production and the vehicle's repair and registration history in the report. Look to see if the vehicle has been repaired or if the report shows any evidence of aftermarket upgrades.	Submit your VIN to a third-party website. Pay a fee. Examine the report.
If you cannot see out the back of the vehicle, you will need to use your side mirrors to see as you back up. Before you begin, adjust your side mirrors to ensure you can see the side of the vehicle, the ground, and anything coming up from behind you.In many cars you can adjust both mirrors from the driver’s seat, but in some you may need to adjust them manually by hand on each side.  Using mirrors will only show you what is behind your vehicle on either side, so it’s important to check both sides often. This will prevent you from accidentally hitting something, or from not noticing as someone approaches from one side or the other.You likely will need to drive even slower in reverse when using mirrors to be sure you don’t miss anything. It may help to pay closer attention to the mirror on a side with an obstacle, so you can keep your eyes on it.  If you are backing up using only your mirrors in a difficult area, you may choose to ask a friend to guide you. Using your mirrors to keep an eye on a friend that is checking your clearances from the back may be your best option when driving a box truck or something else with severely limited visibility.Have your friend stand behind the vehicle on one side to ensure you can see them as they guide you. Make sure to open your windows and turn off the radio to hear your friend’s instructions as you back up.	Check your mirrors before you begin. Check each mirror frequently. Enlist the help of a friend.
Driving a forklift is nothing like driving a car. Forklifts are steered by their rear wheels, have unwieldy weight distribution, and often have counter-intuitive controls. Depending on where you operate, you may need a license or specialized training.; , Look around the vehicle for any damage or malfunction that might prevent the forklift from operating as it is intended. Pay special attention to hydraulic mechanisms and tire conditions. This is very important!  , This can be done by reading the operator’s manual. ,,,, Move it through basic operations. There will be knobs and levers that move the forks up and down, steer the vehicle and control the speed.  Try lifting empty pallets or bags of sand to get used to the controls. Once you are comfortable, you can begin your intended chore.	Practice. Complete the pre-operations checklist. Familiarize yourself with all controls and meter readings. Note the size and shape of what you are lifting.  , Make sure the fork you are using is set to the proper width.  , Lift an object only to the height needed to move it, so as to balance the weight.  , Observe your working environment, make sure it’s clean and clear of obstacles.  , Start the forklift using the key and start button. Practice driving the forklift in an open area.
This plant grows well in zones 3 through 10. It is a reliable grower and has colorful blooms that usually last into fall. These plants are also great for attracting butterflies. Best of all, this plant is often the first to emerge in spring.   Varieties of this flower that bloom in the fall are perfect for attracting monarch butterflies and other migrating species of butterfly., This plant does well in zones 3 through 8. Although it does not bloom, its leaves offer silver and purple tones that look enchanting in the shade. This plant is a great way of filling out your garden and adding ground cover to it.Although a fern, this plant isn’t very aggressive or invasive. It’s just the thing if you want a tidy and orderly garden., This perennial is drought-resistant, making it a great choice if you have a busy schedule or have difficulty maintaining a regular watering schedule. It grows well in zones 5 through 11. The blooms are relatively tall, making this an excellent plant to use behind plants that grow lower to the ground.   The flowers of this plant will be an open invitation to hummingbirds and butterflies for the duration of the summer. At the end of its growing season, agastache develops seeds at the head of the plant. These often attract birds. Agastache comes in many different colors. You can buy varieties that come in orange, pink, red, purple, and blue., Although it has “weed” in its name, the brightly colored blooms of this plant, usually yellow or orange, will look right at home with other flowering perennials. It grows well in zones 3 to 9, and is ideal for a sunny spot in your garden.The first year butterfly weed is planted, it’s often stunted. This is completely normal. The following year, expect a much fuller plant. This plant is also resistant to drought. If your watering schedule is irregular or you leave home frequently for business, you won’t have to worry about this plant. As you might have suspected from its name, many species of butterflies love to visit this plant., This plant comes in annual and perennial versions. Two common perennial strains are referred to colloquially as “Moonbeam” and “Zagreb.” It flourishes in zones 3 through 9, does well in direct sunlight, and can survive dry conditions.   Traditionally, this plant offers blooms in shades of yellow. More recently, growers have come up with more colorful options. Look for this plant in orange, pink, and red in addition to yellow.	Enjoy early blooms with sedum. Add colorful leaves with a Japanese painted fern. Withstand dry conditions with agastache. Invite butterflies to your garden with butterfly weed. Minimize gardening responsibilities with coreopsis.
Those first ten or so minutes after it starts to rain can be the most dangerous. This is because when rain first begins to fall, it stirs up oil and other substances that have dried on the road. The mixture or oil and water forms a film on the road that makes it extra slippery.   During those first few minutes, drive more slowly and be on high alert for other drivers skidding. Heavy downpour over an extended period of time will eventually wash the roads clean, so conditions might be a little less dangerous at that point.; , The faster you’re going, the harder it is for your car to maintain traction in wet conditions. If your tires connect with a puddle of standing water, instead of maintaining contact with the road, they'll be more likely to skid. That's why it's important to slow down in wet conditions, even if visibility is fine.   It’s fine to go under the speed limit if the roads are wet. Don't go slower than the flow of traffic, but don't feel you have to go 70 mph (110 km/h) on the highway during a downpour. It’s especially important to go slowly if you see standing water.  These are the spots where you’ll be most likely to hydroplane, since your tires will have difficulty maintaining traction. They aren't always easy to see, so be extra cautious (and drive a little slower) when enough rain has fallen to start collecting in puddles.   Puddles are most likely to form along the sides of the road, so try to stay in the center of the lane.Try to drive in the tire tracks left by the cars in front of you. This decreases the chance that water will build up in front of your tires and cause you to lose control of your car. Make sure your windshield wipers are working properly. Poor visibility during rainfall leads to more accidents in part because it's difficult to see puddles through a wet windshield.  If you're driving on the highway and using cruise control, turn it off when it starts to rain. You’ll be more in tune with the conditions around you when it’s off. You may need to reduce your speed quickly, and that's easier to do when your foot is already on the brake and you're paying careful attention to the road conditions and your speed.  This enables you to maintain traction more easily and will prevent you from going too fast.While it's not necessarily possible to do if you're on a highway, if you're on a road with a lower speed limit driving in a lower gear can help you safely take treacherous turns or drive down hills without hydroplaning.  If you have to brake, do so in gentle pumps; if your car has anti-lock brakes, then you can brake normally. Make sure that you don't lock the wheels, which will throw your car into a skid.   Avoid sudden acceleration and braking. Don't make sudden turns, as these could throw your car off-course. Be extra cautious on curvy roads, taking care to steer smoothly and to drive slowly.  When you hydroplane, so much water has built up in your tires that they lose contact with the road. Your car will behave differently depending on how you've been driving and which tires are hydroplaning.   If your vehicle has been driving straight, it will most likely feel loose and begin veering in either direction. If the drive wheels hydroplane, there might be an increase in your speedometer and engine RPM (revolutions per minute) as your tires begin to spin. If the front wheels hydroplane, the car will start to slip towards the outside of the bend. If the back wheels hydroplane, the car's rear end will begin to veer sideways into a skid. If all four wheels hydroplane, the car will slide forward in a straight line, as though it were a large sled.  When you first start to skid, it can be panic-inducing. The car feels out of control and your impulse might be to do something rash. Try not to panic or lose your concentration. You just have to wait for the skid to stop, and stay alert so you can regain control of the car. No matter how your car reacts to hydroplaning, you can take the same steps to regain control.   Bear in mind that most hydroplane-related skids last for just a split second before your car regains traction. Waiting it out is the best way to handle the situation. Don’t slam on the brakes or yank the steering wheel, since these actions will cause you to further lose control of the vehicle.  Accelerating into a skid can cause you to lose control of the car and make matters worse. Don’t try to accelerate out of the skid; instead, slowly ease up, and wait a moment or to until you regain control before you accelerate again.   If you were braking when you entered the skid, ease up on the brake until it's over. If you’re driving a manual transmission car, disengage the clutch as well., Maintain a firm grip and carefully point the car in the right direction. This technique is known as "steering into the skid," and it's the best way to get your car back on track after skidding. You may need to correct the car’s course a few times with light counter-steering as you’re regaining traction.   Don’t turn too sharply or you’ll overcorrect. Jerking the wheel back and forth could cause the car to spin out of control. Keep a steady hand on the wheel and steer with small movements to correct your course.  Never slam on your brakes when you're hydroplaning, since it will make your car do unpredictable things. If you can wait until the skid is over to brake, that's ideal. If you need to break during the skid, pump your brakes gently until you regain contact with the road.   If you have anti-lock brakes, brake normally, since your car’s automated brakes will do the pumping for you.  Tires that are bald or have inadequate tread are unable to maintain good traction with the road, especially in slippery conditions.Having balding tires makes you much more prone to hydroplaning (as well as other tire-related problems like skidding on ice and getting flats). No matter where you live, you're sure to experience wet conditions every once in a while, so be prepared by making sure your tires are in good condition.   Worn tires are more prone to hydroplaning because they have shallow tread depth. A tire with treads that are worn halfway will hydroplane 3–4 mph (4.8–6.4 km/h) slower than fresh tires.A new tire has a tread depth of around 10/32", and over time this gets worn down. When it reaches 2/32", the tires are considered unsafe to drive on. You can determine whether your tires have enough tread by checking the wear bars. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards require tire manufacturers to make tires with wear bars to indicate how much tread is left. When the tread of the tire is even with the wear bars, it's time for new tires. Try the penny trick to see if you have enough tread.If you can't find the wear bars, stick a penny into the tire's tread with Lincoln's head pointing down. If you can see the top of his head, it's time for new tires. If part of his head is buried in the tread, you can wait to get new tires.  Tire rotation is an important way to save the treads on your tires. The type of car you have as well as your driving style can cause some tires to get worn out faster than others. Switching the tires to different wheels periodically prevents tires from wearing down too much on one side. Take your car to a mechanic or tire center and have the tires checked to see if they need to be rotated.   It's customary to rotate tires every 3,000 miles (4,800 km) or so. If you're not sure if your tires have ever been rotated, there's no harm in getting it done just in case. Front wheel drive vehicles need more frequent tire rotation, since this causes the front tires to wear out differently from the back tires., Underinflated tires can make you more likely to hydroplane, since they have more difficulty maintaining good traction with the road. They can also deflect inwards, which makes the tire center higher and traps water easier. Changes in temperature can cause the pressure in your tires to rise and fall, so it's important to check your tires regularly. Every few months, check the air pressure in your tires to make sure they're properly inflated.   Each car is a little different, so consult the owner's manual to find out exactly how your tires should be inflated. If necessary, inflate your tires according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Be careful during the first few minutes of rainfall. Slow down in wet conditions. Avoid driving through puddles and standing water. Turn off cruise control. Consider driving in a lower gear. Drive slowly and carefully to avoid skids, and maintain a mild pressure on your brake and gas. Understand what's happening when you skid. Stay calm and wait for the skid to stop. Ease your foot off the gas. Steer in the direction you want the car to go. Brake carefully. Make sure your tires have good tread. Rotate tires when necessary. Make sure your tires are inflated properly.
You may want to check out professional or amateur productions on video, but be careful not to get locked into preconceived notions of what a character should or shouldn't look or sound like.; , Be sure you have the talent sufficient to play all the most crucial roles. Don't even think about producing "Fiddler on the Roof" unless you have some men who could carry the load of Tevye. You might get lucky when someone appears from nowhere singing "If I Were a Rich Man" in a beautiful baritone, but don't count on it.  Intelligence is one of the actor's most important qualities. When in doubt, it's better to pick a smart person.  Do not base your casting on how well an auditioner can read aloud. Sometimes poor readers can act circles around good readers. Ask those who have difficulty reading to recite something from memory, even the alphabet, to get a sense of their emotive ability.  From the moment someone walks in, you can tell if they are a contender. Notice their manner of speaking, their body language, their attitude.  For example, you probably don't want to cast someone who is 5'4" to play Romeo to a Juliet who is 6'2". Then again, don't assume that things might not work!  , Quality of roles is better than quantity. It doesn't take much in some places to get an ensemble part, but large/leading roles show that the actor has ability.  Once you put someone in a role, he or she may become very attached to it. Better to delay the process with callbacks than to realize after a week of rehearsal that you've made a mistake.  You may want to select a cast and begin read-throughs before assigning specific roles. That way you can do script analysis and build cast camaraderie in the first few days while determining who fits which part best.  You need to know when he or she is available to rehearse. Also, make sure the actor will be in town during the run of the show!  , It should state what is expected of each cast member and include a tentative rehearsal schedule.	Know the script as well as possible before auditions. Identify a talent pool before even selecting a show. Look for smart people. Acting is not reading. Notice everything about the auditioner. Note physical qualities when casting characters, especially those who work in pairs, or when casting a child role. Look at credits, especially ones with bigger roles!, Take your time casting the show. Delay casting if necessary. Get a schedule from each prospective actor. Have actors sign a contract.

Its lines will serve as the walls of the house. These should be approximately even, but don't worry if they're not quite perfect.  Don’t make them taller than the walls, though, or your finished product will look somewhat unrealistic.  If you don’t see a house starting to emerge in your drawing, refer to the image here and make it look more like that.  Remember, we’re drawing in perspective--so for the door and window(s), add in smaller squares and rectangles inside the initial shapes for better detail.  There shouldn’t be too many, but whatever remains should be easy to get rid of.  Your house can follow whatever color scheme you'd like; if you're in need of inspiration, step outside for a few minutes and look at houses in your neighborhood.	Draw a cube. Draw two overlapping triangles on either side of the cube. Connect the sides of each triangle in order to form your roof. Add a large rectangle for the door, and a couple of squares or rectangles for windows. Outline the image and erase overlapping lines. Color it in and you’re done!
Being a perfectionist in your health goals may end up impeding your progress. If you try to be perfect in your new diet and eating habits, you may end up being so hard on yourself that you give up on the diet entirely. Instead, aim for moderate or small improvements in your diet and try to stick to them.; , You may want to re-evaluate your new diet if it is stopping you from living the kind of life you want to lead. If your new diet is stopping you from attending social events with friends and family, perhaps you should modify your dietary goals so that you can still have a social life., Cancelling a lot of social events with friends and family to get to the gym may be a sign of unhealthy exercise goals. The strength of social connections with friends and family is an important factor in your health. Make sure you aren’t sacrificing a healthy social life to get to the gym, since you need both social ties and an active lifestyle to be healthy., You should not aim to exercise so you can eat more brownies, chips or other junk food. An exercise plan built around compensating for poor eating habits will not make you healthier. Instead, you should focus on a well-rounded, healthy diet and a regular exercise routine., Ask your family doctor for advice on specific health goals that would be healthy for you.In conversation with your doctor, set specific and measurable health goals that are meaningful to you.   Ask your doctor: “I see a lot of people doing the vegetarian diet. Do you think this would work for me?” Inquire: “How much should I exercise each week if I want to lose weight by the summer?” For instance, if you want to be able to swim a certain distance by the summer, use this as a starting point for setting your goals. The goals you set should be specific and you should be able to measure your progress over time.	Aim for moderation rather than perfection. Consider whether your diet is negatively impacting your social life. Check whether you are routinely cancelling social events to exercise. Reflect on whether you view exercise as a form of compensation for poor eating. Get medical help if you are unsure about your health goals.
This is, obviously, the most important part of the outfit. As Rey lives on the harsh desert planet of Jakku, she does not own fancy clothing - it is basic and hardy. Rey's typical everyday outfit - the one we see her wear the most in the movie - consists of:  A grey/tan shirt that reaches to her upper thighs, a little way past her hips. It appears to be a cloth/rough cotton shirt with a v-shaped collar slit and no sleeves, so a long tank top. A pair of grey/tan cropped cargo trousers that cinch around her knees. Some grey/tan bandages or cloth strips that are wrapped around her arms or pulled over her arms. These protect Rey from the harsh heat and any danger she may encounter while scavenging. They are tight and stop right at the end of her wrists, stopping at the top a little under her armpits. A long flowing piece of white fabric that crosses over her shoulders and chest. The fabric is held in place by two brown leather belts that appear to be melded together at the hip. On one side of the bottom belt is a small brown pouch. A leather wrist cuff, and a pair of boots. The boots are actually a pair of Po Zu Piper V Dark Brown Boots, and are available on the Po Zu website. They are quite expensive, however, so any pair of sturdy ankle boots will do fine. Rey's other outfits are her scavenger gear, which makes a short appearance at the start of the movie. This outfit consists of all of the above items, except Rey wears a brown shawl/wrap of resilient fabric over her head and shoulders, along with a little pair of goggles. She also has her Resistance Base outfit, seen at the end of the movie, which is her shirt, arm guards, and pants, with a grey cloth waistcoat.; , Rey has short straight dark brown hair, styled in an interesting unique hairstyle of three small buns in a row down the back of her head. Her fringe is pulled back off her face and there are small wisps of hair floating down her face. If you are going to style your hair this way, there are many video tutorials on YouTube - just make sure to muss it up a little to keep it realistic. The makeup artists apparently tied the buns with brown wool to give them a rustic feel. You may have to tighten them from time to time, so it would be a good idea to utilize that pouch with bobby pins/hair grips and hair ties to tie the wool over., Camera flashes and con lights are very unforgiving and will highlight everything, from no matter how far away, so even simple base makeup is integral. In an Allure interview with the makeup artists for the movie, they stated that Daisy wore:  Tom Ford Traceless Foundation, By Terry Brightening CC Lumi-Serum in Sunny Flash, and M.A.C and Skin Illustrator pigments on her face. A dark brown eyeliner pencil from Bobbi Brown that was 'smudged and smudged', along with Kanebo Sensai 38C mascara, a mascara that is specially designed to last in extreme temperatures and can only be removed with 100F water. Daisy also had sunscreen on and the makeup artists sterilized sand in hot water before smearing it onto her face. Since Rey is obviously quite grimy and tanned, you may want to invest in some tanning lotion and also a makeup tutorial on how to create fake dirt on yourself.  Rey's eyes are a green-brown color, and normal contacts will do just fine., Rey is often seen with a serious-looking bo staff (you can choose a stick instead, or buy a staff online) or a blaster, given to her by Han Solo. The blaster is an easier choice for practicality, but the staff is much more iconic. You can always buy both, of course. She also wields Luke's/Anakin's lightsaber in the last part of the movie. The lightsaber was blue and is available online for cheap prices., For the movie, Daisy had an intense fitness regime and packed on a lot of muscle. This is a completely optional step and is up to you - just remember to whip into shape a while before the con if you're making a costume from scratch. This means that when you measure yourself up you'll be the correct body shape and won't have to worry about gaining/losing weight in between., If anyone wants photos with you, they'll be expecting Rey. Common poses are wielding the lightsaber/staff, firing the blaster, crossing your arms, or even just standing to the side while holding the staff. Look up stills of Rey online to get a good feel for everything, and make sure to do a run-through to check you can move okay in the costume. Your pose can also depend on the character you're posing with!	Get the costume. Style your hair (or wig!). Set your makeup. Buy contacts if you have to. Pick your weapons!, If you really want to take an extra step, work out. Figure out some poses.
If the toilet fails to empty completely, returns some contents to the bowl, or tends to clog after repeated heavy use, it's probably not flushing long enough.  The flush should continue for a second or so after the toilet contents disappear, to carry them over the bends and down, down and away., If it has been adjusted to not allow the tank to fill completely (to within an inch or so of the top of the overflow tube), adjust it up a bit.,  (The former are often added to save water, but not using enough water can require multiple flushes, cleaning, and general disgust and inefficiency - which you don't want to lead to the latter.),  A toilet flapper with a foam float halfway down is a simple, inexpensive, fairly effective way to make a low-flush toilet: the foam float on the chain, instead of a little cup under the flapper itself, holds the flapper up and open only long enough for the bottom half or so of the tank contents to flush it, with the weight of the top half on it to increase speed and power.  But, if the float is too high on the chain, the flush will cut off too soon to do its job.  Gently nudge the foam float down the chain a half-inch or so at a time until the flush lasts long enough.	Look for signs the flush is too short. Check the fill valve and float. Remove any objects, such as bricks, bottles, and booze, reducing the volume of the toilet tank. Check the float flapper.
One of the telltale signs of laryngitis is hoarseness, which refers to the raspy, strained quality your voice gets when you’ve used it too much.To make your voice sound raspy and gravelly, practice vibrating your vocal chords like you're croaking like a frog.Also practice making bah noises like you're a sheep, because this will also vibrate your vocal chords. After practicing making sounds, start incorporating that same raspy quality into your speaking voice.; , Another common thing that happens when you have laryngitis is that you'll experience unintentional changes in the volume and pitch of your voice as you speak.When you're speaking, try to make your voice crack as you say certain words, and then make your voice fade out briefly so it’s quieter than usual. Alternate between doing this and speaking in your regular (but hoarse) voice.  In addition to the voice cracking and fading, you should also whisper more when you speak if you want to fake losing your voice. When you have laryngitis, your vocal chords will often have trouble producing sound, and you can replicate this by dropping your voice to a strained whisper intermittently as you speak.   Make sure you continue alternating between your voice cracking, fading, whispering, and speaking hoarsely at a normal volume. When you transition between these different voice effects, try to make the transition as natural as possible so people don’t know you're forcing it.  Laryngitis often causes a rawness in the throat and a dry throat, so it’s common for people who’ve lost their voice to cough sometimes when they speak.Don’t cough too much, but throw in a few dry coughs if you’ve been talking for a while. A cough is created when your body forcefully expels air from the lungs, which is different from vibrating your vocal chords to create speech, meaning you can still cough if you’ve lost your voice., On top of performing different vocal effects to give the impression that you’ve lost your voice, there are also other things you can do to support your act. If you want to lay a foundation for your voice loss, complain of a sore or tickled throat and a cough one or two days prior to losing your voice.  Regardless of what causes laryngitis, the best remedy is always resting your voice.This means that if you really had lost your voice, you'd be trying to rest it so that you could recover quicker.   Try using your body language more, such as nodding or shaking your head, instead of talking when you're communicating with someone.  Laryngitis is often accompanied by a sore throat and coughing, and both these things can make it difficult and painful to speak. In conjunction with talking less and using your body language more, try writing things down to communicate instead of talking.   You can alternate between speaking with voice effects and writing (to rest your voice) to support the impression that you’ve got laryngitis.  Another effective remedy for laryngitis is drinking lots of fluids, particularly water.To support your act, drink lots of water. Especially if you have to talk for an extended period, take small and frequent sips of water.  Soothing lozenges and cough drops are common when people have lost their voice, so you can do the same to support the idea of your laryngitis.	Sound hoarse. Make your voice crack and fade. Throw in some strained whispering when you speak. Cough when you talk. Complain about symptoms in the days leading up to your voice loss. Talk less than you normally would. Write things down to communicate. Drink a lot of water. Suck on throat lozenges.

Begin by visiting http://www.aaa.com. The AAA is actually made up of many organizations, serving different areas. However, you can reach any of these regional organizations by visiting this website.    Note: start with this step even if you plan to apply for membership in person, not online.; , The AAA website may automatically detect the general area you are located in, and send you to the correct web page for your area. If it does not, it will likely display a popup box and prompt you to enter your zip code.   If you do not know your zip code, you may look it up by entering your address at the US Postal Service website.  Some local AAA organizations display their regional address prominently on the front page of their website, which you were just directed to. If you do not see one, or if the address is not nearby, look for a "Find another office" link, or "Find a local branch," or similar. Click this link to be taken to a map or a list of all AAA offices in your region, including their phone numbers and hours of operation.   Try using your browser's Find command and enter "Office" or "Branch." This is typically available with the Ctrl+F key combination in a Windows operating system, or command+F on a Mac.  Optionally, call the listed phone number and ask for information on membership plans. Your local office may or may not be able to register you as a member over the phone. Almost any AAA office should be able to register you in person, as long as you bring your driver's license and a method of payment.   To save time before you show up, know what type of vehicles you operate, and whether other members of your household wish to apply as well.  There are dozens of regional websites, organized in many different layouts. Somewhere on the homepage, however, there should be a button or text link labeled Join Now or Join AAA.  When you click Join, you will likely be taken to a chart comparing the benefits of different membership plans. The details of these vary between regional organizations, but the benefits are typically laid out clearly in a chart.   Usually, the organization offers Classic (or Basic), Plus, and Premier membership. The Plus and Premier memberships cost more, but come with additional perks as described, such as additional free towing, or free travel insurance under certain conditions. If you do not understand a particular perk, the name of the perk may be a link that describes it in more detail. Other AAA websites have a question mark to click next to it, or a "View details" link at the bottom of the chart.  The "Primary Member" price indicates how much you would pay each year for that membership. There is typically an additional "Enrollment" fee or "New Member" fee, which is an additional charge applied once, when you join. Finally, if you wish another member of your household to receive the same benefits, that may cost you an additional "Associate Member" fee each year, per additional member.  The Classic or Basic plan typically only covers ordinary cars, not RVs, trailers, or motorcycles. Your regional organization may display detailed information on this in a Vehicle Types chart at the bottom of the page, or include it somewhere in the perk list.  After selecting "Join" for a particular plan, you should be taken to a form. Enter your full name, personal information, and contact information, as directed. When you're done, hit next.  You may be prompted for additional information, such as associate member information. Look for a "Convenience Billing" option. Select "No" if you do not want your credit card to be automatically billed at the end of each year. Keep it selected "Yes" if you want to automatically renew your membership each year.   If you disable convenience billing, you will need to manually pay your membership dues each year to retain membership benefits.  Enter your credit card information, or your personal checking account information. After confirming the order via email, your membership card should arrive in the mail within a few days.   Do not enter your credit card information over an unsecured internet network, especially a public one used by many people.	Visit the American Automobile Association website. Enter your zip code if prompted. To apply in person, find the address of a local branch. Bring your information to that address, or call ahead and ask for details. To apply online instead, click the Join button or link. Compare plans. Understand the cost. Select a plan that covers your vehicles. Enter your contact information. Decide whether to enable automatic membership renewal. Enter your payment information.
The cucumbers can be spaced 1 foot apart from one another, in rows that are spaced directly beneath the bottom netting bars.  You may need to wind them around a few times before they stay in place.  In doing so, you train your cucumbers to grow upward and naturally climb onto the trellis. After your vines have grow a foot or so in length, they will likely begin the climb the trellis without additional training, but you should monitor their progress throughout the growing season nonetheless.	Plant your cucumbers below the trellis. Once vines form, wrap the tendrils around the bottom of the clothesline. Continue winding the vines around the clothesline as they grow.
If you live near a beach, take a walk and collect some pretty small shells. If you don't have a beach close by, look in craft stores or online for small shell collections. You'll also need a matchbox or two.; ,, The color can match the shells or be in contrast with them.   Don't glue the paper or cloth over the matchbox drawer. You need to be able to access this still. Instead, cut out small pieces of paper or cloth the exact size of the drawer ends and glue at each end separately.  You can add shells to just one surface, or to the top and sides, or all over. You can create a pattern, or simply add the shells randomly.  Glue each shell to the top (and any other part of the box). Leave to dry before gluing shells to additional sides or the base of the box.  These could be beads, costume gems, glitter, lace, ribbon, bows, etc. Decide whether these will form part of the pattern or will be additional decorative elements on top.  It's useful for keeping pins and needles in a sewing basket, paperclips on a desk, earrings/rings, etc. on a dressing table and tacks in the kitchen, etc.	Search for lovely tiny seashells. Peel the striking edges off the sides of the matchbox.  , Cover the matchbox with plain paper or cloth. Design a pattern for adding the shells to the box. Use a glue brush to paint glue over the paper or fabric. If adding other decorative elements, add now. Use the box.
There are a few different options for steel-bound strings. You’ll need to determine which gauge string you use and what type of finish you prefer. The standard size for strings is .11 or .12, but you could go higher for lighter strings or lowers for heavier strings. Decide what type of finish from the following types:          Bronze strings have a clear, ringing, and bright tone, but age quicker. Phosphor bronze strings are warmer and darker than bronze strings. The sound is crisp and lasts a long time due to the phosphor finish. Brass strings have a bright, jangly, and metallic texture. Polymer-coated strings have less sustain and brightness, but are warm sounding and resistant to corrosion. Silk and steel strings are popular among folk guitarist and finger picking players due to their softer touch and delicate tone.; , Lay your guitar on a flat surface, for example on a table, and put yourself in front of your guitar. You could also lay it across your lap or even hold the neck while the body stands upright on the ground.  Begin by removing the deep E or the 6th string which is the thickest string on the guitar. Start unwinding your string by turning the tuning peg to loosen the string. You can figure out which direction to turn the peg by plucking the string and turn it one direction. If it gives off a higher note that means you are tightening the string.          Keep turning the peg until the string falls off the guitar. If the strings are very old then consider just cutting them off with a wire cutter. Remove each string moving from the thickest to thinnest.  Now the string should be hanging from the bridge of the guitar. The bridge is underneath the sound hole where the guitar strings are attached. Depending on what type of bridge your guitar has, you may need to remove the bridge pin. If your guitar doesn’t have bride pins, you should be able to wedge the strings out of their socket.          Pull the pin to remove it. If you can’t wedge it out, use pliers. Bridge pin pullers are available for about $5.00 and are a nice accessory. Pull the string out of the hole., Open the package and uncoil the first string (the thinnest high E string). Look for the string labeled 6th string and uncoil it. Each brand of strings use different legends to help users identify which string is which.  Isolate the lightest string from your new pack. Place it through the bridge's hole that is farthest to the right of the guitar. Begin pulling the string with slight pressure. Thread the new string until the end of the string falls into place. Now place it in the groove on the bridge of the guitar.         If your guitar has bridge pins, you'll need to remove them before inserting the new string. The best way to remove the pins is by using a bridge pin puller. Lodge the tool into the pin and rock it from side to side until the pin becomes loose. Wait until you've fully thread your new string into place before reinserting the pin.  To attach it to the head, begin by lightly pulling the string up the neck. Bring the string an inch above the tuning peg. Wrap the string around the peg twice and insert the string into the hole between the two loops you created.          Begin tightening the string, but don’t tighten the string too much. While tightening the string, use your other hand to stretch the loose string so it holds tune quicker., Take time to do this process to each thicker string. Never fully tighten a string until every string is attached to the guitar. Use a tuner once every string is attached and tune to the following tuning: EADGBE.          Wait a few days to cut the excess string.	Buy a set of strings. Position your guitar. Remove the current strings. Remove the strings from the bridge. Prepare your new strings. Begin stringing. Attach the string to the tuning peg. Repeat for the rest of the strings.
Mark your calendar, or just check the fluids frequently. ,, The oil should be checked after the car cools down for an hour or so, so that oil in the return galleries, cylinder head valleys, etc. is drained down so you don't get a false reading. Locate the oil dipstick (use the owner's manual). Hook a finger through the loop and pull the dipstick all the way out, releasing any clips that might be holding it in place. Use a paper towel or rag to wipe the dipstick clean so that you will have a clear reading. Insert the dipstick into its opening and push it firmly all the way back, as far in as it will go. Pull it out all the way, this time reading the oil level. When you are done, replace the dipstick in its opening.  The dipstick has markings on it indicating a range for acceptable oil level (usually notched, dimpled, or scribed). Double check the markings you see against the owner's manual. If the oil level is too low, appropriate motor oil must be added before the car can be driven. With a new car, take it to the dealer's service or parts department; have them show you how to add oil, and buy the oil and funnel their mechanics use. With an older car, take it to an auto parts store; they will walk to your car, show you where to add oil, and recommend what to buy. Since some engines consume more oil than others, adding oil can also become a frequent task.      Look at the color of your oil, too. Clean engine oil is a clear, golden color. Dirty engine oil is black or brown. If yours is dark, have a look at your car's records to see when the oil was last changed. Darker engine oil can still run a car just fine, so go by the schedule more than by the color. You should also change engine oil according to both mileage and time. Consult your owner's manual for the proper intervals. Even if you don't drive the recommended number of miles, plan to change your oil about once every six months. Just sitting in the driveway, your car's oil can break down and become less effective. Change your oil more frequently than the recommended schedule if your car gets severe use. Repeated, pronounced loss of engine oil can indicate a leak in a gasket or that your car is consuming oil. Keep a watchful eye on your driveway where you park. Also look for signs of oil leaks on the outsides of the engine, and if you see any oil or consistently consume oil, take your car to a mechanic and explain what you have seen. If the oil looks milky or foamy, it may be contaminated with coolant, and should be checked by a mechanic. This condition could indicate a blown head gasket or other serious problems.  This is usually done with the engine running and fully warmed up, either in neutral or park, depending on the make and model. It will be the second of two dipsticks. As with the oil, locate it, pull it out (releasing any clips), wipe it off, push it all the way back in to the bottom of its travel, then pull it out and read the level. Again, look for a level between the two marks on the dipstick.  This transmission fluid is reddish. Transmission fluid does not need to be changed as frequently as oil, but it does occasionally need to be changed. The interval may be as much as 100,000 miles (160,000 km) in newer cars; consult your manual to be sure. If yours looks brown, black, or burnt, or its appearance suggests that it didn't come out of a bottle lately, consider replacing it. Transmission fluid lubricates the transmission, your car's gear system.  Consult your manual for the location, or look around for a plastic reservoir such as this one labeled brake fluid. If your reservoir looks like this one, you can read the level of fluid right through the plastic. Wipe dirt off the outside, if you need to. It might help also to jostle the car gently on its suspension with your hip, hands, or knee, so that the fluid level jiggles a bit. If you still can't see it, take the cap off and look in.  Cars should not consume brake fluid. Low brake fluid can indicate either a leak in the brake line or worn brake surfaces. If your brake fluid is low, have the car checked to find out why. A car with low brake fluid or leaking brake fluid could fail to stop.  This will generally also be a plastic reservoir. Read it through the walls, as you did with the brake fluid, by opening the lid and pouring in more of an appropriate power steering fluid. There may be two pairs of lines, one for a hot engine and one for a cold engine. Read the one that is appropriate to the current condition of your car.  Some cars are now equipped with electronic power steering and will not have a reservoir.  Be sure the engine has cooled down, otherwise scalding water could spray out as you open the reservoir! The coolant will most likely be in a reservoir up front, near the radiator.  Cars are designed to operate with antifreeze as coolant, not water. Antifreeze is a mixture that has a lower freezing point and generally, a higher boiling point than water. If you must replenish your coolant, go buy a bottle of the correct stuff. Read the label on antifreeze. Some formulations are intended to be mixed half and half with water; others should be poured in at full strength. The antifreeze label will tell you which type you have. Sometimes there can be coolant in the reservoir but no coolant in the radiator. If the car is running hot and there is coolant in the reservoir, then you need to remove the radiator hose to check for fluid in the radiator.   Wiper fluid won't affect the performance of your car, but this is what comes out when you use the sprayers to clean your windshield while driving. Washer fluid that's formulated to clean off bugs and other road grime is inexpensive, so it's worth getting the real thing, though topping off with a little water will do in a pinch. There is generally no harm in having low washer fluid. You will naturally use this up as you drive your car and clean the windshield. Simply refill it before it gets completely empty. If you are expecting very cold weather, be sure to use washer fluid that won't freeze in low temperature. Wiper fluid with a low freezing point is specially marked as such.  It's not one of the fluids under the hood, but it is essential to the efficiency and safety of your car. You should check your tires even more often than your engine fluids. While you're there, check the tread on your tires.	Your owner's manual tells you when fluids must be checked, but this is just the minimum to keep your warranty in effect. Park the car on a flat, level surface and set the parking brake. , Open the hood. , Check the motor oil. Check the transmission fluid. Check the brake fluid. Check the power steering fluid. Check the coolant. Check the windshield washer fluid. Check your tire pressure.
Combine 1 ½ cups (355.5 g)  of citric acid, 1 ½ cups (355.5 g) of washing soda, ½ cup (209 g) of baking soda, and ½ cup (130 g) of sea salt in a large bowl or pot. Stir the mixture so all of the ingredients are well combined.If you don’t have sea salt, you can substitute kosher salt.  When the detergent ingredients are fully mixed, carefully transfer it to a jar or other container. Make sure to choose a container with an airtight lid because the borax-free detergent is especially prone to clumping when exposed to high humidity.If you live in an area with high humidity, place 2 tablespoons (30 g) of powdered bentonite clay inside a piece of cheesecloth or pantyhose. Secure the fabric so the clay won’t spill out, and throw the packaged clay into your container of detergent. The clay will absorb the excess moisture so the detergent doesn’t clump.  When you need to wash a load of dishes, place 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the detergent mixture in the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Set the dishwasher as you normally would, and allow the cycle to run.	Mix the citric acid, washing soda, baking soda, and sea salt. Place the mixture in a jar. Use the detergent mixture as you would premade detergent.
Stitch a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam.  If there are problems, these could be the reasons why:   The seam is too short: allow a bit more fabric to show past the foot as you work it through the machine The seam is too large: if you aren't feeding the fabric into the machine carefully enough, it can be helpful to make a guide marker 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the needle. You can do this using a dab of liquid paper or a bit of masking tape. The guide on the machine might be causing the seam allowance to come down too much as you sew; if so, use your own sense of guidance instead.	Check the accuracy of the foot:   Cut two 6 inch (15.2 cm) squares using a rotary cutter. Check this seam against a ruler or tape measure.
You can also paint some white cardstock using red, brown, or orange paint. This will give you a streaked, fur-like texture.   If you can't find cardstock, you can also use construction paper. Cardstock will simply give you more support. If you already have a mask at home that fits you, you can trace it onto the cardstock, cut it out, then skip to the next section.; , Place the paper widthwise across your face, from temple to temple. Gently feel where your eyes are through the paper. Lightly mark the spots on the paper with a pen or pencil, then lift the paper away.  Set the paper down on a flat surface. Draw two almond shapes where your made the eye marks. Next, draw a basic mask shape around the eyes. The mask will cover the forehead, eyes, and part of the nose bridge. It should look a little like a peanut or jellybean.   You can look up a template online, use an existing mask, or freehand it.  Start with the outside shape first. Next, poke a hole in each eye, then cut the eyes out. If you want the mask to be more symmetrical, fold the paper in half first, then cut along one of the lines that you drew. When you unfold the mask, it will be symmetrical ., Cut a piece of thin elastic. Tie a knot in each end. Staple each end of the elastic to each side of the mask. Make sure that the knot is inside the mask so that it holds. If you can't find thin elastic, do the following:   Punch a hole and each side of the mask. Cut two long pieces of ribbon. Tie a ribbon to each hole. Use the ribbons to tie the mask on the back of your head.  Use the same type of paper as you did for the mask body. You will be cutting both ears out at the same time.   If you decide to use painted paper, make sure that you paint both sides.  Rotate the paper so that the folded edge is on the side. Cut out a large triangle that is almost the same height and width as the paper. This will give you some extra-large ears.   You can cut smaller ears if you prefer.  Hold the ears together and cut them at the same time. Separate the ears when you are done. Your ears will have two flaps at the bottom., Take your first ear. Pull the left flap over the right flap until the ear curves. Secure the flaps with a glue stick.Repeat this step for the other ear.  Take your first ear. Coat the overlapped flaps with glue. Slide the ear behind the top corner of the mask. Run your finger across the mask to seal the mask against the flaps.The ear will sort of flop forward.   Repeat this step with the other ear.  Take a look at you mask. If the flaps are covering part of the eye hole, trim them away with a pair of scissors., Hold the paper widthwise, then roll it into a narrow cone. You want the tip to be about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide. You want the base to be a few inches/centimeters across. Secure the cone with tape or glue.   The paper needs to be the same type that you used for your ears and mask body.  Flatten the cone so that it has two folded edges. Open the cone up and flatten it the other way. When you open the cone up again, the openings at the base and tip should be shaped like squares., Cut a 2 to 3-inch (5.08 to 7.63-centimeter) slit into each folded edge. Only do this on the wider end of the cone, not the narrower one. You will be turning these into flaps so that you can attach the muzzle., Fold all flaps down towards the outside of the cone. Use the slits you cut as a guide. Choose a side to be the underside of the muzzle, then cut that flap off.  Position the muzzle so that bridge of the nose is just below the eyes. Once you are happy with the position, secure the flaps with glue. Part of the muzzle will be hanging below the mask body.  If there are any flaps covering the eyes, be sure to cut those away too.  This is not absolutely necessary, but it can give your mask a nice touch. Tear short strips of red, brown, or orange paper. They need to be about ¼ to ½ inch (064 to 1.27 centimeters) wide and about 1 inch long. Curl them around a pen or pencil, then glue them around the edges of the mask.You can use just one row, or add more rows until you reach the eyes.  Cut two circles out of tissue paper. Fold them in half, and cut a short fringe into the curved edge. Glue each folded circle to the bottom of each ear. Use a dab of glue to keep the circles flat.If you don't have white tissue paper, a plain tissue or coffee filter will also work. Alternatively, you can paint the inside of the ears white instead. Consider adding some black to the tips of the ears. You can do this by lightly shading them in with crayon, pencil, or paint.  There are a few ways you can do this. The simplest way would be to paint the area around the eyes using white paint. You can also tear more short, thin trips out of white paper, then glue them around the eyes for a feathery look.You can use regular white paper or tissue paper for this. Consider outlining the eye holes with black marker to make them more expressive.  Use white acrylic paint and a paintbrush to apply some paint to the sides and underside of the muzzle. Extend the paint up the angled side flaps.  Run some hot glue around the inside edge of the narrow opening at the top of your cone. Quickly press a small, black pompom into the opening.   Match the pompom to the opening size. If the opening is around ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then use a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) pompom. Alternatively, you can cover the opening with two strips of masking tape, then color the tape black with a permanent marker or acrylic paint.,	Get a sheet of red, brown, or orange cardstock. Figure out where your eyes will go. Refine the mask shape. Cut the mask out. Attach some elastic so that you can wear the mask. Fold a sheet of red, orange, or paper in half widthwise. Cut a large triangle out. Cut a 2-inch (5.08-cenitmeter) slit in the bottom-center of each ear. Overlap the flaps to curve the ears, then secure them with glue. Glue the ears to the back of the mask. Trim away the excess flap, if necessary. Roll a sheet of red, brown, or orange paper into a narrow cone. Shape the cone into a pyramid. Cut four slits into the bottom edge of the cone. Fold three of the flaps and cut the forth one off. Secure the muzzle to the bottom of the mask. Trim off the excess flaps hanging over the edges of the mask. Give the mask a furred texture with torn strips of paper. Add some ear tufts using white tissue paper. Add some white around the eyes. Paint the sides and bottom of the muzzle white. Hot glue a small, black pompom into the nose opening. Finished.
The goal of a song is to express an idea. This could be very simplistic or complicated, but it has to come from somewhere, and mean something to you. Some of the best places people seek inspiration are at coffee shops, where lovers and/or friends meet up, talk, kiss, and interact. Other songwriters like going out into the woods where they can hear the birds chirping, and experience the awesome solemnity of nature.Look for a place which suits your needs. If you need interaction, go to a crowded place. If you need silence, take a drive or sit by the lake. Spend some time using all of your sensory abilities. Look to see the colors around you, listen to the sounds you hear, feel the table in front of you, and smell the multitude of aromas. The ideas you come up with don't necessarily have to be serious or intricate. Especially when it comes to pop songs, short, sweet, and upbeat thoughts are especially welcome.; , Grab a sheet of paper and a pencil/pen when you go to seek your inspiration. Every time you hear, touch, smell, or see something interesting, write a word or two down which represents it. For example, I hear a bird calling in the woods so I write down "feather, echo, call, hear me." Compile a large list of these as you travel to different locations and seek inspiration from elsewhere.Carry a small 2X4 inch journal in your pocket when you travel. This way you will have a way to keep your ideas contained together, and always have something to write an idea down on. Put stars around, or underline words which weigh on you heavily. These might be words you want to focus on when you later write your song.  You do not want to write a song about love, death, depression, working, dreams, and learning who you are. One of those works just fine, and will help to focus the minds of your listeners later on. Take your random word lists, and begin to cross certain words off. Begin a permanent list on another piece of paper.Each of these important words should center on one topic. For example, "gravel, breeze, going home, rough road, time, open space" would center around the concept of "taking your own path in life." Begin to connect and number the words in the order you want them in your song. Using the previous example, "1. open space, 2. breeze, 3. rough road, 4. going home." You need some open space so you go on a car ride. During the car ride you experience the breeze of the outside air. However, you begin to feel how rough the road is, so you decide to make your way back home. It is important that the topic you choose is relatable to everyone. Since this will be a pop song, it is going to be popular to a wide range of audiences. For example, topics like sadness or longing might be more relatable to a general audience than depression.  Every topic has already been sung about, whether it be love, sadness, happiness, longing, hope, trustworthiness, etc. The key is to either say something new about it, or say it in a different way. This is where the use of metaphor really comes in handy. The descriptions you pick up on can be transformed into a highly engaging topic about an old conversation.For example, you might notice the way a bird's feathers flutter in the wind. You can then use this detail as a metaphor for the way your life is going, i.e. up and down. Rather than just explicitly saying "up and down" you use a metaphor that explains your thinking. Paint a picture with these metaphors. Do not string a whole bunch of them together randomly. For instance, if you are using the bird metaphor, stick with the bird. Talk about the way it dives, eats, sleeps, breathes, etc. That vivid imagery will capture the imaginations of your song listeners.  Don't worry about rhyming yet, as much as writing your lyrics in complete sentences. Take your important words and build around them with active verbs, adjectives, etc. Write your lyrics as if you were writing a movie script. Tell a story using "you" more than you use "I."The basic structure of a pop song goes: verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, chorus, interlude, chorus. There are two sets of verses where you can really get into telling your story. The first verse will introduce your listener to the story. The second verse can either repeat the same sentiment of the first verse, or change the direction of your story. The chorus has to be the same every time you sing it in order for the listener to latch on to the song. This part of the song should clearly represent the main idea you are driving at. If your song is about going home, tell the listener you are going home, either manifestly (I'm going home) or latently (I'm going back to the place where it began). Remember, some part of the chorus will likely become the title of your song.  Before you begin tweaking/altering your lyrics, you will want to figure out the general beat of your song. The rhythm will tell your listeners, even without words, the mood of your song. For songs about sadness, or longing, the rhythm is usually slower, while happy songs are generally more upbeat.Above each word, write full, half, or quarter notes. This will let you know how long you want to sing each word. Sad songs have a lot more full notes, while happy songs are generally full of quarter, and sometimes even eighth notes. The chorus, of either a sad or happy pop song, will have a consistent rhythm throughout the song. When it comes to verses, sad songs have a more freewheeling style. They can go slower or faster, and change up in between. Happy songs should have both consistent chorus lines and verses respectively throughout.  This is probably the most important part of a pop song. Pop songs are played on a radio, and therefore, there is a short time to "hook" the audience. The hook of your song draws them in and keeps them interested. Sit down at a piano, or pull out your guitar. Begin practicing different riffs. Alternate the riff to suit your particular song.One of the best examples of a riff is "Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones. The entry to this song immediately gets the audience hooked. Note that the riff does not necessarily have to be the same as the melody or rhythm. The hook can be used solely at the beginning to draw the audience in, or it can be used throughout and remain in the background. A song like "Satisfaction" uses the riff throughout, while a song like "Train, Train" by Blackfoot only uses a harmonica riff at the very beginning.  There is no perfect formula for this as there is a different melody for every song ever made. However, pop songs generally hand a mixture of repetition and variation that make the song easy to remember. Read the words of your song out loud, over and over again, until your mind begins to attach some notes to the words.One way to find inspiration for a melody is to listen to other pop songs. You might find a melody someone else used, and create a variation on it. After you have figured out a melody for the first line of a verse, apply it to the second as well. Change the melody for the third line, and then come back to the original melody for the fourth. This is a common pattern in pop songs which creates a level of repetition that a general audience likes (1, 1, 2, 1). Remember that melodies will change when you transition from verses to chorus lines. Pop songs have strong chorus melodies which allow the singer to belt out and become emotional (either happy or sad). Have the peak notes of your song fall within the chorus, such as extreme high notes and/or long notes.  Pop songs generally use 3 or 4 note chord progressions. Type into Google the name of any song followed by the word "chord" and it will tell you what chords were used. For example, the song "Firework" by Katy Perry has the following chord progression: | G | Am | Em | C | Chord progressions for pop songs, like in "Firework" are repeated for the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus.You can use chord progressions from other songs, just not lyrics or melodies. However, feel free to add or change one of the notes to suit your song best. If you repeat a chord progression, change the scale you play it in. This creates some level of variation between the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus. For example, "Firework" has a steady low chord progression for the first verse. The pre-chorus ranges from low to high, and the chorus is a steady high chorus progression. Once you have figured out what chords you would like, you can go back and attach it to the rhythm and melody. You may want to add/delete words in your lyrics as join together the rhythm, melody, and chords.  This usually comes after you sing the chorus a second time, and before the third time. It could be a guitar solo or a piano solo. The singer might want to belt out long notes with various modulations in their voice. This interlude should flow naturally from the song, rather than being an interjection.For example, you can build on notes in chorus lines. The first time you sing the chorus, sing notes relatively short. The second time, sing them longer, stretching them out. You can then go straight into a bridge which allows you to sing the same notes for as long as you want. Mix it up. A lot of pop songs might start an interlude with long, belted notes and then transition into a piano or guitar solo. The options are nearly endless. Reel the interlude back in so that you can end the song. Remember, you want distinguished lines between the different sections.  A common way to end a pop song is to simply repeat the chorus line over and over again as the song fades away. Many Aerosmith songs such as "Love in an Elevator" use this fading action a lot. It is best used for loud, rhythmic, hard edged chorus lines. Other, more sad songs might end better coming back to your original starting point. If you started off slow and soft, bring it back there, to effectively "close" your story.You can also end your song on an instrumental, however, this is usually an artistic license allotted to bands which already have names for themselves. For example, the ending to Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" is over five minutes worth of instrumentals. However, you can play your basic riff a couple of times at the end of your song, just begging your audience to repeat and play again.  After you have finished adding the music to your lyrics, you will want to go back and add your rhymes in. In modern day pop songs, there is more "free-styling" when it comes to lyrics but there is still a basic rhyme format. The trick of the pop song is to make it easy to remember, and rhymes facilitate that.Type a word into Google and add "rhymes with" next to it. A list of words will pop up and help you decide on which word best fits. Depending on the particular word choices you may have to go back and change some of the melody/rhythm. This is a back and forth, give and take process.  Use the strengths of the people around you to help make your song better. Find out whether a person you know plays an instrument. For example, if you are doing a very upbeat pop song, you might want someone who knows how to play a trumpet, or someone who is a good DJ.Other friends or family might be able to lend their voices to your effort, and harmonize with your melody. You might also want to ask around for anybody that has an "in" into the music business. Someone who has already recorded an album, or who has worked with a record company, might be able to get your song some radio air time.  Record it on your computer or stereo. Listen back and see if you can follow it. The words should sound crisp and clear as they will be memorized by millions of pop song listeners. There should be clear, distinguished lines between the verses, pre-chorus line, and chorus lines. Your interlude should flow naturally with the rest of the song, rather than intrude on its progression.Pop songs, like other songs, are never perfect the first go around. Rerecord the song until it is exactly right. Note how you feel during the song. The essence of a good pop song is if you can feel the emotions you are trying to convey.  This can literally be anything you want it to be, but it should have something to do with your topic. Often times pop songs have titles which use lines from the chorus. This makes it easier for a general audience to look up your song later on. However, if your song is very metaphorical, you may want to give your song a more obvious title.For example, if your song is about depression, but you never explicitly say it in the song, your title should reflect it.	Seek inspiration or influence. Brainstorm different ideas. Focus your ideas on a singular topic. Say something old in a new way. Construct an outline for your lyrics. Attach a rhythm groove to your outlined lyrics. Begin your song with a hook. Decide on a melody for your song. Create a chord progression. Add a bridge or interlude. End your song. Copy edit your lyrics and notes. Collaborate with family, friends, or partners. Listen to your song. Come up with a title for your song.

To attract an agent or other clients, make a website and build a social media presence. You need to be easily located and well represented online.Make a professional-looking website that showcases your work. Your website should include examples of your work, your artist CV, and a list of events (gallery shows, performances, etc) that you have participated in.   If you are a performer, include headshots. If you are a visual artist, you should have online portfolios of your work. Consider getting a Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook page, or other form of social media. Post examples of your work and updates on your progress. This can be a great way to connect with other artists, as well as with talent agents.; , Whether you are a musician, a writer, an actor, or a painter, you can benefit from the help of a professional who represents talent. Read your contract carefully, however, especially if you are a musician. You should retain the rights to your own work.   . Look up agents who represent other artists you admire and ask for an interview. If you get an interview, ask how many clients they represent-avoid agents who are overbooked. Get a gallery to represent you. Visit galleries and talk to the curators. If you like the art they show, they might like your art. Galleries will show your work in exchange for a cut of the profits. . Send a demo to record labels you like. Consider getting a manager to facilitate this process.  If you are a visual artist, exhibit your work at art fairs. In some cases you may already need gallery representation to do this, but in others you can show and sell your work for an entry fee. If you are a performer, put on amateur shows and invite friends and other artists to watch.   If you are a writer, connect with local reading series and ask to be included in a lineup. If you are a musician, send demos to local music venues and ask them to book you for a show.  Collaboration is a great way to become known in your community, which can open up doors for you over time. Consider forming or joining an artist's collective, making collaborative work with other artists, putting on a show with a group of artists you admire, or otherwise working to promote (and become known to) your peers.	Represent yourself online. Seek representation. Exhibit your work yourself. Work with other artists.
Not only will this information help you get rid of the frogs, since different species respond to different methods, but it will also ensure that you're not doing something illegal, as some species of frogs are protected by law. There are some species of frogs that are considered invasive and are legal to kill. These include the following:   Bullfrogs outside of their native environment in eastern North America. They compete with native frogs, eat native frogs, and spread chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease that has led to the extinction of 100 frog species. Cane toads outside of their native environment in Central and South America. While not a frog, many people reading this article will be dealing with these amphibians. They are especially rampant in Australia.       Cuban tree frogs outside of their native habitat in Cuba. These are a big nuisance in Florida, where they even cause power outages.Coqui frogs outside of their native environment in Puerto Rico.      ; , In many parts of the world, it's illegal to kill non-invasive species, but people are encouraged to manage invasive species. Some species are so invasive that it's illegal to release them back into the wild once you've caught them.   If you're not sure whether a frog is native or not, take its picture and submit it to the local Fish and Wildlife authorities for identification. Before you take matters into your own hands, you might want to talk to local Fish and Wildlife authorities to discuss the best way to get rid of them in your area.  If you find out that the frogs in your area are native species, you'd do best to leave them alone. Frogs that are native to a certain ecosystem should not be killed, even if they're poisonous. Frogs are vital members of their ecosystems, and in fact their presence is an indication that an ecosystem is healthy. They keep insect populations down and contribute to wetlands in other ways.  If you dislike the presence of native frogs, there are still ways to discourage them from coming onto your property. You can keep foliage cut back, for example, so they won't have an enticing place to live. You can also discourage them from coming into the house by keeping it well sealed and screening your windows and doors.  Frogs are attracted to moisture, so removing sources of water from your yard will cause most frogs to lose interest and find another place to lay their eggs and shelter at night. You can rent a pump to get rid of most water sources.   Birdbaths, swampy areas, bowls of water, and artificial ponds are just a few examples of water sources that attract frogs.       Removing sources of stagnant water will also drive away mosquitoes and other insects that frogs feed on, making the area even less appealing. If the water source in your yard is something you want to keep, like a natural pond, try adding a filter or running fountain to your pond. This will cause the water to circulate, thereby eliminating most mosquitoes and other insects. The frogs will still be attracted to the water, but with a decrease in food supply, many may still end up moving on.  Tall grass, shrubs, or other bushy plants make the perfect hiding place for frogs. Clearing these elements away forces the frogs to be exposed, which is a condition they generally try to avoid. Having tall plants around a water source is especially troublesome. If you want to maintain tall or bushy plants somewhere in your yard, position them as far away from any water source as possible.  Like tall grass, clutter in your yard serves as an excellent hiding place for frogs. Removing it will chase many frogs away. Remove empty pots, old lumber, piles of wood chips, or any other structure that may create a damp, dark place for frogs to hide.  Turning off your outdoor lights at night will reduce both insect and frog populations.   Shut off garden lights and porch lights. Close the drapes and curtains in your house to reduce the amount of light filtering out from inside.  While somewhat uncommon, frogs do occasionally steal dog food or cat food. Feed your pets inside or keep the dish inside when the dog or cat is not eating.  Since flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are the primary food source for frogs, killing the bugs will deter frogs from coming to your yard. Here are a few ways to control them;   Use a bug zapper. Place the bug zapper on your porch to attract and kill all manner of flying insects.       Spray organic insecticides. Many chemical insecticides will also kill the frogs, but most organic insecticides do not have that effect.  Surround your property or pond with mesh netting or plastic fencing. Do not use chicken wire or chain-link fencing, since frogs can easily slip through these types of fences.   Make sure that the fencing starts at ground level and stands tall. Frogs can leap a considerable height, so a standard-size fence will work better than a purposefully low one. Take precautions to keep the fence stable. Bury the support posts 1 foot (30.5 cm) underground, at minimum, and bury a portion of the fencing material beneath the ground, too.  Snakes and cats both love to eat some types of frogs, so if you introduce some to your property, you'll be able to keep the population down, and your yard will be a lot less attractive to frogs. Before you do this, conduct some research to make sure the type of frog you're dealing with will make a tasty meal for a cat or snake.  Remember that many types of frogs are poisonous. Don't try to introduce a predator that would be sensitive to the frogs' poison. Research the predators of the specific frog you're dealing with. Cats and snakes are easiest to introduce, but you might also want to make your yard more hospitable to other predator animals, such as hawks or other birds.  There are a few natural substances that effectively kill frogs or repel them from the area. Try using one of these substances before resorting to a chemical spray, since chemical sprays tend to kill the frogs slowly. Organic sprays tend to do the job more quickly and are more humane.  Spray the frogs with citric acid. Mix 1.3 lb (600 g) dry citric acid with 1 gallon (4 liters) of water in a large spray bottle.Spray the solution directly on the frogs. It should kill them almost immediately. Spread salt. If you do not have any plants near your pond, spread a little salt around the perimeter. Salt will burn the toes of the frogs, deterring them from the area. Note that salt will destroy plants, however. Spritz the frogs with caffeine. Concentrated caffeine will kill frogs by causing them to have heart attacks, but you can spread coffee grounds around the areas where frogs gather to deter them without killing them off. It will cause the frogs discomfort, but will not likely kill them.  While there are chemical pest control measures you can take to get rid of the frogs in your yard, these options often torment or kill the frogs slowly and should be avoided unless no other option has proven effective. When possible, use repelling measures rather than lethal ones.   Try snake repellent.Spraying snake repellent around the perimeter of your yard is often an effective repellent against frogs. In fact, snake repellent is usually about as effective at getting rid of frogs as it is at getting rid of snakes.       Use herbicide. Studies suggest that certain weed killers chemically alter male frogs, stripping away their ability to reproduce. As a result, spraying these herbicides in areas where frogs gather can greatly reduce future frog populations.  Use a butterfly net or another type of long-handled, thinly-meshed net to capture the frogs one by one. If you have an abundance of frogs, you may need to enlist the help of others to accomplish this task. Once you catch the frogs, you have two choices:   Relocate the frogs. After catching the frogs, consider relocating them to a nearby pond or stream. When relocating frogs, however, it is important to introduce the frogs to an area that the breed or species can be naturally found in. Otherwise, you can upset the ecological balance of that habitat. Freeze the frogs to death.If it is impossible to relocate the frogs, you can kill them humanely by freezing them. Place the frogs in a sealable container with air holes punched through the lid. Store this container in the refrigerator overnight. The frogs will ease into a coma-like state. The following day, move the container to the freezer and store the frogs there for 48 to 72 hours. Temperatures this cold should kill them.  Use a standard aquarium fishnet to scoop up any tadpoles in your pond or other water source. Lay the tadpoles out in the sun for a day or so. The dry heat should kill them.   You can lay the captured tadpoles out on the cement or lawn, but the drier to surface, the quicker the extermination should be. Alternatively, you could also bury the captured tadpoles underground. This, too, should kill them.  If the frogs have found their way indoors, set up standard mouse traps to kill them. Place these traps around any opening that leads from the outside to the inside, such as garage doors, basement windows and vents.  If you are uncertain about how to remove the frogs or are unsuccessful in your efforts, hire a professional.	Identify the frog species you're dealing with. Check the laws in your area. Leave native frogs alone. Drain any standing water. Trim your weeds. Clear away debris. Turn off outside lighting.Light attracts insects, and insects attract frogs. Keep pet food inside the house. Kill the insects on your property. Set up fencing. Introduce natural predators. Try natural repellants. Use chemicals only as a last resort. Catch the frogs with a net. Gather and destroy the tadpoles. Set traps indoors. Hire an exterminator.
If you are not in your own vehicle and your choices are running on foot or using a vehicle, opt for the vehicle. It's still extremely dangerous, but will give you better odds of surviving than being on foot.If you do not have your own vehicle but find an abandoned vehicle as you flee from the fire, enter the vehicle and hotwire the car. If you need to break a window to enter the vehicle, break a rear window so that the front windows can remain closed. This is important, as it will help keep smoke out of the vehicle. Do not break into and hot wire a car that someone is likely to come looking for. You should never take someone else's means of escaping the fire. This method is only really applicable if you find a car that someone clearly left behind to flee on foot.  Once you're in a car, you'll need to ensure that the car is safely sealed from the smoke surrounding you. This is crucial, since you will otherwise risk passing out from carbon monoxide.   Roll up the windows and close the air vents., If the vehicle runs and you're capable of driving it, then do so. But it's important to drive safely, so that you can see your surroundings and so that anyone else on the road can see you.   Drive slowly and keep your headlights on.Keep an eye out for other vehicles and pedestrians. Stop to let any pedestrians you encounter ride along with you.Do not drive through heavy smoke. If the smoke is too thick to see where you're steering, it may be safer to park and wait it out.If you must stop the vehicle, park as far away from trees and heavy brush as possible., If the smoke is too thick to see the road, or if you cannot drive the car for any reason, you should remain in the vehicle. You will be more likely to be injured or killed by leaving the vehicle than you would be if you remained inside.Don't worry about the gas tank. Vehicles with metal gas tanks rarely ever explode. You are much safer staying inside the car than you would be on foot.Keep the windows up and the air vents closed.Lie down on the floor of the vehicle and cover yourself with a blanket or coat, if possible., Whether you are able to drive or you are forced to hunker down inside a vehicle, it's important to know what to expect so that you do not panic. Just remember that no matter what happens, if the fire surrounds the car you should not leave the vehicle.The temperature inside the vehicle will increase considerably. Don't worry - it's still safer inside the vehicle than outside.Air currents low to the ground may rock the car. Some smoke and even sparks may enter the vehicle. Don't be alarmed. Just stay low on the floor of the vehicle and keep breathing through a wet cloth to protect your airways.	Find a vehicle. Ensure that you can breathe. Drive if you can. Remain in the vehicle. Know what to expect.
Certain people are at higher risk of blood clots or DVT than others. If you fall into one of the following categories, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking special precautions when traveling. Risk factors include:Being older than 40 Being overweight Not taking anticoagulant medication as prescribed A genetic blood clotting condition Having cancer or receiving cancer treatment Being pregnant or a recent delivery or c-section Taking hormone therapy or birth control pills Smoking A recent major surgery A broken bone in a lower body extremity (ankle, foot, leg, etc.); , Consider an injection of anticoagulant medication if you have cancer, had a recent surgery or have thrombophilia. Depending on your medical history and condition, one of the steps that could help is to take an anticoagulant medication such as heparin. An injection of heparin can thin your blood and make it less likely to clot during the long flight. Ask your doctor whether this is a good option for you., Doctor-recommended compression stockings are a good lifestyle change if you are at risk of blood clots or have an upcoming flight.You should ask your doctor or pharmacist about the appropriate type of stocking, which may be a graduated compression stocking. They should go all the way up to your knee and can help improve circulation when used alongside regular exercise., An aisle seat will allow you to move your legs a little bit more during the flight, which will help improve circulation and reduce the risk of blood clots. Book your flight early so you can be sure to get an aisle seat.You may also be able to pay a little more for a row with extra leg room. If you can afford it, this may be another option to give yourself more space to stretch out.  People who travel on flights longer than four hours are at an increased risk of blood clots. If you can take a vacation or attend an event a little bit closer to home, you will reduce your risk. See if you can meet friends, family or colleagues somewhere a little closer, perhaps less than a four-hour flight away.If a long trip is absolutely necessary, consider breaking it up with stops in between and give yourself time to rest, relax and walk about for a day or two between the legs of your trip. If it is not possible, you should at least give yourself a few hours of rest between flights. In this time, you should walk around and stretch.	Know your risk. Ask your doctor about anticoagulant medication. Get compression stockings. Book an aisle seat. Avoid long, uninterrupted flights.
Before you so much as peek in the window, get down on one knee and check the ground for underneath the car for spots, drips or puddles. If they are there, try to figure out their age - are they old oil streaks or fresh spots? Perhaps there's even a puddle that has an active drip filling it from above?   Take a look, and decide whether this car just accidentally parked over an old spill, or if it is losing precious fluids right before your eyes. Although this is not always a deal breaker, any kind of drip, ooze, leak or seep can be indicative of much larger problems.       Dealers and owners will tell you that a little oil seepage is normal and this is partly true - some makes and models are notorious for leaking oil, but that doesn't mean that the car is in trouble. It's just up to you whether you think it's worth it to occasionally have to add oil.      ; , Puddles can also be made from brake lines, cooling systems, transmissions, power steering or even washer fluid. If you find a wet spot, you might want to poke it with your finger.   Reddish fluid is probably transmission fluid. Black fluid is generally just old oil. Caramel is the color of fresh oil, or old power steering or brake fluid. Green or orange fluid is probably coolant. Be mindful of clear puddles, which might be just water, meaning it rained, the engine was washed or the A/C has been running recently. Once you have some on your finger tip you should be able to tell if it is oil or water-based. If it seems like both, look out, and pay more attention in the following steps.  Sellers will often take a hose to a car they want to sell, and some will even try to clean up the engine compartment, but just as a rule, the underbelly of the car will be overlooked. Puddles or no, look to see how clean things are. You can probably ignore plain old dirt, and even expect to see a certain amount of road grime and greasy spots (It's a car, after all) but you'll want to watch out for drips or beads of fluids that have formed but not yet dropped.   Keep an eye out for wet spots, dark spots, and clumps of filthy oily sludge, paying close attention to the oil pan, and any seams or gaskets you can spot. It is not uncommon for there to be a little grime leftover from past issues that have since been fixed. However, fresh, wet grime or oil can mean problems, so take note of what you see. Don't hesitate to poke at things (maybe use a paper towel) to see how drippy, wet, slimy, or caked on they might be.  If you do see drips or runs of wet sludge, try to sort out where they are coming from. Leakiness might be enough to get you to move on to the next car in the lot, but it will be up to you to decide if leaks alone are enough of a problem to prevent you from buying the car.   Some folks will happily add oil to make up for a drippy oil pan, and can go for years without any serious repercussions beyond the expense and inconvenience of it. Some leaks are minor, and can take months to add up to significant losses, while some get progressively worse and can lead to real problems. If nothing is obviously leaking, dripping, or caked over with sludge, you can start feeling confident. A great number of potential engine problems can be ruled-out just by there being no visible loss of fluids.  Before you ever even start the engine, have your seller pop the hood for you, just so you can have a look at the engine and take note of any smells.   A pristine, shiny new engine should smell of rubber and plastic with a hint of gas or oil. In the best of all possible conditions, you will smell fumes that naturally come off belts, hoses, and the various plastic parts. This is called outgassing, and is completely normal. The smell of an engine compartment should not be too different from the smell of new tires. In a used car, you will almost certainly smell oil. This is normal, and so long as it isn't overwhelming, it's not something you need to be afraid of. You may also smell gas. A whiff of it is perfectly normal, and in older cars with carburetors, even a good solid waft of gas-imbued fumes is not an uncommon thing. However, if you are smelling a lot, that might mean a leak in the fuel system and could be a cause for concern. You may also smell turpentine, which is essentially the smell of bad, old gas. That smell might mean the car has just been sitting for a while. You should be able to ask your seller if there is fresh gas in the tank, and how long the car has been sitting for. This is not usually a huge deal, but stagnant gas can cause problems, up to and including rust in the gas tank. Another possibility is the sickly sweet smell of antifreeze. This could just be from spills, but you'll still need to check for leaks in the cooling system. On a cold motor, these can be spotted by a white-to greenish film; a sign that coolant has evaporated. An acrid, tart smell may also be present, which will indicate a need to take a closer look at the battery at some point.  Take a look at the engine. Do you see paint? Bare metal? Gunk? Dirt? Keep in mind that it may be preferable to see dirt or even cobwebs. Dealers and sellers will often clean up an engine compartment both to be courteous, and to make it look nice This does make the engine look better, but it can remove evidence of leaks, and even steer your eye away from obvious flaws.   A dirt covered engine, on the other hand, will show you where every drop of oil or gas has been, will show you which parts have been tinkered with or replaced (clean spots), and also indicates that the car has been driven, which means it has at least recently been working. Cobwebs tell you that it's been sitting a while, which may mean nothing, or may mean extra steps later on. A sludge-caked, grimy engine is a good and a bad thing. It an indicate a leak, but at least you can locate the source of the leak by following the path of the sludge. If it's just a heap of sludge and blackened goo, it may be time for new gaskets, or even a rebuild. However, this does not mean that the engine itself has gone bad, nor even that you won't be able to drive it for years before having real problems. A fuel leak will often actually create a clean spot on an otherwise dirty engine, but usually fuel leaks are fairly subtle, and you'll need to use your nose to know if they actually exist.  By now you will have stumbled across your oil dipstick. Pull it, clean it off, put it back, pull it again. Is there oil? Good. At this point, the oil can even be low, so long as there is some in there. Most cars will not show correct oil levels unless they are warm.   If you have an automatic transmission, there is another dipstick in there, so you should check this too, using the same remove/clean/replace/remove method. Again, you just want to be sure that there is some transmission fluid in there.       If you have power steering, there will be a pump in there somewhere. Usually this pump just has a lid with a small dipstick. Check to make sure that there is at least some fluid in there. Also check your brake fluids, while you are at it. Usually your brake fluid reservoir is translucent, and you can see without opening anything where the level is.       Finally, you should also check the coolant levels and the washer fluid levels. Take note of anything with low levels, and remember if you end up buying this vehicle to top everything off to its appropriate levels.  Ask your seller when the car's belts and hoses were last replaced. Cracks in the rubber most likely means that these parts will need to be replaced soon. A clever clean-up, and even old ratty belts and hoses can look fine on the surface, so don't be shy about reaching around in the engine compartment, squeezing hoses and plucking at belts.   If the belts are a little shoddy, just keep in mind that these will need to be replaced. Most dealers will have made an assessment of such problems, but you aren't necessarily working with a dealer, and these things sometimes get overlooked. Mainly, you just need to make sure that there are belts in there. Some cars won't start without them, but some have second belts that charge things or let your A/C and power steering work, so do be sure that every pulley you see has either a belt attached or a good reason not to have one. Check for soft, mushy cooling hoses, which is a clearer sign of age than their outward appearance. Check the areas where the hoses attach to things, and look for the telltale film of hot leaks. These leaky spots sometimes only develop when engines are hot, so there won't be any dripping, and a good dose of engine cleaner can make them vanish, so you do need to really look to see if there is even a trace of residue, not unlike the hard water scaling you sometimes have to clean from your teakettle.  It's not uncommon at all for used cars to drain their batteries as they sit, so don't be discouraged if the car needs a jump start at some point.  For now, take a look at the battery itself to be sure it isn't cracked or leaking. Look for exposed cable, which is not terrible as long as it has not turned green, or become caked in white residue.       Look for white (or green, or green/white) residue caked on the terminals as well. Usually this is just a sign of an aging battery that has been sitting a while, and can be cleaned up with a toothbrush and some soda water, and a toothbrush. Again, the best possibility is a layer of regular old dusty dirt, on otherwise clean metal and plastic. This doesn't mean it's a good battery or that the terminals aren't corroded in a way you can't see, but it does mean that no such potential problems have been hidden by an auto detailer's hard work.  If you are buying a car from a dealer, the air filter should be clean and new. If you're buying from a person, it could be old and dirty and need replacing.   If the air filter needs replacing, it is likely that more (if not all) of the filters (such as the oil, gas, cabin air, transmission filters) are due to be replaced as well. Ask your seller if you aren't sure or if you don't want to dig into the air filter to see for yourself.  If the car has a turbo charger, that's likely something you won't be able to diagnose until the car is running. However, at the very least you can check for leaks and make sure it is connected and not rusted through.  Step back and take a wide view of the engine compartment and its various goings-on. Every make and model has a different setup - there might be a lot going on, or it might be a fairly common and simple situation.   Look for loose wires and hoses. Look for little things that you might not understand, but look off to you, like uncovered holes or potential missing parts. Newer cars are harder to sort out, what with electronics (look for scorches, burns, obvious damage) and complicated vacuum systems. Older cars are simpler, and are more forgiving of after-market tampering. Discuss any changes or modifications your seller has made.  Stop and take a closer look at the underside of your used car's hood. There are clues there, if not always clear indicators. What you want to see is a clean, (again, regular dirt is not a problem) and intact liner, which is there to muffle engine noise and also to act as a fire retardant.   A sludgy, leaky, oil-burning car might have blackened the liner. If the underside of your hood is just darkened, it's likely not a problem, but if any part of it is scorched, burned, or has been torn away or removed, that's a sign of a past engine fire.       If you find evidence of fire, ask when and how it happened, and you may find that the engine has been rebuilt, in which case you just want to be concerned about any current leaks of fuel or oil. A past engine fire should at the very least make you wary, but even such a sordid history does not by itself mean the car is simply no good.  Exhaust leaks are one of the things that can cause engine fires. You might not have a good view of the exhaust manifold in the engine compartment, but it's easy enough to check the tailpipe. The exhaust tip should be ashy grey on the inside.   If it is black on the inside, this means that the car has been running rich (too much gas in the air/fuel mix), which is bad but not terrible, and usually just means poor fuel economy. White tips mean the car is running lean (too much air in the air/fuel mix), which makes for increased wear and tear, and a hot running engine.       In older cars this is a problem of timing and valve adjustment. In newer cars it indicates something wrong in the electronics; usually an O2 sensor, or perhaps an airflow sensor, sending inaccurate information to the computer, which then makes errors in regulating the mix. Either way, problems with the exhaust pipe will require a tune up.  So you've looked and sniffed and poked and grabbed, and nothing has scared you away thus far, so nothing to do but fire the car up and see if it goes. Three things could happen.   It starts and runs, first try. It takes a minute to get it going. It doesn't start.  You turned the key and nothing happened? Not so much as a dash light? Check the battery, and connections. Pay particular attention to the terminals, and make sure the cables are connected good and tight, and not corroded. Again, a little soda will help get these clean enough to keep a good contact.   Dash lights come on, you turn the key and then you hear a click, followed by nothing? Still probably just a dead battery, or even just a bad connection. Check it and charge it. Pull it out if you have to, or use jumper cables. The best practice is to remove the battery, connect an AC powered charger, and give it some time.       The engine turns over, but does not start? Give the gas pedal a good stomp, wait a few seconds, and try again. Pump the gas pedal as you turn it over. If this doesn't work, continue to try a couple more times. If the car has been sitting, it may just take some time for good fuel to be pumped from the tank to the engine. With any luck it will catch at some point and you'll likely not have to do that again.  If nothing is happening still, make sure the spark plug wires are snug. If you find a loose one, get it snug, and try again to start the car.   Still nothing? You will probably have to pull the spark plugs and clean them. If the car has a carburetor, you can also try dumping a few teaspoons of gas straight into the venturi (the part where the air goes in). This whole process sometimes has to be repeated, just to get the engine going after a car has been parked for a substantial amount of time. On that note, if you have a car sitting around and want to sell it, start it up once in a while so this doesn't happen.  Once you get the car running, get out and let the car idle while you look around the engine compartment again, and look for things smoking or leaking. Listen for wheezing, clicking, knocking or thumping sounds. Sniff for gas fumes (there will be a little) or burning (there might be some). Here are something you may hear, and suggestions as to what they might mean:   "TicTicTicTicTic" noise, increasing in speed as you rev the engine. Sticky lifters, flat cams, loose valves, and even a loose belt can do this. If it goes away after you add oil, or after the car gets good and warm, that's a lifter. Although it's nothing to panic about, it's something you'll want to address at some point in the future. A "NokNokNokNok" noise that increases in frequency when the engine is revved is called an engine knock. This can be bad news and might be a sign that you should walk away from this particular car (unless it's a diesel, in which case this is exactly how it's supposed to sound). Squealing, shrieking, squawking? This is usually the belt, or belts, and sometimes the pulleys that they turn on. Plan to change the belt. If the noise continues after changing the belt, you'll need to figure out which pulley. Alternators and air conditioner pumps can make these noises too, and can also just make scraping noises. Be mindful of such sounds, but unless they really start to bother you, don't worry too much A louder knock which does not match RPMs but may be present while accelerating or at low idle might indicate an engine or transmission mount that needs to be replaced. Not an emergency, but you'll want to get that fixed too, at some point.  Everything seem good? Close the hood, and if you are taking a test drive, take it straight to your local auto parts store and have them connect and check codes for other little things you might not have noticed. This only applies to cars from the 80's and later, and usually only helpful if there is a check engine light on after you start.   Your parts guy or your mechanic can help you out from there. You've done pretty much everything you need to do to be sure your engine is at least sound enough to get you to the store. As you drive take note of any issues such as a distinct lack of power, any odd shuddering, or any other sort of odd behavior. The code reader can give you some details to get you started on the process of replacing parts and electronics and getting things tuned in. Your local auto parts counterman has a device that can check your car's computer codes, and most will do it for free if they have the time. If someone tries to charge you for a checkup, drive on down to the next place. You might need a tune up, or even a rebuild. If you made it this far, though, you have a working engine. Congratulations. Your fluid levels filled, your battery charged, good gas in the tank, and you're driving. See how it feels - in the end that's what's important.	Check for spots, drips and puddles underneath the car. Identify what type of fluid any puddles are made from. Inspect the undercarriage. Decide whether leaking is a problem for you. Pop the hood and take note of any smells coming from the engine. Take a long look at your engine compartment and its contents. Check the fluid levels. Inspect the belts and hoses. Inspect the battery and terminals.Like the engine, batteries and their cables can clean up nice and still be bad. Ask about the air filters. Make sure the turbo is connected and not rusty. Step back and look at the engine compartment as a whole. Look at the underside of your car's hood. Examine the exhaust pipe. Test the car to see if it starts. Figure out why the car won't start. Take a look at your spark plug wires. Listen to the sound of the engine once you get it running. Bring the car for a test drive.
If you're into bicycling, you should already have one. If you have more than one, use the old one, at least first, in case you ruin it. A helmet with a flattish rear end, not a pointed one, will be easiest to use.; , (A lamp that straps onto the user's head, associated with mining.) It must have a hinged front light mount to direct the beam up and down, with a wide adjustment range.   Preferably the front light will pivot within a low-profile enclosure rather than swinging on an arm, and the kit will have a rear-mounted battery pack with a bright red rear flasher, a high-power white front light, a stretchy coiled wire connecting the parts, and take relatively high capacity AA batteries. LEDs are a virtual necessity for a long, bright life. An old one with a dirty or bad strap would be perfect, since you won't use that part anyway.  Heavy-duty automotive trim style double-sided tape or epoxy putty are convenient and fill gaps; liquid epoxy is stronger. Get a thick, fast curing variety to not run off of curved surfaces.   Other adhesives may work, but finding one that will bond to but not attack helmet materials such as a mix of plastic and foam can be tricky. Clean all mating surfaces and allow them to dry for a good bond.  Take the light and any other electrical parts, such as a rear light, battery holder, and associated wires, off of the strap. The strap will not be needed for this project.  The main light must be mounted where it does not tilt to one side or the other - many have a narrow beam, so accuracy is critical, must have have an unobstructed path forward, must be able to pivot to shine straight ahead (preferably with some extra downward adjustment available) rather than tilted uselessly up, and must not be at the lower edge of the helmet but instead higher up where it will not knock into your face in an accident.   Placement of the battery pack is flexible if it does not have a rear light, but the rear light, whether or not integrated into the battery holder, must shine straight back. The battery door must be openable when the holder is fixed in position. When test-positioning components and checking illumination angles, tilt the helmet to face straight forward as it would be in use, rather than tilting down as it would sit on a table. If the headlamp has separate front and rear components connected by a cable, the position of the front light forward to back along the crown may be chosen to take up excess slack in the cable. (The cable should not be kept in tension to avoid stress to it, to avoid stress to the components, to avoid stress to flexible adhesive such as tape that it may pull loose and crooked, and because tolerances help ensure successful construction.)  , Noting the constraint of placement of the rear battery pack or light, if any, affix the front light to the helmet as you had determined to be appropriate. It must face straight ahead, so check its path in a dimly lit room and tweak its direction as the adhesive hardens (or before you firmly stick down double-sided tape). Allow adhesive to cure fully before proceeding so it stays aligned.  If the helmet does not have a suitable mounting surface, a gentle curve can be built up with double sided tape, epoxy putty, or epoxy.   If it has aerodynamic-looking tail ends of spikes at the back protruding well beyond its overall thickness, you might carefully trim these in a relatively sheltered area (not the rear extremity of the overall helmet) to create a small flat mounting area while not harming the overall structure. Epoxy is very strong and headlamp components are very light: a large mounting area is not needed.  Choose power and blink settings. Blinking lights front and back are great for being seen even when you have enough light to see. , Enjoy your ride!	Choose a bike helmet to modify. Pick out a headlamp for adaptation to the helmet. Select a suitable adhesive to stick them together. Remove the headlamp strap. Test-position the components. Mount the front light. Mount the rear light. Turn on the front and rear lights. Put on the helmet.  , Adjust the front light up or down to suit your preference.
Cut out a 100mm nylon wire and unfold it, then place the iron earring hook at the center position. Fix the earring hook by stringing one blue seed beads on each tip and then pass the wire tips cross through another one.; ,  Add three blue seed beads on each tip and cross through 6mm Abacus Glass Bead, finally tighten the wire.       At each tip, string one 6mm Abacus Glass Bead and then cross through the 8mm Round Glass Bead.       Repeat the first action; just replace the blue seed beads with the silver ones.       Add on another one silver seed bead on each, then pick up the two wire tips and pull it and through the wire across to the starting Abacus Glass Bead.  When turn to the last part of the semi-finish crystal earrings, the detailed beading methods are just as same as the step2: add beads and cross through the shared beads.  So far, the above are all steps necessary in making your own earring at home!  ,	Add on the iron earring hook for your crystal earrings. Make the dangling part of crystal earrings. Complete the back part of the dangling part. By the end of the dangling crystal earrings, just tie a knot is OK!, Finished.
Use toothpicks for where the holes will be. Ensure your shapes are completely dry before applying the ART CLAY SILVER paste. TIP: Make your shapes a few days before you make your beads. To dry out the cork completely place the shapes in the warmest place you can find, e.g the dash of your car is a good place. The shapes will feel very light when dry. (See image cork forms.) , Use the hairdryer to dry paste in between each layer. (See image painting on clay paste)., This depends on how thick you are applying each layer. Bead should have a nice weighty feel to it. TIP: Make sure you keep your coats even. You don’t want thin areas as these may sink in when firing. Make sure you paint the clay right up to the toothpicks., Leave the area you want syringed uncoated. (See image Filigree heart), TIP: Don’t sand to much as you will thin the layers you have applied., This is where your imagination takes over. Using the syringe and the synthetic stones decorate your bead. To set the stones form a donut the size of your stone using the ART CLAY SILVER syringe. Place the stone onto the donut making sure it is sitting straight. Apply another donut using the syringe on top of the stone.(See image Setting Stone)., When you have completed decorating the bead use the hair dryer to completely dry your bead. TIP: To tell if your bead is dry place it on a small compact mirror. If there is condensation on the mirror then your bead is not completely dry. Continue drying until there is no condensation., Remove toothpicks from your bead before firing. If you are using a portable camp hotplate take it outside to fire as the cork gets very smoky when firing away. If firing indoors on your cook top have the range hood on hi and keep the room well ventilated. The cork will take a little longer to fire away than firing just clay. Approx. 5-10 minutes. (See image Firing)., You now have a hollow bead., (See image Brushing), This brings out the bright shine of the silver. On this heart bead I have only burnished the syringe work and left the remainder with the matte finish for contrast. (See image Heart Contrast).	Form the shapes for your beads out of the Core Cork Clay.      Using the ART CLAY SILVER Paste, apply first coat to the cork form.  Keep layering on the paste and drying in between each layer until there is approximately 8-10 layers. If making the heart bead that has a filigree corner, don’t coat the entire bead. When you have completed coating your bead and it is completely dry give it a light sand with a very fine sandpaper. Decorate your bead. Using the ART CLAY SILVER syringe continue to decorate your bead. Once your bead is completely dry you are ready to fire it. Rinse your bead under cold water and rinse all the cork ash from the middle. Brush your bead with the stainless steel brush to remove clay residue. Burnish your bead using the burnisher.
The 'budget' but classy way to do this is, to make one simple poster with white writing and a black background and get someone who works in an office to photocopy it as much as possible. Otherwise, you will have an extra cost for printing. Put the following on the poster   Headlining Band Band on before them Opening band Location Date Cost Any and all websites relating to bands, venue, tickets, you etc.  Put them up in music stores, local youth hangouts, Internet cafes, schools/colleges (if allowed) and modern clothes shops.  and tell them that the gig is on. Give them all the information you have on the poster, or even post them a copy of the poster. Write a Press Release, and send it to newspapers in your area, and the area of the gig, a few weeks before the gig. Try to get the newspaper to send a photographer if they have an 'Out& About' section or similar.  Try to set up your own account dedicated to your organising gigs if you are really serious.	Make posters. Put the posters up everywhere, but always ask permission before putting them up. Ring your local newspaper/radio-station/etc. Get all the bands to put the gig on their Myspace/Bebo/Blogger, or whatever.
If the rust only showed through the chrome in pinpricks, drying the surface with a towel after cleaning may be enough to keep up the chrome's appearance.  Apply a wax or polish to the chrome to protect it from any further damage. Use a product only for its intended purpose, such as car wax for chrome-plated vehicles.   Typically, wax is applied, buffed and left to dry, then a second layer is applied over it and buffed again.  This will keep a nice shine on the chrome, but the level of rust protection depends on the brand of paint and how well it is applied. Select a paint appropriate to the task, typically automotive paint, and apply as evenly as possible over areas pitted by rust damage. Use a fine, 1200 grit sandpaper to smooth it down after it dries, taking care to avoid sanding unpainted areas.  This is an expensive option, usually only performed on cars that were severely damaged by rust. Hire a mechanic who offers a chrome plating service if you want to re-chrome your car. If you're feeling ambitious, you can try to chrome plate objects at home, especially if they are relatively small.	Buff and dry the surface. Protect the metal using polish or wax. Apply silver paint. Get the object re-chromed.
You'll need a power drill, a dozen craft sticks, paint and brush (optional), a photograph (optional), a craft knife, glue, water, and embroidery floss.  Do this for the rest of your craft sticks. Make sure all the holes are drilled at the same spot on all the sticks.   Use caution when cutting with a power drill. Wear eye protection and do the cutting on a flat surface.  This will be the top of your fan and will spread out more than the base.  Allow them to dry thoroughly.   You may find that some colors, particularly reds, will need 2 or even 3 coats.  Make sure the sticks are touching, without any gaps in between them.  Enlarge a photograph or cut a magazine photo to the size of the sticks you measured. Make sure your image is the exact same size of the sticks when touching.  The image should completely fit over the sticks. If sticks are still visible at the sides, you should enlarge or cut a bigger image. If your photo hangs over the side of the sticks, you need to trim the image down.  Use a craft knife to score the picture lightly along the sides of each stick.  This will help keep them in order after cutting. Make sure you're numbering the back of the photo and not the picture itself.  Use a craft knife to ensure a neat, straight cut. Hold a ruler tightly against the cutting line and slide the knife along the edge of the ruler, pressing hard enough to cut through the picture.   Be extremely careful when using the craft knife.  In a small container, mix equal parts of craft glue and water.  You'll need to brush the glue mix on the back of one picture strip. Center the strip on a stick, and brush a thin coat of the mixture on all sides of the stick and picture. Repeat this for the remaining strips and sticks. Let them dry completely.  You can check to make sure your image is correct, by spreading the sticks back out to see if they're in order.  Tie a knot in embroidery floss or 1/8-inch (.32 cm) ribbon. Thread the other end through the holes that are 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom of the sticks. Tie a knot to secure the bottom of the fan.  Spread the tops of the sticks so they lie next to one another and tie a knot in the floss while the fan is open.  Add a dot of glue to the knots and let them dry completely before opening and closing your fan.	Get your supplies ready. Drill a small hole about 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom your craft sticks. Drill another hole about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the other end on each craft stick. Paint the sticks with acrylic or tempera paint (optional). Lay your craft sticks side by side and measure the length and width. Prepare your image. Set the photo over the sticks. Gently trace lines along the photo. Flip the photo over and number the spaces. Cut the photo into strips. Prepare your adhesive. Apply the photo strips to the craft sticks. Stack the sticks in order with the holes aligned. Thread the bottom of your fan. Thread the top of your fan. Secure your knots.
On the whole, oleanders are low-maintenance plants that don’t need regular pruning. However, you should aim to do a major pruning of your oleander at least once a year during late summer or early fall. This pruning will help you shape your plant and stimulate healthy growth.Pruning at this time won’t interfere with the blooming of the plant, because it is after the plant has already bloomed for the season. Don’t prune past October. Pruning too late can make the recently cut sections of the plant vulnerable during winter.; , It’s essential to wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Oleander is poisonous, and while for the most part it’s only dangerous when ingested, it can cause skin irritation and inflammation when handled. That is why it’s best to wear gloves when pruning or handling the plant.You may also consider wearing goggles if you have sensitive skin or eyes. Be aware that the toxin in oleander is primarily in the sap of the plant.  New shoots, also called suckers or basal shoots, are offshoots of the plant that grow up out of the base of the plant. Use sharp gardening shears to snip them as close to the base as you can. You can also dig up the dirt around the shoot and tear them out of the ground to remove them.These shoots can be harmful to the overall health of the plant because the plant will start to dedicate its energy into maintaining the shoot, rather than investing all its energy in the oleander.  If your oleander is too tall and its size is a problem, you will want to cut it down to size. Since pruning oleander actually encourages growth and branching, cut stems at half the desired height of the plant. For instance, if you’d like your oleander to be four feet tall, cut stems at two feet. Your oleander will continue to grow, and will reach four feet when the branches grow in.If your plant is more or less the size you’d like, you do not have to do any drastic cuts.  After cutting the stems to the desired heights, decide if you want to change the overall shape of the plant. When cutting branches, make your cut with sharp gardening shears just above the leaf nodes. The nodes are the sections where three leaves come out from the branch. Cutting just above the nodes encourages flowering.Your plant may have some scraggly or overhanging branches that distract from the natural shape of the plant. Cut these branches to emphasize the natural shape of the plant. You can also reshape the oleander into more of a tree-shape by cutting off branches near the bottom of the plant, leaving the area around the base clear.	Prune in late summer or early fall. Wear gloves. Snip off new shoots at the base of the plant. Cut oleander stems to about half height you’d like for the overall plant. Shape your oleander.
Make a pile of stuffed animals, a pile of dolls, a pile of board games, a pile of art supplies, and so on. Making a pile of your child's absolute favorite toys may be a good idea, too., Square or cubby shelving could work well, and clear plastic bins allow the child(ren) to see the contents of a particular container. (Make sure you measure both shelving and bins so you can be sure the bins will fit.) Label bins, too, if your child is old enough to read., You might not be able to fit all the stuffed animals, for instance, into a single container. If this is the case, divide this category further; for instance, into "Dogs and Cats" and "Other Critters.", If a child plays with a certain toy every day, they probably won't want to pull out a bin from the shelves over and over again. A toy box  could be a good solution.	Sort everything in the playroom into categories. Get containers and shelving. Split larger categories into smaller categories. Consider getting a toy box for your child's favorite toys.
Many main route establishments, especially rest stops and designated “trucker” stops, will have special parking spaces intended specifically for large vehicles, like semis and moving trucks. Be on the lookout for places such as these, as this kind of parking will make your job much easier. Some semi-trucks can need as much as four times the space used by a normal sized car.You might want to plan your route well in advance so that you know where you can park easily while on your trip. A few popular sites that give comprehensive resources on roadway information are:  http://www.truckstops.com/ http://www.cdljobs.com/resources/trip-planning http://longhauler-usa.com/    , Due to the fact that your large vehicle can block the view of smaller ones and sometimes create a dangerous blind spot on the road, there are laws in place to prevent this from happening. These laws will vary between state and country, but generally you should never:   Park on a road with a speed limit over 30 mph (48 kph) unless your vehicle is disabled. Park in a way that blocks the view of the road from driveways and other streets. Park with your vehicle facing opposite the direction of traffic., When you are forced to stop on the side of a road due to mechanical issues or some other problem, you must place emergency warning devices no later than ten minutes after coming to a stop. Different kinds of roads will require different placement of your warning devices, such as:   On or near a one-direction street or a divided highway, you will need to place your warning devices at 10, 100, and 200 feet (3, 30.5, and 61 m) behind your vehicle. On a two-lane road with traffic that moves in either direction, or on an undivided highway, you should place warning devices 10 feet (3 m) in front of and behind the front and rear corners of your vehicle and 100 feet (30.5 m) ahead of and behind your vehicle. On bends, curves, and hills that obstruct the view of your warning devices, you’ll need to place your rearmost device so it can be clearly seen before the sight obstruction., Smaller parking lots and residential areas are built with smaller vehicles in mind. The best way you can gauge the space of these places is by stepping out of your vehicle and getting a clear look of your surroundings.If possible, you should make use of a spotter, who can direct you as you move into the spot safely., Larger vehicles are much heavier than your average sedan. If your vehicle were to experience a critical brake failure, its weight would make it even more dangerous to others if it started to roll. You can easily prevent this from happening by always using your parking break as an extra safety measure.	Make use of designated large vehicle parking. Know the legal expectations for large vehicles. Signal emergency stops soon after occurring. Make a physical check of potential parking spots. Use your parking break always.
Determining if you're an alto or soprano or somewhere in the middle(sopralto) will help you find a song. Choose a song that best suits your voice. And if you DO choose a song that is too high or too low for you to be very good at it- just edit! The judges won't care if it's the EXACT way the original singer does it. If you sound good is what matters the most.; , This is optional, but it would be nice if you chose an outfit, makeup, etc. that looks nice. If you're performing with a group- matching outfits attract the judges attention.  You can sing your song a Capella(without music) but having music is nice too. You can burn a karaoke version of your song on a CD and have it played while you sing. Or even better maybe you or a friend can play a musical instrument and play the music for the song.  It'll be very important to practice in front of people, like your family or friends. Ask them for constructive criticism on how to prepare. Don't let them tell you you're already great, ask them how you can improve until you get it perfect!  , It's the day of the talent show. Avoid drinking milk.(Bad for singing) Do some vocal warm-ups like singing the scales up and down. Practice you're song again a couple times(Not to many! Don't want to strain your throat!).  Wave to the audience or introduce yourself before you start. If you find out you have stage fright then there are a couple techniques you can do. For me personally, imagining the crowd in their underwear doesn't work. Find a friend or family member in the audience and focus on their face, instead of all the strangers watching you. If there is someone out there smiling or wishing you good luck that's great too! Focusing on a loved one makes me feel more comfortable. While you sing, dance or you hand motions. Even if it's a slow song, it wouldn't be a bad idea to walk around the stage a bit. And most of all, enjoy it! No one wants you to feel pressured or uncomfortable about performing.  If it had been your friends who helped you practice, or your mom who bought your outfit. Thank the crowd for watching. It's common courtesy and many people will appreciate it.	Choose your song. Put some effort into your appearance. Choose how to sing the song. Practice. Know what to avoid and do prior to the show. During your performance, be crowd friendly!, After your performance, be sure to thank anyone who has helped you.
For turning spirals in a vice, a cylindrical metal stick or rod is used. The rod has a slit on one end, matching the thickness of the wire and a lever for turning it on the other end.       The rod is secured between 2 hardwood blocks with grooves according cut in them according to the grooves.                 The diameter of the rod dictates the diameter of the spiral. An alternative method would be to use a threaded rod with a slit and some nuts. The nuts would be turned onto the rod and fastened in the vice. The rod could be turned by turning 2 nuts onto the rod and tightening them against each other, after that the rod could be turned with vice grips, pliers or with a suitable wrench. A lathe with a metal or wood cylinder in it could also be used in place of the rod. The wire could be wound onto the cylinder by turning the lathe by hand or at very low RPM. Optionally, the wire could be guided through a stack of 2 pieces of wood to straighten the wire.  Adjust the threading density and spacing according to what kind of wire you need.  This can be difficult if the wire is thick or strong.	Use a vice. Turn the rod and wind the wire onto the rod.
Capo's are easy tools that help shift between different keys. They're usually used to play in a different key or voice, without changing the tuning. When the capo is on the first fret the low E will instead be an "F."   You'll tune the guitar into standard tuning, which is a half step lower than the first fret. Then when you remove the capo, you'll be tuned a half step lower.  Tune the first string down to an E. If you are using a piano, play an E note and match the low E string to that note. Take it slow and make sure the notes are synchronized.This can be a good technique if your tuner is not chromatic. Chromatic tuners hit all the notes including sharps and flats.  Go through each string either using a tuner, piano, or your ear. Play a standard E chord and check to see if everything sounds tuned.  After adjusting your tuning, you should now be tuned down a half step. Play an E chord after you've removed the capo., Go through each string within a chord, and make sure it sounds in tune. Rely on your ears, but you might need to use a tool.	Place the capo on the first fret. Find a tuner or a piano. Tune the rest of the guitar normally. Remove the capo. Adjust the tuning.
Turn on the amp with nothing connected to it. Slowly turn up the volume and see if you hear that buzzing noise. If you do, there may be a loose or frayed wire inside the amp. If there is no buzzing noise, you can rule out the amp as the source of the problem.   Always unplug the amp before inspecting the internal wiring. You may be able to solder a loose wire yourself if you can identify the problem. If you think the buzzing could be feedback, move farther away from the amp when you play. Failing capacitors may cause a distinctive 60 cycle ground hum, especially in tube amps.  If you haven't already, try plugging in your guitar using a different cable. An old or worn cable is a common cause of noise, although this is usually a 60 cycle ground hum rather than a buzz.  If this screw feels loose, tightening it can sometimes solve the buzzing issue. If this doesn't work, turn the guitar upside down, carefully unscrew the nut, and catch the connector. Check the connector's connections and re-solder them if necessary.   Volume controls, treble and bass controls, and any other knob can be another source of loose wiring. Remove the knobs one at a time, remove the nut holding the potentiometer in place, and inspect the wiring. Never access these areas while the guitar is face up, or the connector could drop into the body of the guitar.  Plug the cable into your guitar and wriggle it. If you feel something loose inside the instrument, there is probably a loose wire causing an electrical short. This could be at the pickups, the pots (potentiometers), or input jack. If you are up to the task, you may remove the back plate and solder the loose wire back into place. However, the soldering iron can easily damage the guitar's finish and other wiring. If you are not experienced at soldering or cannot adequately protect the surrounding area, take the guitar to a professional luthier for repair.  Depending on your model, you may need to remove the strings in order to unscrew the pickups. Once you have removed them from the guitar, check for loose connections and frayed wires. Make sure the connections are not touching any other metal objects.	Test the amp. Switch cables. Check the cable input on your guitar. Wriggle the cable to test for loose wires. Check the wiring on the pick-ups.
The easiest way to do this is to have a voice coach help you, but you can figure it out on your own. Start with a middle C on a keyboard. Play it and match it with your voice. Do this again with the next note down and continue until you reach a note you cannot sing without straining your vocal cords. This is the bottom of your range. Repeat this process going up in pitch to find the top of your range.Search online for videos of notes played up and down the keyboard if you don’t have access to a keyboard.; , Start with your normal range. Repeat a simple sound such as “la,” moving up and down your range. Master that first, touching upon notes at the high and low end of the range. Don’t linger on notes that put a strain on your throat. Focus on staying relaxed and breathing properly. Perform scales at least eight to ten times a day in practice.Continue this range practice daily until you can hit the difficult notes eight to ten times in a session.  Continue to use the scale exercise, attempting to sustain difficult notes for longer periods of time. Add in other exercises to loosen your vocal cords. Take a break whenever you feel uncomfortable. The more you reach these notes, the easier time you’ll have singing them without pain.One exercise you can add is slides. Sing a note. Instead of moving back and forth, stop at the next note. Do this for each note until you reach the end of your range. Another exercise is to grunt. Grunt to shorten your vocal cords, then sing a short word like “mom” in a note in your range. Move up or down your range each time.  Change the sounds of vowels during higher notes to put less pressure on your vocal cords. Try rounding your mouth into a loose oval shape as you speak a word such as “time.” Let your jaw drop and your tongue loosen. The “i” will take on an “ah” sound.This isn’t useful at the lower end of your range because your vocal cords are already shortened. Use scale practice exercises to reach those notes.  At first you can try singing individual words at the top of your range. Sing the word out loud, keeping the vowel sound rounded. At the end of the word, allow your throat to open so the vowel sound ends in the normal pronunciation. For example, transition back from an “ah” sound in “time” to the normal long “i” sound. As long as the normal sound returns before the next consonant, the word will still sound right to listeners.As you practice singing songs, incorporate this vowel modification into words on high notes until it becomes second nature.  When you stumble over a certain word at a tough note in the middle of a song, substitute it for a simpler word such as “noo.” Practice the song again with the substitution until you are comfortable enough hitting the note to put the original word back in.Vowel modification can be used in conjunction with word substitution, such as when substituting “thet” for “that.”  , You should always take the time to loosen your vocal cords before you start. This is necessary to reach notes on the edges of your range and avoid damaging your voice. Possible warm ups include performing trills, moving up and down your range with “me” or “oo” sounds, holding your mouth in an “o” and buzzing, and humming.For trills, place your lips together and make an “h” or “b” sound (lip trills) or place your tongue behind your upper teeth and make an “r” sound (tongue trills) as you move up and down your vocal range. You should also repeat exercises when you are finished singing to cool down your vocal muscles.  Expanding your range involves mastering the basics of singing. One of these techniques is proper breathing. Inhale deeply so the diaphragm muscle under your lungs pushes your stomach out. When you exhale to sing, bring your stomach slowly in so that you can sing longer and control your tone.Practice controlling your breath by breathing in for a set interval such as four seconds, holding for four seconds, then breathing out for four seconds. Increase the intervals as you practice. Taking in and using too much air at once won’t help you sing higher notes. Take in a single deep breath at a time and give your vocal cords a constant airflow to avoid strain.  Good posture also serves to enhance the airflow necessary to stretch your range. Plant your feet on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Allow your shoulders to relax as you straighten your back. Keep your head and neck up while singing. When you reach the notes on the outside of your range, remember to avoid tilting your head or stretching your neck.  Many beginning singers are tempted to tighten their body and strain their vocal cords to extend their range, but this is dangerous. Instead, stand firm against the floor without feeling tense. Don’t raise your muscles towards your throat when you sing. Allow your tongue and throat to stay as loose as possible. This will reduce your strain and increase your airflow, helping you reach notes on the edges of your range.One way to practice staying loose when not singing is to stick your tongue out ten times, two to three times per day.	Find your natural range. Move through your normal range. Work up to difficult notes. Round vowel sounds. Transition to normal vowel sounds. Substitute words. Warm up before you sing. Breathe properly while singing. Adopt proper posture. Relax your muscles.
Many libraries subscribe to lists that automatically send them books from certain publishers. You will want to avoid doubling up on books, or buying something that the library doesn't need.; , Many libraries make the majority of their acquisitions at the beginning of their fiscal year. This is a good time to buy books, if you are part of library staff, but if you want to donate, you may want to help out later in the year.   Ask if the library needs a purchase order for every book it purchases. Many libraries are publicly funded, and a purchase order, or PO, helps them keep track of their budget.  Friends of the Library is a common non-profit organization that helps to support library collections and presentations. They often have a fund to help the library receive books or collections they need most.  Most libraries put an emphasis on acquiring very new books; however, they may also be in need of replacements for lost or stolen copies.  Most libraries prefer library-bound or hardcover books because they stand up to more circulation than paperback books.   Library bound books are bound with extra stitching and a hardcover, but are often less decorative than the original covers. Most library bindings are made through a special service, although some publishers have started to provide library bindings.  Libraries aim to keep copies of new books on hand for patron use, so they often pay the full price from the publisher. Library binding also adds money onto the process, which the library hopes will add value with further readings. Few new releases are acquired for less than $25 (18 euros, 16 pounds).  Book stores and even Amazon.com often give a discount to libraries and schools.  Some small to mid-sized libraries have Amazon accounts that receive an extra discount. If you go onto this site, you can buy books from their wish list.  Unlike other book purchases, sometimes payment is required within 30 days of receipt of the books. This allows the library to put it into the system.  If the book is not library bound, ask if you should arrange for a library binding to complete your library book purchase.	Inquire about the library's book buying process. Arrange to buy books according to the library's fiscal year. Contact the "Friends of the Library" organization. Ask for a current list of books the library needs to acquire. Consult the library on whether they prefer hardcover, paperback or library bound books. Understand that library books are often more expensive than privately bought books. Inquire where the library buys their books. Ask the publishing company if they can send the library the book before receiving payment. Buy the books that fit within your library's criteria.
Taking classes and practicing your craft as often as possible will increase the chances that you'll impress a casting director. Take feedback from auditions into account and work as hard as you can to improve, then try again. It might take dozens of auditions before you land a role, but every time you act in front of a casting director, you're getting valuable practice.  You can single yourself out from the other actors by demonstrating your other talents if they are relevant for the role. Knowing how to sing, dance, play an instrument, play a sport, and so on can give you an edge. Don't be afraid to break into song during an audition if you think it will help your chances.  A talent agent would be responsible for finding roles suitable for your style and experience level, eliminating the need for you to track down roles on your own. Casting directors often send talent agents descriptions of the type of actor they're looking for, and talent agents then notify the casting directors if they're representing someone who would be a good fit. Working with a talent agent is a good way to get an "in" after you've gotten some experience under your belt.   If you go this route, be sure you're working with an experienced, licensed agent. Some people pose as talent agents to prey on vulnerable young actors. You can expect to pay your agent 10% of your earnings. You can find an agent by attending a casting workshop, during which you would audition in front of both agents and casting directors. Do an online search for workshops in your area. The Call Sheet is a list of talent agents of good repute. Check out the list and contact agents directly., Becoming a member of SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors' labor union, can give you access to higher paying and higher profile work. It also provides health insurance and ensures your work isn't used illegally.	Act as much as possible. Hone various skills and talents. Consider finding a talent agent. Get a SAG-AFTRA card.
Heavy consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in the development of peptic ulcers.If you have been diagnosed with an ulcer, continued consumption of alcohol can contribute to irritation of ulcers and you should avoid it if you have an ulcer. This is especially true for strong alcohol and liquors.Alcohol can also lead gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach, that can severely impact the amount of time it will take for an ulcer to heal., Much like certain foods, caffeine can contribute to an increase in the secretion of stomach acid, which in turn increases the likelihood of your ulcer becoming irritated. Many stimulants have this effect and are best avoided when you have an ulcer. Caffeine is found in a wide variety of drinks such as coffee, tea, energy drinks and soda, so be sure to check the label if you're uncertain.It is thought that even decaffeinated coffee can increase stomach acid production. So it may be best to avoid even decaffeinated coffee., Quit smoking and avoid second-hand smoke. The chemicals in cigarette smoke can weaken the stomach lining, which irritates current ulcers or may even cause new ulcers to develop. Similar to other stimulants, nicotine may contribute to an increase in the production of stomach acid, which can irritate an ulcer. Nicotine can also lead to inflammation which hampers the healing process., Although there is an uncertain correlation between stress and ulcer pain, some ulcer sufferers find that when emotional stress in their life rises, so does the ulcer irritation. A program that reduces stress may have beneficial consequences and help you avoid irritating your ulcer. Try regularly practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation or tai chi.   Some research suggests that a formal stress reduction program with a class might be more effective for those with an ulcer than doing it at home alone.	Reduce consumption of alcohol. Cut down on caffeine. Avoid nicotine. Reduce stress.
Music paper has five lines and four spaces in between. If you don't have any music paper, just draw five evenly spaced horizontal lines with a ruler. Make sure to draw the lines neat if you don't have music paper,so it comes out right       ; , Make sure it's intersecting all of the lines from the music paper. It should be a little longer, so that it hangs off both ends.  Draw a semi-circle at the top of the vertical line that ends at the second horizontal line down. Now it should look like a long and skinny "P".  This new line should curve around the other side of the vertical line and intersect it again at the last horizontal line.  You're essentially making a semi-circle that's slightly smaller than the previous one. Make it so that the top goes a little over the third horizontal line.  The spiral should end on the second (from the bottom) horizontal line, which indicates the note "G".  Go to the end of the first line you drew, and draw a little line going off of it as shown.	Get a piece of music paper. Draw a vertical line. Make the line a "P". Continue across the vertical line and make another semi-circle. Continue to make the previous semi-circle into a spiral. Finish the spiral. Draw a tail at the end. Finished.
If the degreaser alone didn’t work, or you feel you need to deodorize a bit, you can mix ⅜ cup of warm water, 1 tablespoon of baking soda, ½ teaspoon of flour, and ⅛ cup of sea salt to make a cleaning paste. Add all of the ingredients to a bowl and mix until you have a paste.  The baking soda paste provides a bit more friction than most degreasers. This can help if you have a stain that requires a lot of scrubbing. Use a rag, or preferably a microfiber towel, to scrub the paste into the affected spot. If it is a small spot, or a spot with a lot of crevices you can use a toothbrush to better scrub the area.  Use a wet towel or microfiber towel to wipe away the cleaning solution and the grease. For this you need only use water, distilled water is best as it contains fewer contaminants that might leave water spots.  If the stain isn’t completely removed after the first cleaning, repeat this process until the stain is gone.	Mix up a baking soda paste. Scrub the affected area with your paste. Remove the paste with a wet towel. Repeat this process.
The average maturation time is between 43 and 50 days. By that time, there should be at least 6 leaves on each of your spinach plants. Pick baby spinach leaves from all the plants, so that every plant will keep growing to maturity.  When bolting, the spinach will begin to form a center stalk. If this happens, your spinach will be tough and bitter. Remove large developed leaves and remove any brown, withered or diseased leaves to prevent your spinach from bolting too early. You can start picking leaves as soon as they are big enough to eat.  Once your spinach plants have at least 4 true leaves, add some organic fertilizer to the soil. The spinach will not only grow faster, it will taste sweeter.	Harvest your spinach when it matures. Prevent your plants from bolting. Add fertilizer to encourage new growth.
Copyrights to a song are usually held by two separate entities. The first entity you will have to obtain clearance from is the owner of the sound recording copyright. This will usually be the record company that recorded the song for the artist.To find the owner of this copyright, start by locating the record company that is currently releasing the source music (i.e., the music you want to sample). If you have CDs, you can usually look on the back of the CD case and find the record label logo. If you have downloaded the song, you may have to look online for this answer. This task may be complicated by the fact that record companies often close and/or sell their copyrights to other companies. In other circumstances, copyrights may revert back to the original artists after a period of years.; , The second entity you will have to track down is the owner of the song itself. This will usually be the artist or a publishing company.If the owner is the artist, do an online search in order to find the artist's contact information. In most cases, this will be their management team or their lawyer. If you need to track down the publishing company, try the following:Locate the publisher through performing rights organizations. For example, visit the websites for Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) or the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).If you are using the BMI site, you can use their searchable database to find the source song. If you cannot find the source song online, call the organizations and ask for their "song indexing" department., Once you track down both parties, you will need to get their permission to use the source song. Every copyright owner will do things differently. Some copyright owners are happy to clear samples and even encourage the practice.However, some owners will not negotiate with you unless you are signed to a record deal.   In addition, every copyright owner will likely want to hear a sample of your music with the source song incorporated to get an idea of how you are going to use it., If you reach a deal with both the copyright owners, be sure you draft and execute a valid written agreement. This agreement will set out the music you are sampling, how you can sample it, and how much you are paying for the licensing rights to the source song.   This agreement will protect you in case you are ever sued for copyright infringement.  The fee you will have to pay to the copyright owners will depend on a number of factors. The first thing you will have to think about is whose music you are sampling. The more well known artists will often demand a higher fee, if they allow you to sample their music at all. Conversely, less well known artists may not charge a fee at all. In addition, it is usually cheaper to license a small piece of a song than it is to sample an entire chorus.   For example, if you want to sample a Rolling Stones song, it will probably cost you a lot of money. On the other hand, if you want to sample a relatively unknown artist's song, it may not cost you anything. Also, it will probably cost you a lot of money to sample an entire Madonna chorus, as opposed to sampling an obscure drum beat from one of her less known songs., The amount of the source song you use will also dictate how much you have to pay. For example, if you are only using a one-second drum loop, you may not have to pay too much money. On the other hand, if you are using the entire source song's bass line, you may be charged more for permission.It is important to have an idea of exactly what you are going to do with the source song before you ask for clearance. The downside, however, is that if you do not get permission a lot of hard work will have been wasted., The final piece of the puzzle is determining how you will use the source song in your music. The more prevalent the source song is, the more money you will have to pay to use it. For example, if you are going to use the source song as a part of a five-second introduction to your song, you may not need to pay that much to use it. However, if you plan on using the source song's drum loop as your drum loop throughout, you may have to pay a larger fee. In other words, it will usually cost more to build an entire song around the sample, as opposed to only giving it minor attention., When you are negotiating an acceptable fee with the copyright owners, they may accept a flat fee for the use of their song. When you offer a buy-out fee (i.e., flat fee), you are offering to pay them once for permission to use their song. These fees can range from $250 to $10,000 depending on the circumstances. Most fees will fall between $1,000 and $2,000.Remember that you will have to pay both copyright owners in order to secure clearance. Both parties will usually want an up-front fee for the use of their song., The mechanical royalty rate is the amount of money you have to pay the copyright owner to make a copy of the song. If you agree to a licensing agreement and have to pay a percentage of the mechanical royalty rate, you will usually pay between 1/2 ¢ and 3 ¢ for every record you put out that uses the sample., You may also be able to negotiate to pay the copyright owners a percentage of your song's income or a "rollover." If you agree to pay the copyright owners a percentage of your song's income, it will usually be between 5% and %50 depending on the circumstances. If you agree to a "rollover" payment, you are agreeing to pay the copyright owner a fee when a certain number of copies of your song are sold., Whatever payment option you agree to, it needs to be included in your written agreement. It should be laid out in specific terms so there is no confusion. In a lot of circumstances, you may have to pay multiple types of fees for the use of one source song.   For example, you might agree to pay a flat fee as well as a mechanical royalty.  There are businesses devoted to negotiating and securing sample clearances. These firms often charge less than entertainment attorneys and have the specific expertise you are looking for.If you use a clearance expert, they will listen to your music and review your use of the source song. From there they will inform you of how much it will probably cost you to license the source song's use.   These experts will usually charge an hourly fee for their work. These experts will know the process, the costs, and the key players in the business. You will save a lot of time and money by hiring one.Conduct an online search for sample clearance experts in your area. If you have friends in the music business, ask them for advice.  If you think you need legal advice above and beyond that of sample clearance, you may need to hire an entertainment attorney. Entertainment attorneys can help you if you are being sued for copyright infringement, if you are trying to negotiate a settlement with a record company, or if you do not think you need to get a source song cleared. If you have friends in the music business, ask if they can recommend a good entertainment lawyer specializing in music copyrights.  If you can not get any valuable recommendations from friends and family, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. Every state has a service you can use to get in contact with qualified attorneys in your area. When you call, they will ask you a series of questions about your legal issue and in turn they will provide you with a series of qualified attorney contacts.  When you have a small list of qualified lawyers, conduct initial consultations with each of them. During your initial consultation, you should explain your legal issue and ask questions of the lawyer. In return, the lawyer will give their opinion and attempt to sell you on their services. When you speak to each lawyer, ask some of the following questions:   Whether they have ever handled similar cases to yours, and if so, what the outcome was. Whether they have malpractice and liability insurance. Whether they have been practicing in the area long and how many relationships they have with individuals that may become involved in your case (e.g., other lawyers, judges, record label executives). Whether they have any history of discipline from the state bar.  After your initial consultations, sit down and analyze your options. Weigh the pros and cons of each lawyer. At the end of the day, you want to hire a lawyer you can trust and who can effectively manage your case. When you make a decision, contact your first choice as soon as possible and let them know you would like to hire them.   Be sure you get a representation agreement in writing when you first hire your lawyer. This agreement should set out what tasks the lawyer is going to complete for you and how they are going to charge for their service.  A copyright protects the creators of original works and incentivize the creation of these artistic pieces. When someone holds a copyright to a piece of work, they can, among other things, choose to sell, lease, or lend their rights to others.If you use a sample without clearance, you may be the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit. If you are the subject of an infringement lawsuit and lose, you may be liable for:Statutory damages, which are damage awards set by law. For copyright infringement cases, you may be required to pay anywhere from $500 to $20,000 for a single act. In addition, if you infringed on the copyright willfully, damages can be as much as $100,000. Also, a court may issue an injunction forcing you to stop using the source song. This might include recalling all of your albums using the source song and destroying them.  Sample clearance may not be required in every scenario where a source song is sampled. For example, if you are using a sample in your own home and do not reproduce or sell your music, you may be able to sample freely. In addition, if you are playing live shows, you may be able to sample music without getting clearance. This is usually the case because live venues will pay blanket license fees to performing rights agencies., If you use a sample without getting clearance and you are sued for infringement, you may be able to raise certain defenses to protect your rights to use the source song. Two common examples of defenses include "fair use" and "non-infringement."   You may be able to argue that your use of the source song is not an infringement because an average listener would not be able to hear any substantial similarities between your music and the sampled song. You might also attempt to argue you should not be liable for infringement because your use of the source song constitutes fair use. In order to successfully argue this in court, you will need to be able to show that your use of the source song was for a limited purpose (e.g., educational use, for critical use, or for a parody). Courts will usually look to see how much of the original work you used, how you transformed the work, and whether you caused the copyright owners any financial harm., Interesting situations can come up if you have a record contract or if you are using the sample for selling or endorsing a product (i.e., in an advertisement). If you have a record contract, some provisions in it will usually require you to promise that all the music you create is yours. If you break this promise and the record company is sued for copyright infringement, you will usually be responsible for reimbursing the record company for the costs associated with that litigation.If you are using a sample in an advertisement and the sampled artist is recognizable, you will need to get the source artist's permission to use the song. This is because the advertisement might create the impression that the artist is endorsing the product. If you do not get the artist's permission, they can sue you for the violation of their "right of publicity."	Track down the sound recording copyright owner. Find the owner of the song. Negotiate a clearance agreement with both parties. Secure a written agreement. Consider the music you are sampling. Determine how much of the sample you intend to use. Define how you intend to use the sample. Offer a flat fee. Pay a percentage of the mechanical royalty rate. Consider other payment options. Include this in your clearance agreement. Find a sampling consultant. Ask your friends and family for attorney recommendations. Contact your state bar association. Conduct initial consultations. Hire the most qualified lawyer. Consider basic copyright laws. Know when sample clearance may not be required. Defend your use of the sample. Research less common scenarios.
Determine if a blaster is right for your needs. If your paint covers a large area, then a blaster may be a better choice over a paint stripper solution. One form of blasting is soda blasting, which uses baking soda as the scouring agents. Soda blasting is also much more environmentally-friendly than using chemicals, and will not damage the concrete underneath.  To soda blast, you will need a pot blaster. Your local hardware store may be able to rent them to you. You will also need special sodium bicarbonate. The baking powder that you buy at the grocery store is too fine to use in a soda blaster. The proper powder should be available where you rent the blaster, but can also be ordered online.          Most standard sand blasters cannot work with soda. You will need to obtain a specialized soda blaster in order to use sodium bicarbonate.  Work slowly, holding the nozzle about a foot and a half away from the ground. Be sure to wear a respirator to avoid inhaling particles. Move the nozzle evenly across the painted area to make sure that no paint gets left behind.          If blasting near vegetation, be sure to avoid getting excess particles on plants. The high pH soda can cause browning and death in flowers and bushes. If you have a lot of paint to remove, consider hiring a professional blaster. The amount of blasting material needed and the size of the blasting unit will most likely be far too much to afford on your own.	Consider soda blasting. Obtain a blasting unit. Blast the painted area.
If you don’t have an office or a study, don’t worry. You don’t need to store all of your books in one room. Feel free to spread your collection throughout your house.   For example, keep all of your cookbooks in the kitchen. , You can display your organized book collection in a variety of ways. You may store your books on shelves or ledges. You can also stack your books in storage cubes.   For a more eclectic look, consider stacking your books on the floor, in a dormant fireplace, or down the edge of your staircase., Once you’ve settled on a location and storage method, you can finally put away your collection. Place the books on your bookshelves or stack the books in a storage cube.   Before you shelve or stack your books, you may want to clean and dust your storage unit.  For convenience, frequently used books should be readily accessible. This is especially important if children will be using the books.   If children are using the collection, store the books at their level. Instead of a traditional shelf, consider a storage system that would allow them to stack the books. Lastly, you may also want to store the books in the places they will use them the most, such as a playroom or bedroom., If you don’t have the space to display your entire collection, you may need to put some of your books in storage. To protect your books while they’re in boxes, follow these tips:   Stack your books horizontally with the heaviest books on the bottom. To fill in gaps, insert books vertically. Never place a book spine down. If possible, try not to stack more than three boxes of books on top of each other., If your collection contains rare books, you may wish to take extra steps to protect these special items. It is good practice to apply all of these suggestions to your entire collection.   Store your rare books out of direct sunlight. In addition to fading the book jacket, the sunlight will slowly deteriorate the book. Keep your books in their dust jackets. Before shelving or storing a book, always remove bookmarks and scraps of paper. Try to store your books at a consistent temperature. Too much humidity will generate mold in your books; too little humidity will leave your books brittle.	Choose a location for your collection. Settle on a storage method. Stack or shelve your books. Make books you use often accessible. Box and label excess books you want to keep. Protect rare, delicate, or important books.
Before you start shopping around, it's important to be able to understand the basic components of a turntable. Make sure that you fully understand the features and can compare the advantages and disadvantages of different brands, models, and styles of turntable.A basic turntable or record player consists of:   A record platter or plate, which is a record-sized circle on which the vinyl record will sit. The platter rotates to spin the record, and is often covered with an anti-static felt or rubber pad on which the record will sit. The stylus of the record player is also sometimes referred to as the "needle," and is the component of the record player that contacts the record itself. The stylus is usually housed in a cartridge, which contains the small wiring and coupling mechanism that connects the stylus to the tone arm. A tone arm can be operated manually or automatically, rotating the stylus onto the record. Good record players will have tone arms that will lift off automatically and return to place when the end of the side is finished playing. The base of the record player contains the internal circuitry and houses the various components. Ideally, turntable bases are secured on anti-shock feet to keep the record from skipping during play.; , Turntables can be divided into two basic categories, in terms of the way that they're operated. For the beginner, the difference may be minuscule, but it's important to understand the different machine-styles, depending on the way you intend to use your turntable.   Direct-drive turntables offer consistent machine-operated speeds that will never need adjusted, and allow dual-directional rotation. If you have any interest in analog DJ “scratching,” you need to buy a direct-drive turntable, or you’re going to be disappointed. Belt-driven turntables isolate the motor to one side of the machine, rotating the platter with an elastic belt. While the belt has a tendency to wear out over time in old turntables, the distance of the motor from the tone arm cuts down on incidental operating noise, making these models whisper-quiet.  Some turntables are basically a platter and a needle, with few frills or other features. Lots of modern turntables, however, come with a variety of different features that can make a unit more desirable and convenient.   Most turntables should come with a variety of playback speeds, measured by revolutions-per-minute (RPM). Most 12-inch records (large, LP sized) are played at 33 1/3 rpm, while smaller 7-inch singles are played at 45. Old shellac and acetate discs made pre-1950 are usually played at. If you want to play all kinds of records, you'll need to make sure the unit features all these playback speeds.USB ports are a feature on many new turntables, which allow you to direct-line in your record player to your computer and record digital files of your vinyl records. If you've got a big collections of vinyl you want to digitize, these are essential. Tone-arm cueing systems are available in manual and automatic varieties. Some record players are operated by sliding a switch or pressing a button, which activates the tone arm and drops it gently onto the record, while other record players need to be placed onto the groove manually. Automatic cueing systems are very desirable for beginners, since you won't have to fumble around with the delicate stylus. Anti-shock stabilization systems are excellent, especially if you want to take your record player anywhere for DJing events, or keep your record player in a heavy-traffic room. There's nothing worse than a skipping record.  Some cheap turntables are impossible to get apart, meaning that if a stylus breaks you'll have to scrap the whole unit. Because record players will wear out over time and suffer in terms of sound quality, buying a unit that you'll be able to upgrade is a smart choice. Most mid-range units should allow you to customize the belts, stylus, and the platter, if necessary.   Alternatively, if you’re not interested in making a long-term purchase, cheaper and flimsier turntables can be a good budget option. When it wears out, it’ll just be worn out, but you can get some use out of it in the meantime.  Like anything, more expensive turntables are generally “better” than cheaper varieties. How much better, though, depends on your own preference for sound and your intentions with your turntable. Decide how much you can spend and set a price range accordingly. From sub-$100 to high-end models in excess of $500, there are a variety of perfectly-listenable models.   A DJ looking to jump to analog live sets might be in the market for a more high-end record player capable of putting out the juice, while teenagers looking to drop a needle on dad’s old record collection probably don’t need to break the bank. If you’ve never purchased a turntable before, don’t overspend. Plenty of record snobs with room-sized collections play their deep cuts on used turntables that sound great. Save your money for vinyl.  Given the option, going big on a cartridge and spending less on a machine is always the better option. Since the stylus is the part that actual contacts the grooves, it has the most impact on the sound coming out of the speakers. As long as a turntable functions properly, it’ll sound great with a great stylus.   For comparison, a high-quality cartridge only costs about $40. While that might seem expensive for so tiny a component, if you can get away with buying a used machine with a worn out needle for less than a hundred bucks and make it sound brand new, it’s practically a steal.  Vinyl collecting comes and goes as a hobby, meaning that the market for units, records, and other record-playing equipment can vary widely in price. It's always a good idea to keep an eye on used units to look for deals on high-end equipment that someone else has gotten rid of. If you know how to inspect a record-player, this can be a great option for saving some money.   Ask for a hooked-up demonstration of a record player before you buy it. You should be able to hear it. Bring your own record, so you can be sure of the quality. Check the rotation of the platter. Platters should spin perfectly flush with the base and shouldn't warble as they spin. You can adjust this, but if you're going to spend money on a new unit, you want to make sure you're paying for what you get. A record player with worn-out belts will warble and distort sound. Inspect the quality and the pliability of the belts on a belt-driven record player to be sure the unit is solid. Belts should never be cracked and should return to their shape if stretched.  Record store clerks have an unfair reputation for snark, but try to give them a chance. Many record stores sell turntables or replacement parts, and many of the clerks will be perfectly willing to dish on local options for shopping, their preferred set-up, and other advice. You won’t know until you ask.  Most of the time, you won’t be able to just buy a turntable, slap a record on the platter and start rocking out after you plug it in. You need to run a turntable through a multi-channel tuner, or at least a good pair of speakers after running it through a pre-amp. Don't forget to figure your stereo into the equation.   Some new or portable turntables come with built-in speakers. What these lack in quality, they make up for in value. You can usually get a portable record player with no need of pre-amp, speakers, or other equipment for less than $200.  Pre-amplifiers are used to boost the sound of the record player to appropriate volumes. Most record players, new or used, will need to plug into a phono pre-amp to boost the sound, before direct-lining into the sound system. Some models feature built-in pre-armps, but both budget and high-end record players will mostly need to be paired with a pre-amp, which are available at most good electronics stores, for no more than $25-50.Built-in pre-amps make the process of setting up your record player a whole lot easier. It'll involve a lot of extra audio cables to connect your turntable to the pre-amp, then attach the preamp to the receiver.  Dust is the enemy of a record collection. If you're investing in a record player for the first time, it's important to learn to care for it and your vinyl records properly. Investing in some basic supplies will help you to keep your records clean and your stylus in good working order.A basic kit to go along with your player and your collection should include:   A felt or microfiber record brush Record cleaning fluid, which is basically a mixture of distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and detergent Anti-static record sleeves Anti-static plate pad  , 7-inch vinyl singles played at 45 rpm will sometimes have a much-larger hole in the record than a 12-inch record. These need to be played by slotting a plastic gap spacer over the spindle in the center of the record platter, which will sometimes be included with the unit and sometimes not. It's an easy thing to forget about, but it can be frustrating to end up without one if you want to play some singles. Fortunately, they're available online or at most record stores for a dollar or two.  A good record player is useless without a tasteful collection of your favorite vinyl to play on it. While budget used vinyl is widely available at second-hand record stores, antique stores, resale shops, online venues, and garage sales, there's also a burgeoning new vinyl market to explore. Vinyl's not dead.   Rocker Jack White's successful boutique label Third Man Records puts on a variety of vinyl novelties, including colored vinyl, scented vinyl, picture-discs, and vinyl that plays backward. Record Store Day is a worldwide phenomenon, and can be a great way to get out and check out local record stores in your area. In the spring of each year, hundreds of new limited-run releases are made available to the public. It's the crate-digger's Christmas. Real record collectors are known as crate-diggers and can be found thumbing through the unlabeled boxes in the bottom of libraries, book sales, and garages, looking for unfound gems and diamonds in the rough. Famous collector Joe Bussard (whose collection of 78s is larger than the Smithsonian's) used to pretend to be an exterminator so he had a reason to knock on doors and ask if people had any old records they wanted to get rid of.	Learn the lingo. Decide between a direct-drive and belt-driven record player. Decide what kind of features you want. Only consider turntables with replaceable parts. Figure out how much you’re willing to spend. Buy a good cartridge. Always inspect used turntables. Talk to record store clerks for advice. Make sure you have a good-quality stereo to use your turntable with. Purchase a phono pre-amp. Get record cleaning supplies. Get a 45 gap spacer. Get some vinyl records.
You might want to call a professional to do this due to the hazard of electrical shock. There are a couple of things you can do, however, without specialized digital equipment that is unavailable to the average DIYer.  Raise the washing machine door. You should find it on the right side near the bottom front. You will find a plastic post pointing down that aligns with a hole in the lip of the opening.   This post is the safety switch that keeps the washer from operating when the lid is up. Use a small screwdriver to push down on the switch located just below the lip under the hole with the door open and the machine in wash or spin cycle. The safety switch is good if the machine comes on. Have it replaced if it does not.  Put one probe of the continuity tester on the hot (positive) post and the other probe on the negative post.   The machine is getting electricity, and the problem is inside the control panel, if it lights up. This is when you need to call a trained professional to check it out and fix the washing machine.	Check the electrical system. Test the safety switch on the door. Use a continuity tester to see if the washer is getting electricity on the back where the electrical cord is plugged into the outlet.
There will literally be thousands of others waiting near you to get their 30 seconds, too. Parking will be limited, so if you can avoid driving, do it. And if you're a minor, bring a guardian with you.   Get there very, very early. People will be waiting in the wee hours of the morning.You may want to bring some food, drinks (water!), a chair, and something to amuse yourself.  This will most likely take all day. That's even if you've been informed to get there at 8 AM. They are seeing thousands of people and won't likely get started until everything is settled and everyone is ushered into the arena (or whatever the type of venue). Your audition will likely take place 8 or so hours after you've arrived.   Account for the weather. Your hair and makeup may not look as great as you want it to when you're auditioning at 5 PM and got there at 5 AM. Bring extra makeup and comfortable shoes. You'll be grateful you did.  Finally, the fun part! When your number is called, a team member (someone you won't recognize) will approach you and listen to you sing. You'll be doing this in front of everyone -- there is no designated, blocked-off area for singers. Take a deep breath and go big or go home.   The judge will then give you a polite yes or no. They are not allowed to critique you or give you feedback. If you do make it, you'll be notified of a call back audition at a later date.	Get there early. Be patient. Sing your heart out.
You must be fluent in both the language of the TED talk (almost always English), and the language that you are translating into.Therefore, you need to be able to capture the nuances of spoken English well enough to translate it into the target langauge.   Fluency means that you speak or read your non-native language with sufficient skill as to equal or approach the level of a native speaker of that language.; , TED talks often talk about obscure and technical subject matter. If you choose to transcribe or subtitle, you must be fluent enough in the target language to translate the jargon and cutting edge vocabulary that you'll hear.  You must familiarize yourself with and abide by subtitling best practices. You can find a list of best practices at http://www.ted.com/participate/translate/guidelines#h2--subtitling. Some important ones to be aware of include:   Putting the proper number of lines and characters in each subtitle. Making sure the reading speed for each line is not too fast or too slow. Compressing the written material while preserving the meaning.	Make sure you are sufficiently fluent in the spoken source language. Make sure you are sufficiently fluent in the target written language. Familiarize yourself with best practices.
Consult your car's owner's manual. The manual usually specifies the battery size you should buy.       Ask an auto supply store employee to help you figure out the correct battery size.      ; , Keep driving needs and climate in mind and check your owner's manual for the correct physical size. Consider group size, which refers to the outside dimensions of the battery and the placement of the terminals. If you get a battery that is too small, it won't fit securely in the battery compartment of your car.  High temperatures are hard on car batteries. The electrolyte solution in car batteries evaporates more rapidly in hot climates.       A battery with a long life is important if your daily driving habits are primarily short stop-and-start trips. Short trips don't allow very much time for your battery to recharge. A battery with a long life is better able to withstand those shorter trips.    The date stamp code gives you the battery's freshness information. The first two characters are a letter and a digit — A stands for January, B for February, etc.; the digit specifies the year the battery was manufactured — five stands for 2015, six for 2016. The date code is engraved into the cover of the battery. You can find it as you look down at the top of the battery. Some batteries may also have a sticker with the date code.  These 2 terms are critical, especially if you live in a colder climate.   CCA indicates a battery's ability to start a car in 0°F (-17°C). CCA also tells you how much current the battery delivers to your car's starter. CA tells you how much current your battery delivers to your car when temperatures are 32°F (0°C). This rating is usually higher than the CCA. A battery cost increases as the CCA increases. The CCA is relative to how much lead a battery has inside it when it is built; as the lead increases, the CCA increases.    Reserve capacity measures how many minutes the battery may run using its power alone. You need to know the reserve capacity in case your car's alternator should fail.    Maintenance free batteries do not need to have water added to them.       Low maintenance batteries are unsealed and have caps on top that allow you to add distilled water — an important consideration if you live in a hot climate.	Learn what battery size you need for your car's make and model. Pick the correct size and type of battery for your driving needs. Look for a battery that has been on the store shelf for less than six months. Ask about "cold cranking amps" (CCA) and "cranking amps" (CA). Inquire about reserve capacity for the batteries that are in stock. Check the difference between maintenance free (sealed) and low maintenance batteries.
Usually, this is an image that you want to enlarge, but it is too pixelated or low-resolution to use in its current form. You can also scan an image or drawing onto the computer using a scanner.   If you are scanning an image into your computer, increase the contrast, so that it will be easier to trace. , Select “File” and “Place” to bring your photo or image into the program. Make sure your image covers a majority of your screen, so that you can work on it in detail.  Lock the first image layer by clicking the little square lock. The image will stay in one place while you work on it.  Click on your Pen tool. You are going to trace your image, so that it will create a sharp, vector image.  Choose the weight of the line that fits the line you are going to draw. Lines that are in the foreground should be thicker, while lines in the background should be thinner.   Always use black outlines and white backgrounds during this process. You can change the colors later.  Click the second point at the end of a straight section to create a straight line. Create curved lines by clicking a second point and dragging the line until it matches the smooth curve of the image.   Use the handles to adjust the Bezier curve. They can be adjusted indefinitely. , Remember that you want to create as few points as possible, while remaining as true to the shape as possible. This is a skill that will improve with practice., You can group these elements together later on. Fill in the colors when you are finished. You can add colors on the same layer or different layers.  Save your file as a vector image, such as AI or EPS. Use this new vector image for scaling.	Find an image that you want to vectorize. Download that image to your computer desktop or into an image folder.  , Open a new Adobe Illustrator file. Add a new layer on top of your image using the Layers palette. Return to your top layer. Choose a starting point to begin drawing or outlining your image. Click the starting point with your cursor. Press “Shift” to remove the Bezier Handle when you are ready to continue your outlining or drawing.  , Continue in the same clicking and adjusting until your outline is complete. Make each separate section into a different element. Return to the first layer, unlock it and delete it when you are finished making changes.
As the cold winter months approach, it's a good idea to check your engine oil and decide whether it needs to be changed.   Dropping temperatures cause the oil in your engine to become more viscous (thicker). When this happens, the oil flows too slowly from one part of the engine to another — this prevents the engine from being properly lubricated, leading to overheating and an engine that won't start. Therefore, it is often advisable to switch to a thinner oil during the cold winter months, in order to keep your engine sufficiently lubricated. If you're unsure about what type of oil to use, check the owner's manual for more specific instructions on what type of oil is best for your specific car, under certain temperatures and weather conditions.It's also important to remember that, as a general rule, the oil in your car should be changed every 3,000 miles (4,800 km), or once every three months.  Your car's belts and hoses are susceptible to general wear and tear and are particularly affected by the cold weather.   If your car isn't due for its 30,000-mile full-service tune-up this winter (where the belts and hoses are often replaced) then it's a good idea to check them yourself for any signs of damage and get them replaced if necessary. This step should not be neglected, because if something snaps while driving, you'll have no choice but to call a tow truck — which is far from ideal in the middle of winter., It's highly important that your engine contains the correct ratio of anti-freeze to water before the cold winter months set in, otherwise the coolant could freeze, causing the engine to overheat and potentially blow a gasket.   A ratio of 50% anti-freeze to 50% water is recommended for most cars, though in some circumstances this is increased to 60% anti-freeze, 40% water. Luckily, you can buy pre-mixed bottles of anti-freeze and water at the gas station.If you're not sure about the current ratio of antifreeze to water in your car's radiator fluid, you can pick up an anti-freeze tester at your local auto parts store for relatively cheap. If the ratio is incorrect, you will need to flush your coolant system before you can refill it with the correct ratio. If this is not something you know how to do, take your car to a mechanic or oil change location. There is, however, no need to flush your system if you drain and refill on scheduled maintenance.  If your car has a 4-wheel drive function, it's important to get it checked out to ensure that it's working properly, especially if you haven't used it since the previous winter.   Have a mechanic check the 4-wheel drive to ensure that the system engages and disengages smoothly, and that the transmission and gear fluids are at the correct level. At this time, you (and any members of your household) should also review how the system works and understand the conditions under which it should be used. 4-wheel drive can improve your tires' traction on snowy or icy roads, thus decreasing your chances of getting stuck. However, this doesn't mean that you should drive any faster or less safely than you normally would in unfavorable conditions.  It's essential that your battery is in good working condition before the winter months — in cold weather, your battery takes more time to generate power, while the engine requires more current from the battery in order to start. If your battery is in poor condition, it won't be able to handle these requirements and your car will fail to start.   Keep track of how old your car battery is — they usually last between 3 to 5 years, so if yours is somewhere in that range it may be time to get a new one. You can also ask your mechanic to perform a battery load test to determine whether your battery needs to be placed. Even if it doesn't need to be replaced, you should give your car battery a once over to check for any corrosion on the battery's posts and connections and for any fraying on the cables. You also need to check the fluid level if your car is relatively old — you can do this by unscrewing the caps on top of the battery. If the fluid level is low, you can fill it with distilled water. Just be careful not to overfill it. However, most (if not all) new batteries are maintenance-free and do not require distilled water to be added. In fact, there are no caps to take off.  The defrosting and heating units on your car are essential for your visibility and comfort while driving, so it's important to ensure that they are functioning normally.   The defroster helps to clear condensation from the inside of the windshield by blowing warm, dry air onto the glass. If it's not working properly, the windows can fog up and obstruct your view of the road. Have a mechanic check the defroster to ensure that it's working properly. If you find the window is still fogging up, you'll need to check your doors and windows for air leaks that could be letting in moisture. It will become pretty obvious if your heater isn't working once the cold winter weather hits, but it's important to get this fixed as soon as possible. It may be necessary to replace the heater coil — this can be expensive, but it will be worth every cent on those cold winter mornings. It's not just your comfort that's at stake, it's also your safety. If you're too cold while driving, this may affect your steering ability and attention to the road. Having a functional heating system could also save your life if you get stranded somewhere in your car.	Change your engine oil. Check your belts and hoses. Replace old coolant with antifreeze. Make sure your 4-wheel drive is working. Check your battery. Check your defrosting and heating units.
You can form a proper ball shape by placing your hands on either side of the clay, and rotating them in a circular motion.; , Place the clay on a smooth surface and press down on it until it is flat.  Take a plastic knife or scissors and trace out the shape of an eye (simply a small circle), winking eye (a thin arch), two eyebrows (also arches, but more curved than the wink), and smile (a thick curve).  It should resemble the image above (the iPhone version)., Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool. You now have made a clay winking emoji!	Roll the yellow clay into a ball, then place it aside. Flatten your black/brown clay. Carve the facial features.  Place each facial feature onto the yellow ball until it forms a wink face. Bake the clay emoji as long as the clay package instructs.
With the most basic setup, you will need the following materials:  Three cameras on tripods, with power cords and enough memory/tape to film the entire play PLUS the time that the house opens its doors (you don't want to be setting up when the audience is already seated).        Three extension cords for camera power.       Gaffers tape (for taping down power cords). This can be purchased at target or any other hardware store.       Something to record audio with. If one of the cameras has a decent microphone, this may suffice. Otherwise, you will want to record from an external source. One way is to use an external microphone; another way is to get a direct audio feed from the house sound board (if the house has a sound board).       For more information on this topic, you may want to do a search for the following key phrase: recording audio to a camera using an external source.       Proper adapters and cables to connect to your camera's audio input from your external source (microphone, sound board, etc).       Headphones. Essential for monitoring audio.       Clapboard/Slateboard. This is essential for syncing audio and video in the editing process. To purchase one, you can Google search the following terms: film slate, clapboard, slate board       You can also follow the provided link: http://bestofferbuy.com/Action-/-Clapperboard/-Clapboard/-Film-Slate-p-67644.html?currency=USD&utm_source=gbase&utm_medium=cse&utm_campaign=gbase       A way to upload your cameras' video and audio footage to a computer.       Video editing software.      ; , Decide where to place your cameras to best capture the play. Typical three-camera configuration is as follows: Camera 1 is in the back-center of the house; Camera 2 is house right or left, closer to the stage; Camera 3 is next to the back-center camera.  Connect the power cords (and extension cords if necessary) from the camera to the outlet(s), place cords as unobtrusively as possible, then tape them down so that nobody can trip on them. , Camera 1 should be framed to capture the entire proscenium. This camera will remain in a fixed position at all times. This will be your go-to shot; if an entrance or action is not captured by any other camera, this camera should get it (unless, of course, there is an action happening in the audience!).  This camera provides another angle option on the stage. It should be positioned to capture as much of the stage as possible, while not getting any shots of the backstage (between the legs). You may keep this camera in a fixed position or have a second person operate it.  Assuming you don't have another person operating Camera 2, this will be your main active camera. You can use this to capture close-ups on stage, and even some action going on in the audience if you need to.  This should be connected to the camera that is closest to the audio source. If you are recording with a microphone, use Camera 1, as its centered placement will give you the most even audio quality.  You can do this by either using the gain indicator on the camera (if it has one) or by plugging your headphones into the camera that is receiving the audio feed. You will need an audio source such as music playing or someone talking/clapping/generally making sound. When listening, check for level and distortion. If it's too quiet turn up the mic gain; if you get distortion, turn the mic gain down.  These cameras should be recording from this point until the play is over, so make sure you have enough memory/tape.  When you use the slateboard, make sure you and the slateboard are clearly visible in ALL cameras and clearly audible to the microphone. Using the slateboard gives a visual and audio cue to be able to sync to: the point at which the sound is made is the point at which the top and bottom parts of the slateboard hit. This is necessary for syncing all three cameras and the audio to the same timeline when video editing.   NOTE: Any time you stop recording on any input source (camera or audio) and start recording again, you must use the slateboard to provide another sync point.  The actual filming of the play is actually the easiest part of the whole process. Since Cameras 1 and 2 will be in a fixed position, the only thing you need to worry about concerning them is making sure they stay on, recording, and in place the entire time. With camera 3, simply make sure you follow the center of the action.   To track your shots more easily, it helps to have a copy of the play's script. This way, you may know when and where people will be making entrances and exits.	First, let's go over materials. Camera placement. Find a power source that is close enough to each camera. Turn all cameras on, place them in standby mode, and adjust focus and iris so that all cameras match in image quality as much as possible.  , Camera 1 framing. Camera 2 framing. Camera 3 framing. Connect your audio source, using proper adapters/cables (as explained in Step 1). Check audio. Press record on all cameras. Use slateboard to make a sync point for all cameras. Filming. For more great pointers on shooting with a camera, follow the links in the "Tips" section below.
Draw a rectangular box on the paper to contain your maze and create “start” and “finish” openings in the box. Use almost the entire area of the paper; leave only a small margin along the edges.; , Draw lightly because you will eventually erase these lines.  Each cell should only connect to two other cells, and the path from the “start” cell to the “finish” cell should pass through every cell. Try to make the path through the cells counter-intuitive. , (Please refer to Figure 1 (attached) for an example of a maze with steps 1-6 complete.)  , The borders between cells should fit together like the teeth of a zipper. However, unlike a zipper, the teeth should be of variable width and length. Draw new, permanent cell boundaries. (Shown in attached figure 2.)  , The paths should be about one centimeter wide, and their borders should be the width of one line drawn with a pencil. Only draw lines that are parallel to the edges of the paper. Make every part of your maze area either a path or border between paths. Do not create any dead end paths inside cells. Consider the MTF instinct when drawing your approaches to critical points. (Refer to the large attached maze for an example of maze paths.)  , Make sure that you did not inadvertently block a critical point in your maze and that an unbroken path exists from start to finish.  Try to make sure that no spots exist where the junction of two lines is ambiguous and it is “debatable” if the path is blocked. ,	Define the maze area. Divide the maze area into 6 cells of approximately equal area. Determine the connectedness of the cells. Determine the location of the critical points that allow movement between cells.  , Erase the cell border at the critical points to form a path between the two cells. Obscure the boundaries of your cells. Draw the actual paths inside your cells. Solve your maze. Proofread your maze. Scan or copy your maze to get ink copies that other people can attempt to solve.  , Finished.
Fitted bedsheets are the type which have elastic at both ends, to hold the sheet onto the bed. While you can still make this dress with a normal sheet it will require more effort as you will have to sew the elastic in yourself. You will need either a double (135cm/53 inches wide) or king (150cm/59 inches wide) sized fitted bed sheet, depending on your size and the size of skirt that you want. Check that you can't see through the material from any side, no matter how hard you look. If there is any simple, or even non-simple, way to see through it, don't use it - it will show your underwear, guaranteed. This trumps everything else, from sales to pushy store employees to softness and comfort. This may be a problem with cheap or pale coloured sheets. If you are recycling an old sheet, make sure it doesn't have any worn patches or marks.  These will be near where the elasticized parts end, you can identify them by the seams there. Find the place where the seam starts (not at the edge of the sheet)  , The line to cut along is usually clear from the creases from the way the sheet is folded in the packet.  When tackling the elasticated part, be careful that you don't lose the elastic inside the rest of the sheet. Then put the side pieces to one side so you can work on the main part of the sheet.  Just above the knee is usually a good length for this type of skirt, if you aren't sure.   It's often a good idea to get a friend to help with this step, as measuring yourself can be difficult. If you do do this yourself, make sure you don't bend down to check the measurement, you'll end up making it shorter than you intended. , When you're happy with this, sew the ends of the elastic together.  This should leave you with a tube of fabric with one elasticized end.  The "rough" side of your fabric should be on the inside. Make sure you keep the seam lined up at the top.  Stretch out the elastic to make this job easier.  There should be plenty of extra stretch in the elastic when taking it on and off, as you will lose some of the elasticity when you attach the top part of the dress. ,,, Do not pin to the skirt. ,,	Find or buy a fitted bed sheet. Find the corners of your sheet. Cut along the length of your sheet from corner to corner on both non-elasticized sides. Unpick the corner seams. Measure from just under your bust to where you want the skirt to fall. Cut the sheet to double the length you just measured, measuring from one of the elasticized ends.  , Pin the elastic together to form a circle, and check that you are able to stretch the elastic enough to wear it, and that it isn't too loose or too tight around your waist. Sew the length of the sheet together. Fold the material back on itself so you have a double thickness tube of fabric. Sew the tops of the fabric together. Turn the skirt the right way around and try it on, make sure that it is the right length and that it fits you. Take one of the side pieces of the sheet and, with the hem at the top, wrap it around you, underneath your arms, crossing the hems over at the front.  , Cut off the excess length of the material.  , Tuck the top into the skirt and pin the top part to the skirt where the hems cross over and at each side.  , Mark the line where the top of the dress will meet the skirt, while wearing the dress, with pins in the top part of the dress. Take off the dress and stretch out the skirt enough to sew the top part of the dress to it, following the line you marked with the pins.  , Sew the back of the dress to the skirt, once again stretching out the skirt just enough to do this.  , Cut off any excess material from the top.
, When the brakes are not applied, they should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel rim, and when the lever is squeezed, they should make full contact at about half the distance the lever will travel.  You may use a lubricant in an aerosol can with a tube to spray oil into the cable housing at the ferrell where the cable enters the housing underneath the brake levers. A light machine oil with a small nozzle similar to "3 in 1" Oil, or a special brake cable oil purchased at a bike shop is recommended. WD-40, and similar products may "wash" the factory lubricant off the cable, and when they evaporate, there will be very little lubricant residue on the cable.  This is done by removing the clamp at either the caliper or brake lever, and pulling it out the opposite end. If you remove the cable, use an aerosol solvent (or even WD-40) to flush any dirt or debris from the cable tube while the cable is out. Apply a light coat of lithium grease or machine oil to the cable, and reinstall it if it is not damaged.  When the brake pads are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel with the lever released, tighten the clamp.  Buy the same diameter cable, factory fitted, in the same length as the original equipment. Making up the ferrells, cutting the cables to the correct length, and threading cables cut with pliers through the clamps is a difficult chore.	Lubricate the caliper pivot.  , Check the adjustment of your brake cables. Lubricate the cables. Remove the cable from its casing, only if it is very stiff, or difficult to operate. Thread the loose end of the cable through the clamp at the end you removed previously, and check the "free travel" (the distance the brake lever can be squeezed before the brake contacts the wheel). Replace either the cable, or the complete cable assembly if the steps above did not solve the problem of the cable not moving when the brakes are applied.
The secret to finding a dance partner isn't a secret at all -- it's simply conversation. Look her in the eye, say hello, and introduce yourself. That may seem terrifying, but it is far easier, and more effective, then trying bad pick-up lines or hoping she comes up to you. If she smiles back or seems interested in talking, get to know her a bit and invite her onto the dance floor.While it seems cliche, confidence really is the best way to meet women. Simply put yourself next to her and start talking -- you're already ahead of 90% of the other men. If you're having trouble making conversation, just go out onto the dance floor and start dancing, usually with friends. Again, this just shows the kind of confidence that will make it easier to find women. You will get rejected sometimes -- but it is not personal. A girl may have a boyfriend, want to be with her friends, or just not feel great. Rejection is inevitable, so move on and find someone else.; , If you're worried about striking up a conversation or it's too loud to talk, just go to the dance floor and start enjoying yourself. As you dance, look around for women who are dancing by themselves or in a small group. You don't want to rush at them, but any women looking for a partner will likely have her eyes up as well.   If you're uncomfortable dancing, just sway back and forth with the rhythm of the drums. Lift each arm individually with the beat and keep your joints loose and relaxed. You'll blend right in. If a woman is with a group of friends, dodges eye contact, or seems busy with another man, just move on. Plenty of people go to clubs to find someone to dance with, so don't waste everyone's time chasing a girl who doesn't want the attention.  The near-universal sign of attraction is eye-contact and a smile.Whether you meet on the dance floor or at the bar, good eye contact and a natural smile is the key to sparking a connection. In fact, smiling is proven to be the most effective form of flirting, so look happy.If she reciprocates, you can:   Nod your head towards the dance floor. Ask "care for a dance?" Offer her your hand to her and playfully pull her towards the floor. Move in closer while you dance., This isn't just a bad way to spend an evening, it's not going to work. If you seem like you're hunting for a woman to dance with, trying everything to get one to like you, you're going to come off as desperate. Again, though it seems easier said than done, be confident, cool, and collected. You are there to have a good time, but you should remember that you don't need a woman to enjoy yourself. Talk to your friends, start a conversation at the bar, and go dance when you want to dance. You'll be surprised how attractive this personal confidence can be.   Never try and juggle multiple "options" throughout the night. Chances are good it will backfire, and you'll justifiably look like a jerk., Don't try to impress anyone with spastic, difficult moves you can't pull off. Simply feel the groove and get moving. Above all, try to do all the following moves fluidly, not as fast as you can or with large, expressive accents. If you want to practice, make sure that you have some music on. A mirror can help too, helping you see exactly what you look like to try and improve.   Dancing is all about feel, not showing off. As long as you stay on the beat (follow the drums if you get lost) you'll be fine. Repetition while dancing is fine! Don't feel like you need to change things up every 30 seconds., This simple dance staple can be used for at any song, anywhere. To do it, start with both feet roughly shoulder-width apart. Count out the beats on the drum: 1,2,3,4 - 1,2,3,4, - etc. Step your right foot out to the right on the first beat. Then follow with your left foot, tapping your left toe down by the right foot on the second beat. One the third beat, step your left foot to the left. Then follow with your right foot, tapping the toe down on the last beat. You'll be right back where you started, so keep repeating it. Variations include:   Keep your arms up, snapping, clapping, or pumping them to the beat as well. Just don't leave them glued to your side. Rotate and swing your shoulders with the beat to get your upper body involved. On the second and fourth step, try landing with your heel out in front of you instead of your toe, or placing your tow behind your planted foot. As you get better, trying moving forward, backward, or around as you do the two-step., Grinding is perhaps the most common and intimate partner dance that happens in the clubs. Luckily, it is also incredibly easy to do. Place your hands on her hip, and stagger your feet with hers so that you're not constantly bumping knees. From there, simply swing your hips back and forth together on the beat. She will likely take charge, so just lock into her rhythm and move with her, keeping your hips swinging from side to side. You can add some simple variations by:   Removing one hand and raising it in the air, or clasping on of her hands. Bending your knees together and going down low, especially if the song is calming down before a drop. Spinning her around and trying face to face, especially if there is good chemistry between you both.  It is the easiest dance move possible, but also perfectly acceptable in the club. Just bend your knees slightly to the beat, rocking your shoulders back and forth as you do. Keep your hands up, snapping or clapping as you do, so that your whole body appears loose and relaxed. If you've got nothing else, this will always keep you moving.   Remember to move to the drum beat. Rhythm is easy, just follow the "boom-clap, boom-clap" found in the drum section of 99% of club songs., Dancing well is not as complicated as it looks. Of course, complex moves take years of training to get right, but in the club all you need are two or three staples that you can string together. Once you can do the two-step and bounce confidently to the beat, try adding the following slight movements together, doing them for 4-8 beats and then switching it up.Bob or turn your head to the beat. Rotate one of your knees back and forth. Turn and twist your shoulders back and forth, bending down with the beat. Pivot or twist on one toe. Extend your arms out in front of you, crossing and uncrossing them.  It doesn't matter how good or bad you are-- if you stay in time, you'll be fine. Luckily, club music is easy to dance to, since the drums will count out your steps for you. Move your feet, shoulders and arms in time with the "boom - chick'" of the drum beat. Every time you hear the "snap" of a snare drum, touch a foot down. This should be all the rhythm you need.   Step one foot to the side, then bring your other foot to meet it. Then move back to the other side. This quick "two-step" looks natural no matter what is playing. Do not try and change or adapt your tempo to fit her if you feel off; this just makes it harder for both of you to find time together. Just listen to the music and sync your body up with that -- she will do the same without your help., In older forms of dance, a male typically led the female across the floor in complex patterns. Club dancing requires no such bravado, especially if you're not a natural dancer. So, instead of trying to be something you're not, just let go and enjoy yourself. Follow her led for a bit. Take her hand and spin her. Bend your knees and go down low together when the beat slows down. Move slightly away and bust a move, even if it's corny. Instead of trying to come up with the perfect dance "plan," just have fun -- chances are it will rub off on her.If you are a good dancer, and you feel confident, go ahead and take the lead. Don't pinch or otherwise make childish grabs at her. You'll destroy whatever chemistry there was between the two of you. Play it safe and follow her lead until you're perfectly clear on what she wants., Some ladies will want to increase the intensity while others want to take it slow. Don't rush into it, and definitely do not start grabbing or holding onto her. Depending on the situation, there are comfortable, non-confrontational places to put your hands, and let her dictate what she wants from there. Realize, however, that these are just suggestions -- the two of you should feel comfortable setting and respecting boundaries together. If she likes something, it's fine -- if she rejects it, you need to stop.   If you're grinding, dancing back-to-front and up close, you can start with one hand high on her waist, at about the top of her hipbone. If you're leading her to the dance floor, you can hold her hand or lightly place yours on in the middle of her back. If you're dancing face to face, you likely won't start with a lot of physical contact. But grabbing her hand and taking her for a quick, playful spin is a great way to bridge the gap.  Once you're dancing with a woman you should be having fun with her, not off looking for another conquest. The reasons are numerous, but the most important one is that it is rude. If you're not enjoying the woman you're dancing with then stop dancing with her and actually find someone else -- otherwise you should be in the moment with her., As the songs change, do the same thing with your moves. Get down low. Put your arms around different parts of her body (within reason, unless she suggests otherwise). Incorporate hand gestures on occasion. Above all -- do it with a smile on your face. You don't need to make a fool of yourself, you just need to have fun. So open up a little bit, make her laugh, and keep dancing. If you're looking to broaden your dancing move set, check out:   Learn to Dance Dance Some Basic Moves Dance at the Club.  Most women do not go to the club to find the single best dancer there and take them home, even though most men seem to think they have to be the greatest moon walker since Michael Jackson. In reality, the best partners are fun, confident, and able to stay on a beat. The lights are low, drinks have been poured, and the music is bumping. So stop worrying about getting everything perfect and have a good time -- you'll get a lot more dances as a result.	Strike up a conversation with a woman at the bar or edge of the dance floor. Head down to the dance floor to see if anyone wants a partner. Make eye contact and smile to see if she wants to dance. Don't spend your whole night searching for women. Keep your movements simple and low-key. Learn the two-step to get through any song at any club. Bump and grind if a woman moves in closely, so that your hips are touching or close by. Bounce to the beat if you're lost or unsure what to do. Mix and match simple movements together to appear like an amazing dancer. Pay attention to the drum beat to dance with rhythm. Let the "leader" of the dance come out organically. Let her initiate any increase in touching. Focus your attention on her, not other women. Mix up your moves as you get more comfortable. Don't look at dancing as a competition or "test" you need to win.
Since publishers look for new material based on genre, it's better for you to focus your songwriting in a single genre; you can also cross over to other genres later.,, Search the databases of ascap.com, bmi.com, sesac.com, in the U.S.A. or the performing rights organization in your country. Look for song titles and writers in your genre, find out who publishes them, and research how you can submit your songs. Another way to find publishers is to pick up Billboard Magazine, look up songs on the Hot 100, R&B or Country charts in your genre, and see the accompanying list of publishers.Call the publisher to confirm who you should send your music to, and in what format.  This is so important that if you don't live in or near a city where people can make a living writing songs (a 'music centre') then you should seriously consider moving.Attend industry functions Hang out wherever the 'movers and shakers' in your industry and genre hang out Go to songwriter nights Join relevant associations  In Canada: SOCAN (The Society of composers, authors and music publishers in Canada) In the US: BMI or ASCAP   Be assertive yet polite when meeting key people in the industry; remember that they are probably bombarded by pushy starving artists every day.Co-write songs with both published and unpublished artists (you never know when someone you've worked with will introduce you to their publisher, now or later)  , Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether or not to sign with a particular publisher:How quickly can the publisher pay? Does the publisher have an international network to collect money abroad via sub-publishing agreements or via membership of overseas collection societies? How is publishing income split with songwriting partners or other members of the band? Straighten this out from the start so you don't battle it out later in court. If the person who signed you leaves the company, are there others who are as enthusiastic about your music as they were who can pick up where they left off? Does the publisher specialize in your genre? Can the publisher pay an advance? Do you prefer a large or small publisher?	Define your genre and stick to it. Create a demo.  , Submit your music to publishers directly. Network within the music industry. When you're offered a publishing contract, get a lawyer.
Speed up your tempo only after you are comfortable playing rudiments at a slower pace.; , Because keeping solid time is so integral to playing drums, a metronome is a necessary component to at least a portion of any practice session.  Listening to music you are unfamiliar with can also help ease you into a new style.  Most professional drummers who get hired for studio work have a "toolbox" of drumming styles that they can draw from, which might include jazz, rock, funk, bossa nova, rockabilly, salsa, samba, or blues beats.  Instead of jumping ahead to learn new drumbeats every week, work through the styles you already know and practice them to perfection. Practice every song or beat until you can play it comfortably and confidently.  The lack of bounce you feel when you strike a pillow with a drumstick forces your wrists to work harder, which will benefit you when you play on an actual drum.	Learn drum rudiments and practice running through all of them smoothly. Play along to a metronome, or "click track.", Play along to recordings of music you enjoy or are curious to learn about. Learn to play variety of styles. Hone your style. Practice drumming on a pillow.
Ombre painting simply means painting in a gradient, employing different shades of the same color to create the effect of fading. Before painting your dresser, decide if you want to create an ombre effect from top to bottom or from left to right.If your dresser has drawers stacked vertically, you can paint each drawer face a different color. This will make top-to-bottom ombre much easier.; , When painting, decide whether you’d like to start with a lighter color and gradually move to a darker shade, or start with dark and move to light. You can use paint swatches to play around with direction before beginning.If you choose a vertical gradient and only paint your drawer faces instead of the entire dresser, you can mix and match light to dark and dark to light as the mood strikes you by switching the drawers around.  You can either paint the entire dresser ombre, or you can choose a solid background color and paint the dresser drawers different shades. Although the choice is yours, the gradient will be cleaner if you paint different shades on drawers alone and having a single background color, such as white or gray.Although using a single background color is the most popular way to paint a dresser, you can mix paint colors to create a gradual color shift in the background, then have a more dramatic ombre effect using the drawers.  Once you have decided on your preferred color and direction, purchase different shades of a single color of paint to correspond to your dresser. If you have five drawers, purchase five colors, etc.You could also create a few different shades by purchasing your preferred color and white and mixing the two in different ratios.  Painting with both a brush and spray can is a messy affair, so lay drop cloths down wherever you decide to paint. Even if you are painting in your backyard, you’ll want to have a piece of fabric to catch any stray paint droplets.   If you opt for spray paint, you may also want to place drop cloths upright behind the dresser, or stand cardboard behind the surface., Most dresser drawers have at least one drawer pull, so be sure you remove all of these before you paint. Although you could paint around the pulls, you run the risk of spilling paint on them and ruining them. Removing the pulls will also help you get an even coat over the entire surface of the drawer or cabinet.This would be an excellent time to paint your drawer pulls if you’d like to alter them to better match your ombre colors.  Even if your dresser has not been stained or painted previously, sand the area you are planning to paint. Paint cannot adhere to slick, smooth surfaces, so sanding will help toughen the surface a bit to help paint stick.If the surface of the dresser has not been painted or stained, this need not be a long process. Instead of using an electric sander, run a single piece of sandpaper over the dresser’s surface by hand once or twice.  Sanding leaves behind a lot of residue, so be sure to thoroughly wipe the entire dresser down, including inside the drawers. Sawdust is infamous for getting caught in unwanted spaces and could easily make the paint clump as you go, resulting in an uneven finish.A damp cloth is enough to wipe everything down.  Using long, consistent strokes, apply the first coat of paint. Allow the paint to dry before moving on to a second or third coat of paint. The more layers you paint, the darker your shade will be, so keep this in mind before you paint multiple coats.If you are painting the base white, you can begin there and move on to mixing colors next.  To preserve the amount of brushes you need to use, finish with a single paint color before moving on to the next. Although this will require more time to complete, you will save money on brushes and will avoid having to go back over any areas after you’ve finished.This technique is particularly wise if you choose to mix white and one other color, as you could easily mix up your color shades. Make sure you wash and dry your brushes thoroughly between colors to prevent running and splotchy color.  If your brush dripped and you weren’t able to wipe the drip away quickly enough, or you didn’t see a drip until you’d finished, now is the time to sand down those areas and any still-rough areas or edges of the wood.   Make sure the paint has dried completely before you sand.Using a damp cloth, wipe the sanded area down again, touching up any areas rendered uneven by the sandpaper.  Once you have completely finished painting, seal your paint job with a brush-applied sealant. There are some sealants specifically designed for furniture, if you’d like, but if your dresser will not be coming into contact with young children or animals, a simple coat of polyurethane will do.Sealing will help prevent fading, scratching, and scuffing, and will help your colors last longer.  Spray paint is much thinner than paint you’d find inside of a tin, so holding the spray can closer could result in a blotchy, unattractive coat of paint. It could also make your paint drip.   As you paint, move your hand smoothly from side to side., Although spray paint typically dries faster than canned paint, you should still wait between coats to make sure each coat has completely dried. This will keep your color consistent and even, and will prevent the spotting effect frequently seen when using spray paint.Provided you are in a clean area, you can enlist the help of a fan to speed the drying process.  As with canned paint, you must sand and wipe down any areas of the dresser with more heavily concentrated paint and wipe away the residue left behind. Thick drips are far less common with spray paint, but higher concentrations of paint (usually in a circular pattern) are common.After you sand, you might need to go back over the area.  Unlike canned paint, you can move from one color to the next while you wait for colors to dry, as you will not need to share containers or brushes. Because spray paint dries faster than standard paint, you may be able to move through the painting process more quickly.   If you move back and forth between spray paint colors, make sure you paint on a different part of the drop cloth to avoid accidentally spraying the wrong color on your drawers.  To keep the consistency of your paint, use a spray sealant rather than a tin of sealant. Many spray sealants are quite thick in texture, so a single coat of the sealant should do.	Decide upon a horizontal or vertical ombre effect. Choose the direction and severity of your gradient. Choose a background color. Purchase your paint shades. Lay down a drop cloth. Remove all hardware. Sand the painting area. Wipe down after sanding to remove dust. Apply the first coat of the first color. Finish one color entirely before moving on to the next. Sand any rough edges or paint splatters. Seal the painted areas. Spray your first color, keeping the can at least six inches from the surface. Allow each coat to dry before applying another coat. Sand and wipe down any bumps. Continue moving through your paint colors. Finish with a spray seal, such as polyurethane.
A crew sock or a knee sock would work great for this! The sock can be any color you like. It can be fuzzy or plain. It can even have stripes or polka dots! Jut make sure there aren't any holes.; , Once you the sock on, make a C-shape with your hand. Put your fingers into the toe part. Try to get your thumb into the heel part. If you can't reach it, tuck the sock into the groove between your thumb and fingers.         Open and close your hand. Your sock should already start looking like a puppet.  If you want your puppet to have a nose, make a dot for that as well.  Spread it flat on the table. The marks for the eyes and nose may look out of place, but that's fine. This is why you made them while wearing the sock.  You can do this with a hot glue gun, fabric glue, or tacky glue. For the actual eyes, you can use buttons, pompoms, or googly eyes. You can also draw the eyes on with a marker.          If your puppet is a girl, draw some eyelashes with a marker!  , You can also cut a triangle or circle out of felt and use that instead. A button would also make a cute nose. If you don't have any of these, you can draw a nose on instead!         , Your puppet is done at this point. You can still glue items onto it to give it more character. For example, you can glue some yarn to the top for hair. For more ideas, click here.	Find a clean sock that's long enough to cover your arm. Slip the sock over your hand. Use a marker to make two dots above the seam for the eyes. Take the sock off. Glue some eyes onto the sock. Glue a small pompom just above the seam for the nose. Add some other decorations.
A variety of different materials can be used to make art and each of these materials will create a different visual effect. For example, sculptors can use stone, marble, wire or wood to create their art. Similarly, painters can use watercolours, oil, chalk, and pencil. When you are looking at art, comment on the materials or medium used to create the image. If you can't identify them, look at the label., In order to sound knowledgeable while discussing art, learn to identify the style of art. For example, some common and recognizable styles include abstract, realist, expressionist, surrealist, or impressionist. A piece of art that uses realism can be easily identified because the artist attempts to create an image that looks real, almost like a photograph.Alternatively, an abstract piece of art does not attempt to mimic reality and instead, can include random splatters of paint or lines to create a thought provoking image. Familiarize yourself with the different styles by searching online for images of the different styles of art. For example, search for "impressionist images." Visit museums, which often group art by style. You may find yourself in a room of surrealist paintings, for instance.  The style of art can also be described by looking at the content of the image. For example, learn the differences between portraits (image of a person), landscapes (image of a place), or still life (image of an object) works of art., It is also a good idea to know some descriptive words that you can use while describing art. You can use them to describe the mood of the painting, as you perceive it:Dynamic Intimate Suggestive Challenging  , You may have heard of renaissance art, modern art, or cubism before. These are a few different time periods and movements within art history. To talk about a work of art, check its time period. Consider how the historic moment impacted the way that art was created.   Consider the movements that were happening at that time. For example, Cubism was a type of modern art that was developed in the early twentieth century. Artists, such as Picasso, departed from the romantic and realistic artwork of the late nineteenth century and began creating more abstract images.Think about any major world events, such as war, that may be reflected in the piece. Consider what was taboo at the time and place the art was made. Works that may not seem shocking now might have been, then, or vice versa.	Talk about the materials used. Identify the style of art. Consider the content. Familiarize yourself with common descriptive terms. Check the time period of the piece.
For best results, choose a pair that is roughly the same shade as the pillowcase used for the tunic. The pants should be fairly tight rather than baggy. Semi-baggy pants will work as long as they fit, but pants that are just wide enough to slip on and off are ideal. If desired, you can slim the pants by having the intended wearer try them on and pinning along the sides to desired tightness. Turn the pants inside out and sew along the pin-line. Finally, cut off the excess material and turn the pants right-side-out again.  Cut two long strips of canvas, felt, or another strong fabric in a shade that matches the pants as closely as possible. The strips should be long enough to extend from the waist to the hem of the pants along the sides. To create the fringe, cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits along one side of the strip. Space the slits approximately a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart.The strips should be about 1.5 inches (3.8-cm) wide. If you’re short on time, you can also use store-bought fringe.  Use fabric glue or a needle and thread to attach the strips of fringe to the sides of both pant legs. If you want to make sure that the pants can be worn multiple times, it’s best to sew on the fringe. Glue or sew along the 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide section of the band that does not have fringe on it, and apply it over the side seam on each pants leg. If you prefer to wear a skirt with your costume, add the fringe all along the hem of a brown or tan skirt instead.	Find an old pair of tan khaki pants. Create fringe for the sides. Attach the fringe to the pants.
Mixing is the process of affecting parts of a single track and the overall master track. You can edit the high, low, and mid frequency range for each track. Once the tracks sound good together, experiment with panning the tracks to the left or right. Panning is a good way to isolate a track and blend it in with other tracks.   Most multitrack recorders come equipped with an equalizer (EQ). Mixing can help accent parts you want to be more present, or even hide parts you're not thrilled about. Equalize each track and balance everyone. Low sounds should be the strongest for a good balance. For inspiration listen to the Beatles with headphones. They only had a four track recorder and you can hear multiple complex parts interacting and balancing each other out.  Once you record your album, you can add certain effects that will improve the sound of the album. Popular post-production effects are compression and reverb. Compression squeezes the track together, lessening the dynamic range between the loud and quiet parts of the song.As compression brings elements of the sound together, reverb redistributes the sound to fill a space. Reverb widens the sound wave by stimulating the sound bouncing off multiple surfaces.  Mastering is a compression technique used in post-production to ensure every song is equal in volume. You also strive to achieve an equal balance in each speaker. Mastering is not an easy process and may require a more experienced engineer.   Some music software programs come equipped with a simple form of mastering. Record labels will typically have their own engineer to master an album they plan on releasing. There are different techniques for mastering, depending on the form you release your album (vinyl, CD, cassette, or stream).  Burn the CD through the recorder or computer and give it a listen. If it does not sound good in a stereo system or headphones, decide if you want to record certain songs again.   Pass a few copies of the demo out to trusted friends and fellow musicians. Ask them for constructive feedback on the album to determine if the songs are working., Create album art and make the album look good. You can create an image using a design software like Photoshop or Illustrator. Another option you could do is to use a photo of something.   Look at your favorite album covers to decide if you want to pay an artist to do something special like Santana's album Abraxas. Then there are famous album covers that are nothing but a picture like The Beatles' Abbey Road.	Mix the song. Add production effects. Master the album. Make a demo of the album. Design a cover.
If you find black patches on the leaves of your potatoes, suspect blight. This should be sprayed with copper at the first sign.; , If they're turning green, they're exposed to sunlight. Once they're green, they're toxic and no longer edible. Cover up with more soil to prevent this from occurring to remaining potatoes. And check that Fido isn't causing a problem; you might need to keep your dog away from the veggie patch.  Soil nematodes can be a problem for potatoes. If you find them in your potato crop, shift the crop around to another part of the garden. Another alternative is to plant the potatoes in fresh potting mix in the bag and to plant the entire bag in the ground.  Not only will they turn green as mentioned in an earlier step, but the risk of the tuber moth increase when potatoes are exposed at the surface.	Check the leaves. Check the tubers. Prevent pests from entering the potatoes. Cover up tubers if they're exposed. Remove aphids by squashing them or by spraying with soapy water.
There are dozens of wonderful characters to choose, from Cinderella (the most famous of them all) to Jasmine to Belle. Figure out which one you relate to most or simply like the best, and plan to dress up like her.   If you feel like a more classic princess approach, go with Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty's Aurora. They share that timeless princess style that includes elegant ball gowns and perfectly coiffed hair. Princess Tiana is a Disney character with a hardworking attitude, ambition and a sassy southern personality. She wears a pale green and yellow nature-inspired gown. Belle has a bookish personality and a gorgeous yellow gown. Snow White's blue, red and yellow dress can be found in any costume shop.; , Merida is the fiery red head from the movie Brave. While she doesn’t take any flack from her family, she’s still sweet and lovable. Consider this princess if you're a bit of a rebel.   Merida wears a floor length, long-sleeved blue dress with white lace embellishments around the collar and elbows, as well as a thin brown belt and matching boots.

Generally, stay low and look for a space fresh air is entering. Often, it enters at the eaves and escapes, hotter, at vents higher up. Watch where you'd escape to. Don't escape to a long drop to the ground or an interior floor; instead, attract attention and be rescued.; , Pick up and set aside a loose panel, or swing a door or staircase down.   Until you've tried this, you're just in an attic, not really stuck in an attic. Some attics may have doors into other rooms, or onto a roof. ,, Use something hard to do the tapping, preferably. Do this every so often. , Shift insulation out of the way if possible and stomp or otherwise strike it to break it. Hold onto something so you don't fall through before checking what is underneath. This will open a hole to the room underneath. See what is down there before dropping through.   If the attic has a wall leading to an interior top-level room or an entrance to the roof, try to break that as well.    It may be possible to pop out a nailed-on wooden panel. The ones on the ends of a typical roof are probably easier to hit squarely and less securely attached. Do not strike a surface with nails poking through it. Take care not to throw yourself out after the panel.  If you have a saw, you could even cut a hole (careful, you don't want to be trapped in an attic injured).	An attic can be dangerously hot on a summer day, So, take care to stay out of the heat as much as possible while you work on getting out of the attic. Look around for the attic entrance, typically a small panel or staircase. Look for a light switch to turn on so you can see what you're doing, and so (particularly at night) others may notice your presence by light escaping from the attic.  , If you have a cell phone or other communication device, call for help.  , Tap several times on the beams and the roof to attract attention. If you are feeling weak or sick you should do something quickly to avoid collapsing and cooking.  , Look for a spot in the ceiling made of soft material only, such as sheet rock (generally the whole ceiling in a house is made of it) or wood strips and plaster. Alternatively, pop out a vent or grill to admit fresh air and attract attention, or escape through it if you must. Use a tool to escape if you have it and help is not coming.
Remove the guitar strings and then unscrew the neck of the guitar from the body. Once the body is standing alone, unscrew the screws and knobs on the front of the guitar. Remove the screws on the pickups and bridge of the guitar.If there is a faceplate over your volume knobs, you'll have to remove the plastic portions of the knobs before you can lift the faceplate off.; , Once all of the screws are out on the face of the guitar, you can lift up your bridge and pickups, which are connected by wires. Snip these and solder them later when you put your guitar back together. If you feel unsure about taking your guitar apart, take it to a guitar store so that they can safely do it for you. Make sure all the electrical wiring is removed from the guitar before you start painting it.  Set your heat gun or hairdryer to the lowest setting and move it back and forth, across the body of your guitar. The heat from your hairdryer or heat gun will soften the finish on your guitar and make it easier to lift up the paint. Continue heating the paint for five minutes and then use a sharp tool to poke at the paint. If the paint feels soft, you can go onto the next step.Do not hold the heat gun in one spot for too long or you may burn the wood that's under the paint.  Start by scoring a small location on the softened paint. Use your putty knife to lift off the old finish and don't worry if it cracks off. Continue to scrape the paint and remove the old finish without damaging the wood under it. If the paint isn't coming off, use the heat gun again to soften it. Once you're done removing the finish, you should see the wood grain under it., Use a 100 grit sandpaper at first and sand over the surface of the guitar's body in the direction of the grain. Sand down irregularities so that the body of the guitar is as smooth as possible. Follow the contours of the guitar and sand the sides and edges of the guitar as well. Once you've sanded it with the 100 grit sandpaper, you can move to a 200 grit sandpaper to sand out smaller irregularities.Use a sanding block if the sandpaper is hurting your hands.  As you sand down your guitar, you're likely to find bumps or divots in the body. Fill divots that you can't sand down with an automotive filler. Once the divots are filled, let it dry for at least 20 minutes so that the automotive filler can cure.Bondo is a popular type of automotive filler., Once you've filled in all divots and the guitar is relatively smooth, you'll have to do one last sanding with the 100 grit sandpaper. Continue to sand until the automotive filler lies flush with the body of the guitar., Don't saturate the wood grain on your guitar to prevent moisture from getting absorbed into to the guitar. Take a microfiber cloth or a clean rag and wipe over the surface, making sure to remove any sawdust or debris that might be on the guitar.   Debris or dust left on the guitar will get sealed into the paint job.  Lay down drop cloths under the guitar so that the paint doesn't stain the surface that you're painting on. Alternatively, you can hang the guitar from the ceiling and spray it as it's suspended in the air., You can purchase wood sealer online or at a hardware store. Purchase a water based wood sealer that has a high gloss. If you are painting your guitar a lighter color, use a white sealer and if you're painting it a dark color, apply a gray sealer., Saturate a dry rag in the sealer. Once the rag is saturated, drag it along the grain on the surface of your guitar. Make long movements and do not scrub in a single area with the sealer. Once the back of the guitar is sealed, turn the guitar over and finish sealing the front and sides.Once your rag looks dirty, dispose of it and use another, clean rag.  Let the sealer dry for an hour or two and come back and apply another even coat of sealer. The sealer will help the colored coats of paint adhere to the body of the guitar much easier. Continue adding more coats of sealer until you've covered the guitar three to five times in total.Remember to let the sealer dry in between each new application.  Feel over the sealer to make sure that it's no longer wet or sticky. Make sure that the guitar dries in a well-ventilated area so no one gets sick from the sealer's fumes., Using a 200 grit sandpaper, carefully sand over the shiny parts of the sealer. Make sure not to sand too hard or you may expose the wood grain underneath. If you do do this, simply reapply more coats of sealer to the guitar and allow it to dry before moving on. When you're done, the guitar should have a dull white or gray color., Typical guitar paint includes polyester, polyurethane, and nitrocellulose. Polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder, more plastic-feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner. If you're unsure of what kind of paint to get, look for spray paint that's made specifically for guitars., Position the nozzle on the spray can 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 cm) away from the body of the guitar. Remember to cover the edges of the guitar. Press down on the button on the spray can and go in long, sweeping back and forth motions across the body of the guitar., Touch the surface of the guitar to make sure that none of the paint transfers to your hand. The paint may still be sticky and you'll still be able to see the sealer under the basecoat that you just sprayed., Once the guitar is dry, flip it over and spray down the other side of the guitar. You should now have one solid basecoat of paint over the front and back of your guitar., Allow each coat of paint to dry for five minutes before applying the next coat. Continue flipping the guitar over so that the entire guitar gets even coverage. Continue to cover your guitar in coats of paint until the paint gets darker and richer. This could take anywhere from three to seven coats of paint., Once you're done laying down the base color for your guitar, you'll have to let the paint dry for another one or two days in a well-ventilated area. Once it's completely dry, you can move onto the next step. , Once the color coat is dry, run your fingers over the surface, sides, and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth. If the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy, you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper. Saturate the sandpaper in water overnight, then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it's still wet.Wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar.  Clear lacquer paint will give your guitar a shiny finish over the paint. You can purchase clear lacquer paint at a home improvement store or online. Spray the clear lacquer the same way you sprayed the base coat, putting four separate coats of lacquer on the guitar and letting the paint dry in between sprays., Don't touch your guitar for three weeks as the paint dries. During this time the paint will cure and should be a rich solid color, but will be missing the polish that guitars typically have., Saturate a rag or cloth with car polish and work it on the surface of the guitar using small, circular motions. This should refine the shine in the guitar and make it more reflective. One you're done polishing the guitar, it should be shiny and reflective.	Remove your guitar strings and the screws in the body of the guitar. Remove the electrical components connecting the bridge and pickups. Heat the old paint with a hairdryer or heat gun. Lift off the old paint with a putty knife. Sand the body of the guitar. Fill any holes with an automotive filler. Sand the automotive filler so it lies flush with the guitar's surface. Dust the guitar with a dry rag. Lay the guitar down on a flat surface. Choose a wood sealer. Apply wood sealer to the guitar. Allow the guitar to dry and apply three to five coats of sealer. Let the sealer dry for three days. Sand off the shiny portions of the sealer. Choose a paint for your guitar. Spray your base coat onto the guitar. Let the paint dry for ten minutes. Flip the guitar over and spray the other side. Apply additional coats of base paint to the guitar. Let the paint dry. Sand the paint using 400-grit wet sandpaper. Spray clear lacquer onto the guitar. Let the guitar dry for three weeks. Polish the guitar with car polish.
Knead some clay in your hands until it turns soft. Place it onto a smooth surface, then roll it out into a thin sheet using an acrylic tube. How thick or thin you roll the clay out is up to you.  If you can't find an acrylic tube, you can use another smooth, cylindrical object, such as a rolling pin or fat pen. You can also use a pasta machine.; , You can leave the clay blank to make plain buttons. You can also make fancy buttons by adding texture. Press a stamp or texture mat on top of the clay to make an imprint, then peel it off.Background stamps with damask, scrolled, or floral designs work great for buttons.You can also use lace, doilies, or even draw your own design using a toothpick., This will give your buttons rounded, beveled edges. It will give them a more professional-looking finish. If you do not want rounded or beveled edges, you can skip this step.Be careful not to smooth your stamped designs.  You can do this using small cookie cutters or shaped clay butters. Press the tool into the clay, right over the plastic wrap, then pull it out. You can cut as many buttons as you'd like., Discard the plastic wrap. Crumple up the excess clay, and add it back to the brick or to your scrap clay bin., Smaller buttons only need two holes, but larger ones might need four. Make sure that all of the holes are centered and spaced evenly apart. You can poke them using skewers, toothpicks, knitting needles, or even plastic coffee stir sticks.  Wiggle toothpicks and skewers around a little to widen the holes.  Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the clay's wrapper. Once the oven reaches the right temperature, place the buttons onto a foil-lined baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the oven, then let the clay bake for the time specified on the label.  It does not matter how far apart or how close together the buttons are on the baking sheet. Each brand of clay is a little different, so the baking times and temperatures will vary.  Allow the buttons to cool first. Add some designs to the buttons using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush. Let the paint dry, then apply some glaze using a paintbrush. Let the glaze dry completely before you use the buttons.  You can also apply glaze to unpainted buttons as well. If you added a stamped design, consider rubbing the paint off with a paper towel. This will reveal the clay's original color along the raised areas.Thick glaze may cover up the button holes. If this happens, run a toothpick or a skewer through the holes to clear them up.	Roll out a thin sheet of clay. Add some texture, if desired. Cover the clay with a sheet of plastic wrap. Cut the buttons out. Peel the plastic wrap and excess clay away. Poke two to four holes into each button. Bake the buttons in a preheated oven. Paint or glaze the buttons, if desired.
Take a strip of painter's tape and wrap it around your fingers with the sticky side facing outward. Dab the tape over the roller until it's completely free of lint.Removing lint from the roller with ensure that you have an even paint job.  Before you load your roller, you'll want to make sure that the paint doesn't have any lumps and is smooth as possible. To do this, make sure that you thoroughly stir the paint with a painter's mixing stick or paddle before transferring it to your paint tray or bucket., Once you've loaded your paint roller, you should wait for a minute to allow the paint to soak into the roller. This will make your paint job more even and smooth., For water based paint like latex, priming your roller may make it easier to load it. Saturate your roller under cold water from the faucet. Quickly roll the roller six or seven times in the air, then dry the rest of it off with paper towels.While priming your paint roller isn't necessary, it may make applying and loading your paint roller easier.	Remove lint from the roller with painter's tape. Mix the paint thoroughly. Let the roller sit for a minute after loading it. Prime the roller with water for water-based paints.
In order to get liquid soap to transform and form bubbles, you need the right mix of oils and a chemical called potassium hydroxide, also known as lye. This recipe yields six quarts of soap.You can get these ingredients at health stores, craft stores or online:   11 oz. potassium hydroxide flakes 33 oz. distilled water 24 oz. coconut oil 10 oz. olive oil 10 oz. castor oil 3 oz. jojoba oil  , When you work with lye, you need to wear safety gear and set up your work area properly. Plan to work in a well-ventilated room with good lighting so you can see what you're doing. You'll need the following supplies:   A crock pot Plastic or glass measuring bowls Kitchen scale Stick blender Gloves and protective goggles  , Weigh the oils and place them in the crock pot on low heat. Make sure you add the exact amount specified for each oil; adding more or less will throw off the recipe.  Put on your protective gear and make sure the window is open. Weigh the distilled water in a large bowl. Weigh the lye in a separate bowl, then add it to the water. Stir it constantly as you pour it in.Make sure you add the lye to the water, and not the other way around! Adding water to lye causes a dangerous reaction.  Pour the solution into the crockpot slowly, making sure none splashes back onto your skin. Use the stick blender to blend the lye with the oils to make sure they get thoroughly combined.   As you blend the liquids, the mixture will begin to thicken. Continue stirring until it reaches trace, which happens when the mixture gets thick enough that you can run a spoon through it and see the line in its wake. The mixture will continue to thicken into a paste., Continue cooking the mixture on low for about six hours, checking it every 30 minutes to break it up with a spoon. The paste is finished cooking when you can dissolve one ounce of paste in two ounces of boiling water and it comes out clear, rather than milky. If your test comes out milky, keep cooking.  You should have about a pound of paste after it's finished cooking; weight it just to make sure, then put it back in the crock pot. Add 33 oz. of distilled water to the paste to dilute it. It may take a few hours for the paste to get completely dissolved into the water.  Use your favorite essential oil and a natural food coloring to add a special scent and color to your soap once it has been diluted.  Pour the soap into jars you can seal, since you'll have a lot more than you can use at one time. Pour the soap you want to use into a soap bottle with a pump dispenser.	Gather ingredients. Get the right equipment. Heat the oils. Make the lye solution. Add the lye solution to the oils. Cook the paste. Dilute the paste. Add fragrance and color. Store the soap.
Wrap the yarn around your hook, bringing it around from the back to the front.   Only yarn over once. Yarn over around the tip of the hook, just below the hook opening and above the loop already on your hook.; , Slide the tip of the crochet hook into the stitch in which you want to make your half double crochet.   If you are following a crochet pattern, this stitch should be specified in the instructions. Only the tip of the hook needs to be inserted into the stitch. You do not need to draw any of your yarn loops through.  From the back of the piece, wrap yarn over the tip of the hook and into or just below the opening of the hook.   As before, only yarn over once and do so by wrapping the yarn from back to front.  Pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch. This action should turn the yarn-over into a loop.   At this point, you should have a total of three loops on your hook. Note that the opening of the hook will need to latch onto the yarn-over as you pull it back through to the front. If you have difficulty sliding the hook back through, you may need to keep a little tension on the chain or row by pinching it between the thumb and forefinger of your opposite hand (the hand not holding onto the hook).  Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook one time, working from back to front.   For this yarn-over, make sure that the opening of the hook catches the yarn as you wrap it around.  Drag the yarn-over through all three loops lying below it on your hook.   The yarn-over will need to lie in the opening of your hook and the loops will need to pass over the top of the hook completely. You may need to twist the hook so that the opening faces down as you draw it through the loops on your hook. Otherwise, the opening could accidentally latch onto one or more of the loops. This step completes one half double crochet.  Attach the yarn to your hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation chain that is one chain stitch longer than the number of half double crochet stitches called for in your first row.          For example, if your first row should have 15 half double crochets, your chain must have 16 chain stitches. If you need help making a slipknot on your hook or forming chain stitches, please check the "Tips" section of this article for further instruction.  When preparing to make a half double crochet, count three chain stitches in from your hook. You will skip over the first two chains and work the stitch into the third chain.          Note that the two stitches you skip will count as your "turning chain." A turning chain is a small chain made at the start of a row that raises the row height to the height of the stitch. Do not count the loop on your hook as a chain.  Make a half double crochet stitch into this third chain from your hook, following the instructions previously outlined in the HDC section of this article.          Yarn over the hook once, working from back to front. Insert the tip of the hook into the third stitch from the hook. Yarn over the hook once, working from back to front. Draw this yarn-over back to the stitch and to the front of the chain. There should be three loops on your hook by this point. Yarn over the hook once more, working from back to front. Draw this final yarn-over through all three loops on your hook. This action completes one half double crochet.  For your next half double crochet, you do not need to skip any chains. Work the half double crochet directly into the next stitch of your foundation chain.          Follow the same instructions as before:  Yarn over. Insert the hook into the next stitch. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over to the front of the chain. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over through all three loops on the hook.  To complete a full row of half double crochets, continue making half double crochets until you reach the last stitch of the chain. Do not skip any stitches; instead, work each half double crochet into the chain directly next to the stitch you just finished.          When you finish, there should be one less half double crochet stitch as there were chain stitches. For example, if your foundation chain had 16 stitches in it, you should be able to complete 15 half double crochets. This count includes the "turning chain" (the two skipped stitches) at the beginning of the row. Note that for most crochet pieces, you will need to flip the work over once you reach the end of the row before you begin working on the next row.  Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook to complete this turning chain.   A turning chain exists for the purpose of building the row height up to the height of the stitch before working any actual stitch. This turning chain will count as one half double crochet stitch when you count your stitches at the end of the row. If you need help making chain stitches, please check the "Tips" section of this article for additional instruction.  Skip over the first half double crochet stitch of your previous row. When you work the stitch, you will do so in the second half double crochet from your previous row.   Note that the same concept applies if you are working a row of half double crochets off a row built with a different type of stitch. You will still need to make a turning chain and you will still need to skip over the stitch directly below that turning chain.  Make a standard half double crochet into the second stitch of the previous row. When you insert the hook into your stitch, insert it from front to back and make sure that it goes through the top two loops of the previous row's stitch.   Yarn over from back to front. Insert the hook into the top two loops of the second stitch from the previous row. Yarn over from back to front. Draw this yarn-over back to the front of your row, creating a total of three loops on your hook. Yarn over from back to front. Draw this yarn-over through all three loops on your hook to complete the half double crochet.  To complete a full row of half double crochet, work one half double crochet into the top two loops of each stitch from the previous row. Continue this step until you reach the end of the row.   Again, use the steps outlined for a basic half double crochet:  Yarn over. Insert the hook into the next stitch. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over to the front of the row. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over through all three loops on your hook.   Do not skip any other stitches as you work your way across the row. You will usually need to flip the work over if you plan on making another row after this one. Any additional rows of half double crochet should be completed using the same steps outlined here.	Yarn over. Insert the hook into the stitch. Yarn over. Draw up another loop. Yarn over. Draw through all three loops on the hook. Create a foundation chain. Skip the first two chain stitches. Work a half double crochet. Work another half double crochet. Repeat across the chain. Create a turning chain. Skip a stitch. Work a half double crochet into the next stitch. Repeat across the row.
This can be done in the following ways.   If you haven't driven your car recently then the engine is most likely cold. Start your vehicle as usual and keep the engine running for a few minutes. This should warm up the engine to its normal operating temperature; however you should be careful not to overheat the engine by keeping it started for too long. Usually keeping the engine started for 20 minutes is sufficient. Turn off the car engine and allow the engine to cool if you have recently taken your car for a drive. If the engine is hot, it should be given approximately 1 hour to rest before you do a compression test on it. If you can't start the car engine then just continue with the test anyway. Even though you won't be able to test the engine's performance accurately you will still be able to diagnose that the engine is faulty due to its internal compression if you get a low reading.; ,, This will disable the fuel system so fuel will not be injected into the cylinders.  This will disable the ignition system since the ignition coil pack will be unable to create and distribute the spark from the spark plug.  Handle the spark plugs cautiously since the ceramic insulator of a spark plug can break or malfunction if not handled delicately.  Don't use any additional tools to tighten the compression gauge, you should only use hand force.  The needle on the pressure gauge will rise and once the needle has risen to its maximum reading your helper should stop the engine. This maximum reading is the maximum compression value for the first cylinder that you have just tested.	Bring the engine to its normal running temperature. Switch off the engine completely before beginning the test.  , Remove the fuel pump relay. Disconnect the electrical connection from the ignition coil pack. Disconnect the wires for each spark plug then remove the spark plugs. Put the engine compression gauge into the first cylinder's spark plug hole (this is the hole that is nearest to the drive belt). Ask a helper to crank the engine over continuously. Repeat the engine compression test for the other cylinders until you have tested all of the cylinders on your engine.
You can read the book quietly to yourself, or you can read it aloud to your friends and family. If you have small children, have them work on an art project related to the story when you are done reading.For example:   If you just read The Very Hungry Caterpillar, you can have the kids made a "next" page in the story by gluing pieces of colored paper onto printer paper. If you read The Rainbow Fish, have the kids cut a fish out of purple or blue paper, and then decorate it using glitter glue. If it's dark, don't fret. Light a candle, and get cozy with a blanket and your favorite book.  If it's dark, light a candle or two. Get out a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil, and try one of the following:   Write a letter to a relative. Write a list. The list can be on anything, from shopping lists to foods that are blue. Play word-games like Hangman or Mad Libs. If you don't like to write, draw a picture instead.  If it is fully charged, you should be able to watch at least 3 hours of movies. To save battery power, try to keep the screen as dim as possible, and close any apps that you are not using.  If you know how to play an instrument, you can practice a song that you have been learning, or you can teach yourself a new one.   If you are feeling restless, try singing or dancing along to your favorite songs.  This is a great way to pass time. Not only will you let your creativity soar, but you'll also have something beautiful to show off by the time the powder gets back. Even if you are not a crafter, you might want to consider this. You might find a new hobby for yourself or discover a hidden talent. Listed below are some simple craft ideas to get you started:Do some drawing or coloring. If you own some paints and a canvas, you can also try painting instead. Make some crafty items, such as yarn dolls or duct tape wallets. Try knitting, crochet, or embroidery. A simple scarf or potholder will usually take 2 to 3 hours. Make something out of clay or play-doh.	Read a book. Do some writing.Much like reading, writing can help pass time. Watch movies on a portable DVD player. Listen to or play some music.If you have a portable music player, you can pass the time by listening to your favorite songs. Get crafty.
Visit a local junkyard to check out the oldest cars that are still intact, which might make good candidates. Several Rat-Rodding websites also exist with links to possibilities.Look for one that is not especially rusted, and has its essential shape is still intact. Typically, Rats are made from American cars, often pick-ups, manufactured pre-1960. Popular models for Rat Rods include:   Mid-century Chevrolet pick-up trucks '30s-era Fords, esp. the "Model A" Early Chrysler hemi engines are popular, as well as flathead V-8s; , To strip it down and start fresh, that means you'll need to remove all the seats, fixtures and other accessories from the car. Typically, cars used for Rat Rods are in pretty bad shape to begin with, in terms of the interior, making this step somewhat necessary.  Position a container under the drain cock, or remove one of the fuel lines and collect any gas remaining in the gas tank. This is an essential step in prepping the car for Rodding, as you're going to be doing a lot of welding and any remaining traces of gasoline will be dangerous. Keep a fire extinguisher ready in your shop or garage at all times while you're working.  Measure and mark where you want the vehicle's new axles and wheels to go, then cut the frame up to the desired length using a reciprocating saw. Since a Rat Rod is mostly about the look of the car, you'll mostly be flying by the seat of your pants anyway.   It's usually common to shorten the rear of the vehicle somewhat to accommodate the axle and eliminate any elements, such as roofs or hoods, that you no longer want. Make any cuts to accommodate the drivetrain.  It's also possible to build your own frame, using about 20 feet (6.1 m) of rectangular 2x4 steel tubing in the early stages, cut into two equal sections. Weld them together, patterned like a ladder, as square and as level as possible. Use one cross member toward the front, one in the back, and a crossing pattern in the middle to support the body. Match the width of the frame to the body you intend to use.  Among Rat-Rodders, it's a common goal to try to keep the total price-tag somewhere under $3,000 as a badge of your ability to work with limited materials. If you're up for a challenge, put your skills and your resourcefulness to the test and try to keep the project as cheap as possible by scrounging for a mishmash of parts in the junkyard, or on eBay., You can customize your suspension using the latest in modern suspension technology, making the Rat a hybrid of old and new. Having a Model A that turns on a rail? Yes, please.   Start by measuring the rear width or rear body width and finding axles of the appropriate size. The axle should be somewhat longer than the width, and Leaf Spring rear axles are typically popular options because of their possibility for modification. Anything from the 60s and 70s is also popular, depending on the price. Install coil springs in a side-to-side or parallel pattern by welding the upper mounts on the cross member in the rear and the lower mounts to the axle housing. To keep it cheap, use a straight axle in the front, salvaged or new. The suspension from a Mustang II/ Pinto, AMC Pacer or Corvair are popular and useful choices, though ready-to-weld suspension kits are also available, sometimes for as little as a few hundred bucks, complete with frame and axle brackets, as well as template guides. It's a good investment, if you need new parts.  Old truck bodies are by far the most popular choice, but you can also make use of more modern fiberglass, which is forgiving and easy to work with. Customize your body and make the rod you want, cutting it for the crude-style and swagger you want from a good Rat Rod, then weld it to the frame., try to remember: a Rat Rod is a semi-legal and wonky glorified go-kart, so don't break the bank with the drive train. An old Chevy 350 or a Ford 302 are both super-common and usually-cheap options that you could get and rebuild however you want. Just get the thing running. The great thing about hot-rodding is that if you want to use an engine that really doesn't fit in the body, there's nothing stopping you from doing it but your own creativity and ingenuity. Make it fit. Leave the hood off and do what you want.   You might consider selling the block from the car you got initially, especially if the heads are worn out, then using the extra money you got from the sale to get something from the same era that actually runs. Install any new starters or alternators as you install the engine into the frame. Make sure you have removed as much grease as you can from the engine before installing, then install the transmission and mount the drive shaft and the radiator. Hook up the steering linkage and install the pedals, welding any additional joints that will be necessary to keep the thing together.  You'll be close to running at this point, but you'll still need to install the brakes and tires to try to make the Rod as safe as possible. It might not be street legal, eventually, but you'll have to make the thing stop. Put in a seat, or cut up a couch and use something bootleg and hilarious. Rat Rods are amenable to any weird ideas you've got about cars aesthetically. Have fun with it!  , Rat Rods will often go without typical car accessories. Windows, covered seats, and even doors are purely optional. Keep your tools handy so that you can continue to tweak your rat rod even after you've taken it out for its first ride. Customize it creatively.  Some Rat Rodders like to leave the rusty exterior basically as-is, to show how tough and lasting the original was and remains to be. If you want a slightly more polished look, but want to retain some of the grit, go for a matte base coat with some brownish spray highlights that might resemble rust, but also seal the exterior and protect it some.  Popular at parades and fairs, Rat Rods styled with unique themes will often draw a crowd. Using unusual objects instead of a steering wheel, for example, might be a fun project that'll get people chuckling. Check out other Rat Rods for inspiration and do something unique and fun to make it worth your while.  Unlike hot rods, rat rods are customized cars that are not meant to resemble an antiquated original. Spice up your vehicle with odd adjustments and a colorful body, or dramatically alter the original frame to create an entirely new shape.	Procure an old car. Remove all interior elements from the car. Drain all gasoline from the gas tank. Size the frame however you want it. Improvise. Aim to keep it under $3,000. Install new axles, shocks and suspension system. Mount the body on the frame. Rebuild the existing engine, or install a new engine. Finish the job. Mount a windshield, side-view mirrors, and the rear-view mirror as necessary. Paint the body of the rat rod using matte or spray paint. Give it a theme. Be original.
The stem is essential for allowing the berries to be included in any floral arrangement.; , This allows for maximum surface to uptake water.  Let stand for several hours.  The box will prevent the spray going over other surfaces.  Be sure to get all of the berries and coat all surfaces evenly.  This also gives additional preservation to the berries. Spray two layers, allowing for drying in between.  Once the sprays have dried properly, the berries are now ready to be included as part of your floral arrangement.	Cut the berries with plenty of stem left intact. Cut the stems at an angle. Stand the stems in a vase or container of warm water. Place the vase or container holding the berries on their stems inside an upended box. Spray the berries with hair spray. Use a polyurethane spray varnish if you also want gloss. Arrange the berries.
For this project you’ll need a fine mesh strainer, 2/3 cup of quinoa seeds, a bowl, water, a tray or plate, cloth, and a sealed glass container or plastic bag. , You need to wash the quinoa seeds to remove the soapy outer coating, which is known as saponin. Quinoa should always be rinsed prior to sprouting and cooking.  Quinoa is small, so you need to make sure you don’t lose any grains. After rinsing the saponin from the quinoa, use a fine-mesh strainer to collect the rinsed quinoa while draining the soapy water into the sink. Transfer the quinoa to a seed sprouter or into a second bowl.  If you have a seed sprouter, you can transfer your quinoa to that at this time.	Gather your supplies. Rinse the quinoa seeds in a bowl. Use a fine mesh strainer to gather your quinoa. Add approximately two-thirds of a cup (approximately 113 grams) of quinoa seed to a second bowl.
Swamp coolers are rated by how much air the cooler can move, and is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM).  Multiply this figure by the height of your ceilings. Divide that number by 2 (120 for European measurements). The result is the CFM rating for the evaporative cooler you need. For example: If you have a 1,500 square foot home with 8 foot (2.4 m) ceilings:  1,500 square feet x 8 feet (2.4 m). ceilings = 12,000 ÷ 2 = 6,000 CFM. You need a unit rated at 6,000 CFM or higher.   Example 2, in CMS (cubic meters per second): If you have a 140m2 home with 3m ceilings:  140m2 x 3m ceiling = 420 ÷ 120 = 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in). You need a unit rated at 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in) or higher.	Calculate your CFM rating. Use this formula to calculate the CFM needed to cool your home:   Determine the area of the space you want to cool.
You want to make sure your car is in the best shape possible during the winter. You don’t want to break down when it’s snowing or below zero. That can be stressful! Take your car to the mechanic for a checkup, or do your own maintenance on your car.Common things that break during the winter include hoses, belts, water pumps, and spark plug wires. You should also check the tire pressure.  Dead batteries are not a good thing to wake up to on a cold morning. Another thing that you should check at the start of the winter is your battery. Old batteries may give out in the cold, or the charging system may not be working correctly. While you are checking the other parts of the car, you should check your battery.If you need to get a new battery, make sure it is powerful enough to start your car in the winter. During the winter, your car will have more difficulty starting than in the summer.  Antifreeze is important to keep your car running during the winter. Most cars will do best with a mixture of water and antifreeze. For most winter weather, 60 percent antifreeze and 40 perfect water will be fine. In extreme winter conditions, use 70 percent antifreeze and 30 percent water. This helps keep the engine cool while having a low freezing point.Check your manual for specific antifreeze type recommendations.  Having your wipers going out while on the road is no fun. If you live in an area with a lot of ice and snow, you should put winter wipers on your car. These wipers are heavy and are specially made to keep ice from collecting on the wipers.Before you turn off the car, make sure to turn off the wipers. Your blades can freeze on the windshield, which can mess up the motor of the wipers when you try to use them again.  If you live in an area where it snows often every year, you put snow tires on your car. Snow tires can be difficult to put on your car, so permanently mount them on steel rims that a tire shop can easily put on your car in winter.You can store the tires during the winter, or many tire shops will store the tires and rims for you.  Snow and icy conditions can make seeing out of your windshield difficult. If you drive behind a car, you may also get salt and road grime sprayed on your windshield. You need to put washer fluid in your car that is made for snow and below freezing temperatures.Winter formulas of washer fluid help remove snow and ice and doesn’t freeze.	Have your car serviced. Check your battery. Check the antifreeze. Replace your wipers. Buy snow tires. Fill up your windshield washer fluid.
The best type of lid to work with is the kind that comes from a yogurt, butter, or margarine container. Make sure that the lid is clean and dry.  Turn the lid over so that the inside is facing you. Fill the bottom with a thick layer of clear school glue.Make sure that there aren't any gaps or holes in the glue, or your suncatcher will fall apart.It may seem as though you are using more glue than necessary, but clear glue tends to shrink a lot as it dries.Do not use a clear, industrial-strength glue for this; you want to be able to remove the suncatcher from the lid when you are done. White school glue may also be used, but your finished suncatcher may look cloudy and not sparkle as much., You can arrange them randomly or in a pattern, but make sure that you fill the entire bottom of the lid in an even layer. To make a more interesting looking suncatcher, experiment with different sizes and colors.Make sure that the flat size of the gems is facing down.  Do not skimp on the glue during this step; this is what will hold your suncatcher together. Make sure that you fill all of the cracks between the gems, and don't worry if the glue covers the gems; the glue will dry clear., If it tends to get very dusty where you live, consider placing a cardboard box over the lid to keep the glue clean and dust-free.  Turn the suncatcher over, so that the back is facing you, and let it finish drying., Find an area near the edge of the suncatcher where the glue is thick. Thread some clear string through a needle, then push the needle through the glue.Tie the ends of the string into a loop.  You can hang the suncatcher from a suction cup that has a hook on it, or you can hang it from the window latch.Do not let this suncatcher get wet. The glue will dissolve.	Find a plastic lid. Spread a thick layer of clear school glue over the bottom of the lid. Arrange glass, flat-backed gems in the lid. Fill the lid the rest of the way with clear school glue. Wait 2 to 4 days for the glue to dry.Do not disturb the suncatcher during this time. Carefully peel the lid off of the suncatcher. Thread some clear through through a thick part of your suncatcher with a needle. Hang the suncatcher indoors in front of a window.
Keeping your back straight and your posture neutral will allow your diaphragm and lungs to expand properly as well as encourage air flow. Since your singing power originates in the diaphragm, making a point of relaxing the rest of the body will help you refocus your attention on the parts of the body that matter.   Make a special effort to relax your stomach. Resist the urge to hold or suck it in, as this will make your breathing unnatural. Using your thumb, push the larynx from side to side gently, allowing your vocal chords to loosen, thereby putting less stress on them when you begin to sing.  The diaphragm is a muscle beneath the lungs that contracts whenever you breathe in, allowing your lungs to expand into that space. Expelling air is therefore a question of allowing the diaphragm to relax in controlled, gradual manner. To test what it feels like to breathe through your diaphragm, bend over at the waist and sing. Notice the feeling in your stomach and the sound that you create.   Don't ever breathe in through your nose; it will make it harder to reach high notes.  Make nonsense sounds (ex. expelling air to forcibly flap your lips by and create a b-b-b-b-b or p-p-p-p-p sound, making a prolonged "shhhhh" sound, and so on), covering different consonants and vowels to engage different facial muscles. This produces a richer, less strained sound. (When you blow up a balloon, it is much easier to stretch the balloon before blowing it up; your vocal chords function in much the same way.)  , Covering territory you're already comfortable with will continue to warm up your voice before you try to train it to do anything new. Consider choosing a song that has a few notes slightly above your usual range and make these your goal.  Remember that your vocal chords are delicate membranes and must be eased into any new techniques.  As you sing the note, press your lower belly in but keep your upper belly out; this is called a “lower belly boost.” Drop your lower jaw dramatically but keep your mouth opened narrowly. Bend your knees slightly to make yourself feel like you're moving downwards as your voice goes up. Try to minimize the height to which you lift your larynx up as you increase your pitch; though this is what people naturally do when raising their voices, this strains your throat and can cause your voice to crack. Monitor this by placing your fingers above your larynx while you sing and adjusting your technique to keep the larynx down.   Don’t look up while you sing high notes; keep your vision directly in front of you to avoid bending your throat and straining the sound. Sticking your tongue forward may help give the high notes a richer sound.  Don't try to force yourself into a much higher register too quickly; there are often serious consequences when you do. Remember to always drink water before a performance or practice, which will keep your voice steady. Keep one near you for emergencies as well.  To strengthen your singing voice, make good posture a habit, not a mode you switch into.; , Take up running or practise interval training to increase your lung strength and capacity.  Make funny faces, stretch your mouth and tongue in all directions, yawn to open the back of the throat, and loosen your jaw until you're able to push or pull on it with your hand. These exercises will help you shape and perfect the sound as it comes out of your mouth.	Sit or stand up straight with your muscles relaxed. Breathe from your diaphragm. Warm up before starting to sing. Start with songs that are in your vocal range. Practice scales, gradually increasing the pitch each time. Train your body to hit the high notes. Always remember to not strain your voice. Improve your posture. Get in shape. Develop facial flexibility.
Allow the fabric to absorb the soap and water without over-soaking the fabric (or it will become heavy and too soggy to create bubbles).    Instruct children to gently blow in a steady stream to achieve a constant, consistent flow of bubbles. If the fabric becomes too saturated with bubble mixture, remove it, wring out and replace.  Blow as many bubbles as you wish, adding more bubble mixture if needed.	Dip the fabric end of the bubble maker into the soapy water mixture. Blow on the other end of the bottle (the mouth) and watch the bubble snake emerge. Finished.
The marijuana plant’s resin can be difficult to wash off. Wearing disposable rubber gloves will protect your hands from its sticky buds., Marijuana plants are fragile and can be sensitive to rough treatment. Trimming your plant must be done carefully. Sharp sewing shears or a sharp kitchen knife should be adequate to trim your plant.Gardening shears are also commonly used to trim marijuana.Large fan leaves can be plucked with your fingers, as well as clipped with scissors or shears.  You should not simply discard the leaves you trimmed. They can be used to make marijuana foodstuffs or hashish. So before trimming your marijuana plants, set three cookie sheets or other wide containers near the plants you’ll be trimming. On one sheet, set untrimmed buds. On the second sheet, set newly trimmed buds. And on the last sheet, set the leaves and other plant matter you trim from the plant., The top of your marijuana plant should have a cluster of white hairs sticking out the top of it. These are the plant’s pistils, or reproductive organs. As the plant ages, these pistils will change from white to brown. When about 70% of the pistils have darkened to a reddish brown, your plant is ready for harvest., Most people trim their marijuana plants before drying them. This is known as a “wet trim.” A wet trim makes it easier to separate leaves from buds, and produces better-looking buds. However, some people trim the plants after the buds of the plant have dried. This is known as a “dry trim.” This is the preferred method of trimming in a low-humidity environment, since the leaves will slow the drying process and you want the buds to dry slowly.	Wear gloves. Use the right tools. Arrange a system to separate your trimmings. Harvest your plant at the appropriate time. Decide whether to wet trim or dry trim.
These tend to offer a snug fit and are available anywhere from H&M to dance apparel stores. A jersey material will work well once you accessorize the look.You could also wear a long-sleeved black shirt. Try to get a V-neck or scoop-neck style shirt that fits closely around your body. Tuck the shirt into your pants to make your look more seamless.; , These should fit you snugly. Ideally, the material will be leather; however, you can still rock the Black Widow look with black jeans.  The boots should be black, have three buckles that wrap around the leg at three different heights, and have either a low or wedge heel.  The jacket should have a front zipper and fit you tightly. A leather jacket will most closely resemble Black Widow’s look, but a pleather or suede material will also work.  Finding pre-made bullet bracelets will not be an easy task, since they are an unusual item. However, you can create your own a number of different ways:   Purchase a bullet belt from an online retailer like Amazon or from a costume store. Cut it so that it is small enough to fit around your wrist, and superglue this smaller section of the belt to a black bangle bracelet. You will need 2 bullet bracelets, one for each wrist.Spray-paint crayons black and gold. The coloring should be gold from the pointy, coloring end of the crayon to the middle and black from the middle to the flat top. Let the paint dry and superglue the crayons to two bangle bracelets. Similarly-shaped items, like toy drop whistles, will also work well when painted.  You can buy gold Crayola crayons in bulk from an online retailer like Amazon. This way, you only have to paint half the crayon black.  This is an accessory that adds to Black Widow’s edgy, unique style. The thigh holster should wrap around your hips and will ideally have three pouches, as in the movie. You can find a thigh holster online by shopping for SWAT or Tomb Raider costumes at stores like Spirit Halloween.   You can also look up holsters at an army supply store like OPSGEAR or Army Surplus World. Alternatively, you could superglue a black cell phone pouch to a black heavy-duty strap and tie the strap around your thigh.  You can purchase a prop gun online from a store like Replica Airguns or from a costume store. A cheaper option would be to purchase a toy gun - even a water gun - and paint it black., In addition to the thigh holster, Black Widow wears a belt that sits higher on the waist. This belt is broad, made of cloth, and has a plain silver quick release buckle in the center.Amazon sells heavy duty law enforcement belts that resemble the one worn by Black Widow, but a regular military-looking belt will do.  You can find a close approximation to the black, leather biker gloves worn by Black Widow at most stores which sell motorcycle accessories. A cheaper option would be to wear cloth fingerless gloves., Online retailers like WigIsFashion or wigs.com sell red wigs for around $60. Choose a style that is slightly wavy so as to most closely resemble Black Widow., While more time-consuming and permanent than wearing a wig, dyeing your hair can look more realistic. Black Widow’s hair color is a burnt red, so aim to find a dye that is not too flashy - the more natural the color looks, the more believable your costume will be.A semi-permanent dye, which you can buy at a retailer like Sally Beauty, is a good option if you want to wear the costume multiple times in the span of a few days or if you want a temporary change of look, as it will last you three to six weeks but won’t flake., Black Widow’s wears minimal makeup, so all you have to do to get the right lip color is apply a medium pinkish or peach lipstick. Try to choose a lip color that subtly enhances your own rather than one that is too bright or that looks unnatural.  Black Widow doesn't wear much makeup, but a generous amount of mascara does make her eyes stand out. Double-coat your lashes or add fake eyelashes to enhance your Black Widow look.   Line your eyes with black eyeliner for even more definition.There are several tutorials on YouTube that you could use to guide your eye makeup application - simply look up “Black Widow makeup” to get the most relevant results.	Find a long-sleeved bodysuit or leotard. Wear a pair of black skinny jeans or leggings. Wear knee-length leather boots. Complete the look with a black moto jacket. Create bullet bracelets. Find a thigh holster. Get a fake gun. Wear a buckled belt. Add fingerless gloves to complete your look. Try on a red wig. Dye your hair. Apply lipstick. Put on mascara.
The more mild your soap is, the less likely it is to have a harmful effect on your plants. Stay away from anti-bacterial, scented, and other specialized soaps.  Combine the soap and water using your hands or a large spoon.  You may not be able to fit all of the solution into a bottle, but you should use the largest bottle you can find to make use of as much of the solution as possible.  Spray a small section of the infested plant with the solution and monitor it throughout the course of a day. If it does not wilt or change color, the solution is likely safe.  Cover the top and undersides of leaves, focusing on the areas that seem the most overcome. This spray works by paralyzing insects, making them unable to eat.  Since this pesticide is fairly diluted, continued application is the only way to ensure that the infestation ends.	Opt for a mild liquid dish-washing soap. Mix a few teaspoons (10 to 15 milliliters) of your selected soap into 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. Pour the solution into a large squirt bottle. Test the mixture on your plants. Spray the entire plant. Continue to spray your plants every two to three days for the next two weeks.
Starting with tropical grasses or leaves gives you a base for the rest of your flowers. Big tropical leaves like ginger foliage or virions are a great option for this.Keep in mind that your bouquet will need to match the size of your greenery, so if you’re aiming for a small bouquet, use less greenery, or smaller leaves.  For a loose bouquet, you’ll want to build it from back to front. This prevents any of your flowers from getting lost in the arrangement., You’ll want to place your smaller flowers in bunches of threes. Generally it’s best to place them in the center, and to each side of the larger blooms., You can use smaller flowers up front and near the bottom of the bouquet – this allows them to be seen and also doesn’t overwhelm the bouquet in any one spot., To keep the bouquet together, you can loosely tie fabric around your stems. Don’t wrap them with wire, as this will give you a tighter look and will ruin the arrangement. Once your loose bouquet is finished, you can use it however you like - in a vase in your own home, as a hostess gift if you're attending a party at someone else's home, or even for a wedding.	Start with a base of greenery. Place your largest flower in front of the greenery. Frame the larger flowers with smaller flowers. Vary the heights. Tie with fabric.
Decide on your route before you depart on your trip, even if it’s just across town. Asking for directions can tip off a would-be carjacker that you are lost and/or not paying attention to your surroundings. Plan ahead of time which route you will take and any stops you may need to make along the way.Choose the most direct routes possible, and mix up your routine so that you are not a predictable target for criminals., Avoid high crime areas, rural areas with less populated roads, and congested traffic spots.Look for a navigation app with the safety feature of avoiding high crime spots.If you notice a lot of cars in disrepair, graffiti, liquor stores, check-cashing stores, or tire skid marks on the street, you may be in a bad neighborhood., According to the National Crime Victimization survey, 25% of all carjackings happen in parking lots, parking garages or near commercial areas. Park in a spot close to the building’s main entrance and under a lot of light,avoiding areas that are visually obstructed by walls or large plants.Don’t sit in the car and go through receipts or have a conversation on the phone or with your child in the backseat. Get in, lock the doors and go.   Don’t put your seatbelt on while pulling out of a space. If something happens, you may need to get out of your car quickly. Instead, belt yourself as soon as you are out of the space and ready to drive.In parking garages, park close to the exit and back into the space. It’s easier to drive forwards than backwards in an emergency., Keep a GPS system in your car or a GPS app on your phone in case you get lost.Always have a charged cell phone with you. Even if it is not under a service contract, you can still use it to call 911 if necessary. Just keep in mind that if you do not have a wireless provider and your call with an emergency operator gets disconnected, you will have to call back because they cannot call you.	Plan your routes. Avoid trouble spots and driving in unfamiliar areas. Take extra care when parking in commercial areas. Have a cell phone or radio communication on you at all times.
Remember that this is going to be outside with a bunch of hot sweaty and smelly people so before you go take a shower, you're probably going to want another one when you get home.; , Almost all amphitheaters let you bring in at least one sealed bottle of water. Some people have entered with a gallon jug of water because it was sealed.  If you burn easily bring sunscreen and don't wear black clothes or long sleeves, especially in the summer. People wearing long sleeves have been known to beg friends for cash to buy a shirt because it gets so hot.  Mosh pits can get pretty dangerous and they form fast. Keep watching the area around you. A mosh pit is pretty scary if you've never been in one before or if you just don't like being in them. The area around them for a good 15–20 yards (13.7–18.3 m) can also be bad to stand in as you could get hit or trampled of people wanting to be in it. If one forms around you and you have to get out, get out fast and don't worry about your blanket, trying to get it will more than likely end up in you getting your head stepped on.  If it rains enjoy it as it really cools you down.  Try not to get too close to the front of the stage. Seeing as that's where most people go, it's way hotter there and that's where mosh pits like to form and you will get hurt it's also very crowded.  Rather than blowing your money on that $10.00 cheeseburger, save it for a shirt. If you don't have enough for a shirt, you could possibly buy one in the parking lot for about $10.00. Some people had the experience of buying t-shirts for $4 each, instead of the usual $20.00 because they waited to buy them. But be aware that if you wait too long for that price to go down, you might not get the shirt that you wanted: as t-shirts sometimes sell out very quickly.  Check online or phone to see if the venue allows backpacks. Concerts sometimes have free stuff and you don't want to carry it around all day. You also might bring a notepad and a disposable camera (outdoor venues usually let you bring one) to get pictures with bands you might be able to meet because wouldn't it suck to meet a great band with no paper for them to sign and no camera with which to get a photograph?  , It's rude to other people who may be enjoying the band - it makes them hate you. People can be very touchy about the musicians they like.	Take care of personal hygiene. Bring water. Bring sunblock. Be vigilant for mosh pits. Check the weather. Don't stand too close. Buy a shirt. Bring a backpack. If a band you hate is performing, don't scream at them to get off the stage, or that they need to die.
Use a giant hole punch to punch out large circles.   Consider having an assortment of an even number of newspaper and cardstock circles on hand before you start to design.; , You could create a pattern where every other circle is newspaper followed by a cardstock circle or you could randomly add newspaper––get creative!  , Use enough glue without saturating the circles (too much and the Mod Podge could bleed through).	Create several giant newspaper and cardstock circles. Visualize the design of circles on the lampshade before adding glue. Glue the circles directly onto the lampshade using Mod Podge. Allow the lampshade to dry completely before use.
The reason why most people get stage fright is fearing they're gonna make a mistake. So, if you know your song inside and out, the anxiety should go down. Make sure you choose a song that fits your vocal range (you could add a note out of your range to wow your audience!) But, don't strain your throat!; , This article is based on singing (but some of these tips apply for all). Sing a scale in your range and go from there. When you're in public you can hum to warm up your voice. Humming can be used if you're speaking also and is a great substitute for singing your scales. Also, if your song doesn't go in a scale order or if you want a challenge, try singing "do, me, so, ti, re, ti, so, me, do" and etc. Or you can practice dynamics with your voice and etc.  Make sure you don't drink milk this day. It clogs up your throat. Instead, drink water. Make sure you warm up and run through your song a few times (don't do it too much because you will strain your throat!). While waiting to perform, breathe slowly. Don't talk to anyone who will distract you or let you down. Do calm exercises like yoga, deep breathing, and etc. Thirty seconds or so before you go on. Drink a small gulp of water and stay quiet. You might be REALLY nervous. When you perform, look slightly above the audience, judges, and etc. So you'll be performing to the wall!  , While performing or practicing, if you make mistakes then don't be hard on yourself. Take it easy. If you give that mistakes too much of attention its most likely going to drive you to make more mistakes. So when you make a mistake while you are performing...  Accept that you made a mistake. Move on.  As clichéd as this is, have fun! You're doing something you love! Put your heart into it! But if you mess up, that's ok. Everybody makes mistakes. If you stay calm about it. They might not have noticed. If your voice cracked, it's not the end of the world!	Practice Makes Perfect. Warm Up. The big day!, Its ok to make mistakes. Have fun!

How many people will be sheltering in your home during the power outage? How many pets will you be caring for during the power outage? Do you have infants? Does anyone in your household, including pets, take medications? Does anyone in your household require special medical equipment, such as an oxygen concentrator? Do you have cold-blooded pets, such as snakes or lizards, that rely on a heat source to survive? Do you have a heat source that does not require electricity, such as a wood stove? Do you have an alternative power source, such as a generator?; ,   If you have a woodstove or fireplace, make sure it is in good working condition. Have the chimney cleaned. Stock up on dry firewood and kindling. Consider purchasing a portable propane or kerosene heater that is meant for indoor use. Make sure you have plenty of fuel for the heater. Always use a battery-powered carbon monoxide detector when using an alternative heat source.    You will need about one gallon of water for each adult, child, and pet per day. Food should not require cooking or refrigeration, and should provide balanced nutrition. ,,,,,,	Assess your needs. Prepare a safe alternative heat source. Stock up on enough food and water to last 1 to 2 weeks. Stock up on medications.  , Stock up on other items unique to your household such as:   Diapers Baby formula Cat litter  , Purchase fresh fuel for your generator, if you have one.  , Purchase a backup power source for medical devices.  , Stock up on fresh batteries for flashlights.  , Purchase a battery-powered or hand-crank powered radio.  , Charge your cell phones and other devices.
With every beat of the music, you'll pop a shoulder. "Pop" here meaning move it up and out to the side quickly. The rest of your body should sort of flow with each pop -- it's not only your shoulders that are moving.   You're sort of moving your shoulders in arch, starting from the inside and going out. When you pop your left shoulder, your right hip should jut out. The hips should follow behind the shoulder by just a split second.  If you're popping your left shoulder first, go left, right, left. Then pop right, left, right. If you're working with music that's 4/4, you'll be using the half-beats, or the and of 1 and 2 (for example).   Start going faster and faster. Electronic dance music can be really, really, fast and keeping time is absolutely imperative.  When you pop your shoulders, your arms should be bent at the elbows, with your forearms and hands going toward the other direction. So when you pop left, through your arms right. When you pop right, throw your arms left. Keep your hands in a loose fist.   When you pop a shoulder, it moves up a bit. To exaggerate this, move the other shoulder down a bit. When you add in your arms, this looks especially good and loosens you up. Your arms will then be at slightly different levels.  Keeping the same basics (popping shoulders and opposite arms), get creative. Move your arms to shoulder level or even above your head. Add in a hand movement on the beats (dirt off your shoulder, maybe?) to jazz it up. It's still the Harlem Shake!   When you're working with music that's 4/4 (as most music is), alternate between working in threes (hitting pop, pop, pop on 1 and 2, 3 and 4), and working in twos (hitting pop, pop on 5, 6). So you might pop your shoulders five times on 1, and, 2, 3, 4 and then five more times on 5, and, 6, 7, 8.  The Harlem Shake is a dance move that goes back to the 80s -- it's not just some recent YouTube phenomenon, despite what your friends may tell you. The video craze just involves dancing wildly and has nothing to do with this dance move.   However, if you want to get creative, do the Harlem Shake while you're making a Harlem Shake video. Only a few people will understand what you're doing, but they'll appreciate it!	Alternate popping shoulders, left and right. Do it in threes. Start using your arms. Add personality to it. Know that this is different than the video craze.
Try to meet the director and tell them about your interests, training and desires.; , You don't necessarily need to love a character to play them well.  They take more effort and more memorizing, and if you are a beginner, it might be too much for you to handle. Many actresses started small, but were noticed in minor roles by talent scouts.  It might be helpful to you later, if you get either of the parts.  This will also tell you how long you have to practice.  Here are some good questions.   Do you need to have a song or monologue prepared? How long will the audition take? What roles are available? Will there be accompaniment or do you have to bring in a karaoke CD?  , Don't sing anything like rap or a rock song because it is a major turnoff for a casting director (unless that is what they're looking for.) If the show is something energetic such as Legally Blonde the Musical, you'll want to do an upbeat musical theatre song, not a ballad. Usually, they'll ask for about 16 measures (they can be 16 measures in a row that show off your range the best). Make sure it fits your range.   At other times you'll be given a song. In that case you will probably get it beforehand, if you don't ask.  It doesn't have to be well-known, and if you mess up, don't let the directors know. Make something up, and when you remember the correct lines, begin to get back on track.  If you aren't the best dancer, pretend to be. Sometimes personality can make up for your terrible dance moves. Always try your best and don't get discouraged if people move really fast. Smile!  , Often, the director(s) will not show much reaction to your performance, but that doesn't mean they aren't paying attention. If they cut you off midway through a song or monologue, it means they have heard enough to judge you on, not that you're bad.    Apologize Stammer Flinch Prattle Stare into the director's eyes Squeal Try to make conversation Beg Brag Kiss up/compliment Go overboard Scurry in/scurry out Act overly excited or hyper Act sluggish or bored Exhibit any obnoxious behavior  , However, don't be too perky, that can come off as desperate and annoying.  Think of it as a showcase of your talent or a show you're putting on- that can help.  It's fun! In musicals, the ensemble makes up most of the cast. Extras require less rehearsal time, and they have more dancing, singing, costumes, scenes, and general camaraderie, not to mention they don't have to worry about forgetting a thousand lines.  Just because you didn't get a part doesn't always mean you don't deserve it, or that you are less talented than the person who did. Accept whatever happens with grace and never demand another audition. Always be kind and respectful to the directors, and the person who got the part you wanted, even if you are cursing at them inside. But try to avoid that too.  Most tryouts are for main parts only - i.e., they're going to ask you to do a scene between the two lovebirds or a monologue for the main character of your gender.    Does your character have an accent? If so, should you try to replicate it? Is the character messy or neat? Does he/she have a spring in his step or does he/she mope around? Is he/she mischievous? Does he/she say lines confidently or is he/she less confident? When asked beforehand, these kinds of questions can give you a head start.  This can be good, because it gives you the adrenaline boost you need. The most important thing is to channel that energy into your performance.   If you are too nervous, you will need to calm yourself down. Deep breathing helps some people, so does biting your tongue, or shaking yourself. Different things work for different people. It doesn't matter how nervous you are, you need to make sure the other people who are auditioning can't tell. Be an actor and hide it. Directors will 'take into account' that you are petrified, because if they assume that if you can't act in front of three people, you won't be able to do it in front of a hundred. Whether this is true or not doesn't matter in an audition setting -- hide it.  People act differently in restaurants in Hello Dolly than they do in the library in Music Man." Keep these things in mind and keep your mind off the butterflies. Instead of remembering all the details, just absorb the scenarios you've practiced. You will be fine!	Find out the name of the musical and either find a script, movie or CD to give you a full understanding of the types of characters involved. Choose two characters you think you could play well. Remember not to limit yourself to starring roles. Ask yourself why you chose these two characters or the main one and write your answer in a pad. Find out the specific date/time of your audition and the scheduled performance dates so you'll know if you have anything that will interfere with the shows. Ask how the audition process will go. Pick a song that's right for your voice type and show you are auditioning for. If a monologue is required, find something you can connect with. Dance. Remain confident and friendly. Never do the following things. Always portray yourself as poised, confident, calm, and happy. Try not to be disappointed if you are placed in the chorus or ensemble. Remember- sometimes, these things are unfair. Get in touch with the main characters. Think about the details for the character you're playing. You will always be nervous before an audition. Before auditions, find something that will help you focus on what you're going to do - something called "getting in character," which means you need to know who you are, where you are in time and where you are as a character.
The warp consists of strands of yarn or thread strung lengthwise, under tension, across the loom. The ideal warping thread has a slight spring to it. Choose wool yarn, strong cotton thread, or a non-traditional warping material, like grape vine., When warping a standard frame loom, start in the bottom left corner of your loom. Double-knot the end of your thread or yarn to the bottom cross-bar of your loom frame. Pull the piece of thread or yarn under and over the top cross-bar. Bring it down to the bottom cross-bar and loop it under and over.While the thread or yarn should be pulled tight, you must be able to lift the warp with one finger. When warping a cardboard loom, begin in the top left corner. Secure the warp thread to the back of your cardboard loom with a piece of masking tape—the tail should reach the middle of the board. Insert the thread into the first slit in the top left corner. Pull the warp thread to the bottom left corner and insert it into the first slit. Wrap the thread around the back of the cardboard loom and insert it into the next available top slit., Loop the thread or yarn around the top cross-bar followed by the bottom cross-bar in a figure-eight pattern.As you move from left to right, evenly space the loops across the cross-bars.Continue to wrap the warp thread around the cardboard loom. Insert the warp thread into the next available top slit, pull it down to the bottom, slide it into the next available bottom slit. Repeat., Create approximately 20 loops. When the thread or yarn reaches the top right corner of the loom frame, loop it around the top cross-bar and double-knot it. Cut the thread or yarn from the spool or ball if you have not done so already.After you have inserted the warp thread into each slit, pull the warp thread to the back of the cardboard. Cut the warp thread so that the tail hits the middle of the cardboard loom. Secure the tail to the board with masking tape. To maintain the warp’s tension, secure each piece of warp thread to the back of the cardboard with masking tape.	Select a warping thread. Begin the warp. Continue looping the thread or yarn. Complete the warp.
Getting a car loan is not impossible as a newcomer to the U.S., but there are some additional difficulties. Start out by shopping around, perhaps for a used car, that will be cheaper. If you can afford to pay cash, then you won’t need to worry about financing.; , If you need a car loan, understand that different banks or credit unions have different requirements regarding prior credit history. You will want to shop around and ask. It is possible to get a loan as a foreigner. Just be prepared that you may need to pay a bit higher interest rate.  There may be shipping restrictions across borders by the lender while debt is owed. In addition, if you're planning to take the car out of the United States, foreign countries may lack repair facilities for your vehicle or require engine modifications before you can legally drive.  Before you move to the United States, begin researching "expat car leasing and financing companies." You will find a variety of companies, like 24Expat,Expatride,International AutoSource,and many others. These companies offer financing and leasing rates to expats at competitive local prices. If possible, contact a company before you move to the US to take advantage of special offers and savings.  Many buyers may not realize that banks are not the only lenders. Most new car dealers will also handle their own financing. In some cases, if you finance your car purchase through the dealer, you may be able to get a better rate than you could get at a bank or other finance company. Research the conventional lenders first, and then keep these numbers in mind when you are shopping for cars., Work with the expat car service to get a better understanding of which of these options work best with your visa length and planned stay time in the country.  In order to drive in the United States, you will need a recognized form of driver's identification. If you have a foreign license written in English, you can use this license as a visitor or for a time after you become a resident (the specific time varies by state). However, if your license is in another language, you will have to get an International Driving License (IDL) from your home country before you visit the U.S. If you plan to immigrate, you will need to exchange your foreign license for a U.S. one within a certain amount of time. Residents of the following countries may do so easily through reciprocity agreements:   Canada. France. Germany. South Korea., In most of the U.S., you are required to have car insurance in order to drive. Before you are able to drive your new car away from the dealership, you will have to show proof that you are insured.New Hampshire is the only state that does not require car insurance,but even they highly recommend it., Although generally we say that every state requires you to have automotive liability insurance, the minimum requirements are different from state to state. In addition, lenders will usually require comprehensive and collision insurance for new cars. You will need to identify the requirements for the state where you intend to buy and register your car., Shop around, before you come to the U.S. or after you arrive, to find the best rates. Your expat car service should be able to help you secure auto insurance at an affordable rate., When buying a car, you will want to consider such things as the size (how many people are in your family?), the distance you will need to travel, and whether good gas mileage is important to you.  Take the time to research and become familiar with your vehicle options. Available manufacturers in the U.S. may differ from your home country. Consider asking your expat car service representative questions about the available vehicles.  In the U.S., prices for most items are set by the merchant and are not negotiable. Cars are different. Cars are listed with a “sticker price” (that is the price on the sticker posted in the car’s window). Most dealers, however, expect that you will make an offer that may be a few thousand dollars less than the sticker price. For a used car, there is usually even more room for negotiation. Some keys to good negotiation include:Research the car you want before you begin negotiating. After you have completed your shopping and you believe you have found the car you want, research it thoroughly. Using online sources like KellyBlueBook.com or Edmunds.com, you can look up the values of both new and used cars. These will give you a starting place for your negotiating. Have a target price in mind. Before you begin the process, you should know what you want to pay, and then a higher amount that you might be willing to pay. Use leverage to your advantage. When you are negotiating a price for a car, let the salesman believe that you are willing to walk away and go buy a different car from someone else. If they know they might lose your business, they may be willing to lower the price. Focus on the car’s price, not the monthly payments. Many car salesmen will try negotiating the price in terms of monthly payments, rather than the total. If you do this, you run the risk of adding thousands of dollars to the price without really noticing it. Keep the conversation focused on the total price., Almost all professional car dealerships, whether you are buying a new or a used car, will do the work of registering a car and getting the license plates for it., Each state has a Department of Motor Vehicles (or it may be referred as Department of Transportation, Registry of Motor Vehicles, or some other similar name). If you are handling the registration yourself, you will need to contact this office or review its web site and find out their specific requirements for car registration.   A handy site with contact information for all 50 states is DMV.org.  In most states, before you can register your car, you will need to get the following pieces of information:A registration application, which you can usually download from your state’s DMV web site. The title for the new car, showing your name as the owner. A lien might be on title if it has been financed. Proof of a satisfactory vehicle inspection. In most states, every car must pass a safety inspection in order to be registered. Some states also require an emissions or pollution test as well. You will need to take the car to a licensed mechanic or testing center to get inspected.  If you have not registered the car yet, you will not be able to drive it to the inspection location. If you are buying a used car, you will probably drive the car with the seller’s license plates to the inspection site, and then you will be able to get your own registration.   Proof of insurance. Payment for sales tax and other registration fees. Check with the DMV web site in your state to determine what this will be. It varies from state to state.  If, after you are through in the U.S., you choose to return home with your American-bought car, there are essentially three different choices for shipping. They vary based on time, cost, and security.Roll On, Roll Off (RORO): Vehicles are driven directly onto a ship and are lashed down. The travel time across the ocean (from the east coast to Europe, or from the west coast to Asia) is approximately two weeks. The cost is reasonable, but there is a risk of damage or theft. Containerized Shipping: About six cars at a time are loaded into a closed, locked container, which is then loaded onto a ship. This is a more expensive alternative but provides added security than the RORO method. Air freight: This is the most secure and fastest method of shipping your car. It is also the most expensive.  You will need to show the title that you received when you purchased the car, showing your name as the vehicle's owner, in order to go through Customs. If you purchased the car at an auction (primarily for dealers), you would need the auction gate release and a report from the DMV showing that the title is clear., Many shipping companies recommend that you remove any personal property from inside the car before shipping it. At least one source suggests that you protect your car seats and dashboard with plastic sheeting.You also need to deliver the car to the shipper with as little gas left in the tank as possible., Before shipping take these items off the car. Make sure that you have the title and registration, along with any other private information or personal identifying paperwork, with you before you leave the car with the shipping company. Take these materials with you then when you pick up your car at your destination.	Shop for a car you can afford. Research the lenders’ credit requirements. Consider where the car will eventually be based. Try an expat-specific financing company. Compare bank rates with dealer lending rates. Consider leasing as an alternative to buying. Make sure you can legally drive in the U.S. Understand the obligation. Find out the insurance requirements for your state. Secure affordable auto insurance. Consider your needs. Research your options. Negotiate the best price you can. Let the dealer handle it, if you are buying from a dealer. Contact the Department of Motor Vehicles for the state where you reside. Collect the information that you will need to register your car. Select the type of transport. Clear your car through US Customs as part of shipping it. Protect your car and personal property for the voyage. Remove your license plates and personal papers from the car.
It’s important to choose a plant that will thrive where you place it. You may not have a location that’s right for a shrub you want, but you can evaluate the available space to choose a plant that’s perfect for that spot. Before you buy your plant, take time to evaluate what type of shrub will thrive in the location you choose. Make notes of sun exposure, temperature fluctuations, soil moisture, root growth area, and soil composition and acidity. Ask someone at the nursery or garden center to help you choose the right plant.   Is the shrub being planted near your house, garage, or taller plants that will block out sunlight at certain times each day? Every plant needs a specific amount of sun and shade, so it’s important to note how much sunlight the shrub will receive. Set up a thermometer and mark down the temperature at different times to determine how much the temperature fluctuates. Measure the distance from the location you intend to plant to the closest objects on all sides. Roots spread laterally, so the amount of space around the planted location will determine how much room the plant has to grow. Keep in mind that other plants nearby may compete for water and nutrients in the soil.You can purchase kits to test pH at your local nursery. For optimal growing conditions, you should maintain a pH between 5.8 and 6.5.; , Shrubs are decorative plants, so you want to take advantage of their cosmetic appeal. Use your shrub to conceal unsightly objects on your lawn like air conditioning units. Create privacy by planting a row of tall hedges, or improve the curb appeal of your home with an attractive shrub near the door., New plants come in three varieties, balled and burlapped or B&B shrubs, bare roots shrubs, and containerized shrubs. You’ll need to measure the height of the roots from the ground to the “root flare,” part of the shrub at the base of the trunk where roots begin to spread out. This process is simplest for those shrubs that are bulbed and burlapped or containerized because the roots are tightly confined. Bare roots shrubs take a little more time and effort, but it’s important to measure properly to ensure adequate space for healthy root production.For bulbed and burlapped and containerized shrubs, place the handle of a shovel across the top of the rootball. The distance from the shovel handle to the ground is how deep the hole should be. The hole should be three to five times wider than the rootball at its widest point. For a containerized plant still in its pot, you can simply measure the height of the pot and subtract any space between the top of the pot and the dirt.For bare roots shrubs, find the darker line around the main trunk of the plant. This is where the plant was previously at ground level, and this line should be replaced at or slightly above ground level. Measure from this line to the bottom of the root system. Spread the roots over the ground gently. Try not to break or bend the roots unnaturally. It may be easiest to create a small mound of dirt, and spread the roots over the sides with the highest point of the mound below the trunk. Measure across the widest point of the root spread. The hole should be three to five times wider than the spread., Once you’ve measured the rootball you want to offer the newly planted roots soft soil that does not prevent or hinder growth. Dig out the soil, and place it on a tarp. Then, thoroughly break up the soil until it is has a granular appearance. Don’t till the earth deeper than is necessary. You’ll want the bottom to be solid to prevent shifting. Make sure the sides of your hole slope out from the middle and do not have a “glazed” appearance. Shoveling compacts the dirt, and the smooth looking soil may block out water or make it difficult for roots to grow., Once you have a hole of the right size, fill it with water. If the water completely drains away within 24 hours, you have good drainage and can place your shrub. If not, wait for the water to completely drain, and attempt the test again. If there is still standing water after 24 hours, consider planting in a different location.	Consider possible locations. Choose an attractive spot. Measure the roots. Dig the hole. Assess drainage.
This will make the lace appear as if it is running on and on without a break, which is ideal for items such as bags and stuffed toys. It won't always be possible but it's the first preference.; , The most common method for joining lace end to end is to overlap the ends and then over-sew the edges.   Turn the cut ends of the lace under if they're more than an inch (2.5cm) wide, before sewing.  Where the lace is wider (2.5" to 6" / 6-15cm), cut around the lace pattern with care on both ends of the lace and stitch together using stick-on adhesive to keep in place, as is done with wedding lace motifs. That way you can be sure it won't shift during sewing and the join will be perfect.	Seek to make an invisible join where possible. Overlap the lace. Treat very wide lace slightly differently.
You will need to remove the air filter housing to expose the carburetor, there may be a suitable screwdriver or ring spanner or socket and ratchet/ breaker bar needed to remove securing screws.; , You are attempting to drain the fuel tank. All fuel tanks have at least two fuel lines attached.   One pipe sucks fuel from the bottom of the tank, the other is the return pipe it returns unused fuel from the engine. All modern automobile engines have fuel pumps to suck fuel up to the engine. You need to determine whether your engine uses a mechanical or electrical fuel pump. Mechanical fuel pumps are bolted onto the engine block or cylinder head.  Electrical pumps can be located anywhere but are mostly submersed in the fuel at the bottom of the fuel tank. If you take the cover off the fuses usually located under the steering wheel and look at the sticker and see any reference to a fuse for the fuel pump then you have an electric fuel pump.    It is connected to the fuel filter that may be visible. Since all modern cars have anti-siphon devices fitted underneath the filler cap of the fuel tank you will use the cars fuel pump to drain the unsuitable fuel. Mechanical fuel pumps only function when the engine is turning over. It is not advisable to turn the engine over as the battery would be well flat before the tank would be drained out the fuel line. If the car has an electrical fuel pump you may be able to short circuit a wire from the horn or hazard warning or blower circuit into the electric fuel pump circuit after removing two fuses. The pump will then empty our the fuel line and into a seven up or cocoa cola bottle which you will fit over the end of the line. If this does not work then fill a bottle with petrol and make a hole with the thinnest needle you can find near the bottom. Have a comrade crank the engine while you let the stream of petrol that leaks out the hole over the carburetor. When the engine starts and runs on the fine stream stop cranking. The engine will proceed to run and power the fuel pump thus draining the tank. Obviously on engines with a mechanical pump the line would have to be disconnected on the side not hooked to the filter or the pump could not do its job. , Let the starter cool after each session for perhaps two to three minutes. When the engine starts and warms up there may be a slight miss until the last vestige of contaminated fuel in the newly mixed tank is expended.	Lift the hood/bonnet. Drain the fuel tank. Locate and remove the fuel line from the carburetor that is supplying the fuel. When the line is no longer pumping, fill the tank up with appropriate fuel and put everything back together the way you found it.  , Crank the engine until it starts for no more than twenty or 30 seconds at a time or you risk burning out the starter.
Unfortunately, there is no standard procedure when taking bikes on public transit. Some trains allow it, some only on certain hours, and other never at all. Coupled with any transitions you might make, such as switching to a bus or light-rail, and it may seem easier to skip the bike altogether. However, knowing your entire route in advance will make planning far easier. Google and Apple maps, for example, have extensive public transportation and bike maps that let you know all available routes, even mixed routes, after you type in your destination address.   If you need to take a bus, does the bus system accept bikes? How far are you traveling when you get off the train? It might make more sense to lock the bike at the station if you get right off at your destination.; , Find out if there are any fees, restrictions, or requirements. The most frequent restrictions include:   Only riding in bike-designated cars. No bikes during peak hours, frequently 8-10AM and 4-6PM No bikes on crowded or packed cars., Getting your bike up and down the stairs, through turnstiles, and on the train will inevitably take a little extra time, so plan accordingly. For short trips, and extra 5-10 minutes should be more than enough to get you there on time.Many stations do not let you bring a bike on an escalator for safety reasons, so be prepared to potentially haul up and down stairs.  Purchase the fare for your trip, including fees for bringing your bike. Many trains require an additional amount to cover the bike.   If you can't get in the turnstile with your bike, signal the attendant. You can usually swipe your card/pay the fare, then enter through the emergency or handicapped entrance after paying., Stand with your bike on the platform behind the boarding line until the train comes to a stop. Wait for other passengers to exit and enter before boarding.  Stow it away from doors and aisles, in a position where it won’t fall over and you can keep a hand on it. Try to turn the handlebars so that the wheels are in a straight line, out of the way of as many people as possible.   Use bike racks on the train if they are available, which usually involve wedging or lifting your front wheel into a small rack. If there are other bikes on the train, place your front wheel near their back. These allows the bikes to fit together better and keeps the handlebars from jamming into each other. Be sure your bike is secure if you're not holding it yourself. Don't leave it where other passengers can trip over it or run off with it. Make sure you can keep an eye on it.  The unwritten rules of a good train passenger will keep everyone happier as you move too and fro. When carrying a bike, let others on and off before you, respect the rules (no riding during rush hour or on crowded trains) and politely ask people move or adjust their bikes if you think you can fit them more snugly. And, if the ride is short and the train is crowded, just ride home. That's why you have the bike, after all.	Plan out your route ahead of time, including transitions, walking, biking, and time of day. Call ahead or check your train's website to see if they accept bikes. Allow extra time to get to your destination. Pay the correct fare. Stand on the platform. Board the train with your bike, standing along the side. Follow subway and train etiquette.
You'll need 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of white glue (also called school glue) and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of liquid starch, the kind that's used to starch shirts. These ingredients will give you a small batch of sticky tack. If you want a larger batch, just remember to use the ratio of 2 parts glue and 1 part starch.  Put them in a container and use a spoon to mix them together. The mixture will immediately begin to stiffen, due to the interaction between the glue and starch. Soon it will form the consistency of sticky tack.  Use blue or another fun color to color your sticky tack if you'd like. Add just a few drops, since a little goes a long way. Stir it in so that the ball of sticky tack gets thoroughly colored.  Scoop the sticky tack into your hands and knead it so that it becomes firm, but pliable. If you think it feels a little sticky, work in a little more starch. If it's too dry to stick, add a bit more glue. Keep working the sticky tack until it reaches the consistency you want.  Pinch of a few small pieces to hang a poster or picture. You can store the sticky tack you don't use in an airtight jar or another container. If it gets a little dry before you use it again, you can add more glue and work it in with your hands to achieve the right texture again.	Measure out your glue and starch. Mix the glue and starch. Add a few drops of food coloring. Knead it with your hands. Use or store the sticky tack.
Oftentimes, theaters will list their phone number online as well as their current and upcoming movie showings. Choose which showing you would like to go to from their online schedule.   If you are going to larger theater chain, such as AMC, be sure to obtain the number of the theater that is located nearest to you. Once you've chosen your theater and showing, jot down their phone number.; , Let them know exactly which movie and what time you would like to go. Some theaters only allow you to buy your ticket a certain number of days ahead of time so be sure to inquire about any specific regulations.   If the theater requires you to wait to reserve a ticket then be patient and call back as soon as you are allowed to (for some theaters, this may be the day of the showing). You can even set a reminder on your phone if it’s for a movie you think will be particularly crowded and difficult to get a ticket for. Blockbuster releases that are in high demand may have available tickets and showtimes up to a month in advance,so don’t be afraid to ask if there’s an upcoming movie that you’re dying to see and want to reserve tickets for far in advance.  Some theaters will allow you to reserve your ticket ahead of time and you can pay when you arrive while others will require your credit card information over the phone to charge you at the time of calling. It’s best to have that information readily available so that you don’t lose your spot.   If you don’t have a debit or credit card, ask to borrow a friend or family member’s and then pay them back in cash.	Search online for nearby theaters. Call the cinema. Have your credit card handy.
For the best results, bypass the analog connection entirely and connect your guitar digitally to your computer. You can connect your guitar digitally to your computer through a pre-amp with a USB or Firewire outport. Before you purchase a pre-amp with one of these out ports, check to see if the guitar accessories you already own will work. These accessories may include amp-modelers, pedals, drum machines, and direct boxes., Place your standard guitar cable into your guitar. Plug the opposite end of the guitar cable into the pre-amp’s input port. Insert a USB, Firewire, or Optical cable into your pre-amp’s USB or Firewire out port. Plug the other end of this cable into your laptop’s USB or Firewire in port., When your guitar is properly connected, you will be able to assess the strength and quality of your guitar’s signal. Listen to the instrument through your computer’s speakers, a set of external speakers, or a pair of headphones. If you’re using external speakers or headphones, insert their respective cables into your laptop’s audio-out port. Play a few chords on your guitar to test the signal.This method will produce the crispest and clearest recordings.You may need to download and/or open recording software in order to hear your instrument. If your guitar’s sound is not coming through, make sure the instrument’s volume is turned all the way up. Open your computer’s sound settings and double check that your volume is not muted and that the correct port or device is selected (audio-in, audio-out, headphone, microphone, etc.). For specific instructions, consult your computer or device’s manual.	Purchase or find a pre-amp device with a USB or Firewire out port. Connect your guitar and pre-amp to your laptop. Test the signal.
A note can't be good if you can't sustain it. Before you work on your voice, you have to work on your breathing. Just like holding your breath comes easier with time, so does prolonged expulsion.   Start by breathing in for 4 counts and exhaling for 8. Increase the exhale by 4 until you hit 28. You're not stretching the capacity of your lungs; you are learning how to control the air.  Breathing out on a hiss will make it easier to control the air and give a tonal quality to the power behind it.  You wouldn't start a marathon without training, would you? Your vocal folds are muscles too! Show them the respect they deserve by warming up.   Start on middle C and practice going down in half steps until you hit the bottom of your range, working major scales. Then, take it back up to the top of your range. Use phrases like, "Mommy made me mash my M&Ms" to switch it up from the normal solfege (do, re, mi...). Practice lip trills and sirens. Start near the bottom of your range and slide your way up. This is especially useful for opening up the higher range.  As you do your siren, use your arms to give the higher range a physicality. Often it's easier to hit high notes if you can "see" them.  Too many pop singers are guilty of being overly nasal. If you modify your vowels, your voice will have a more classic, darker, developed tone that is more likely to sound trained.   Practice with multiple consonants. Start on ma, me, mi, mo, moo (that's pronounced like mah, meh, mih, moh, moo), and move to ta, te, ti, to(h), too. Then on with "z," "k," and "sh." At the "oo" sound, move up or down a half step and repeat until you hit the extremes of your range.  Each voice has a vowel that makes it easier to reach higher notes. Experiment to see which one makes it easiest for you.  Say you have a huge break between your chest voice and head voice; because of this, you avoid those three or four dangerous notes at all costs. As a result, the quality of those notes becomes very weak. In order to improve, you must take risks.   Go outside your comfort zone. If you're not comfortable with a certain range or length of note, practice it. It is the only way you will get better. Control will come with time. With enough practice, you'll be able to manipulate your voice into doing exactly what you want.  Sometimes our voices just aren't meant for certain notes. If you find yourself straining, either drop an octave or find a note in harmony.   Listen to what your voice is telling you. You may want horribly to be a soprano, but it just may not be in the cards. But remember: Your range does not determine how good your voice is. Sing with what you have--don't try to be something you're not.	Practice breathing exercises. Warm up adequately. Modify your vowels. Take chances. Sing in your range.
A partner or two in hallways with doors and T-intersections would be very appreciated as, at some point, you will be forced to turn your back on an area you have not yet cleared. You, however, as a private citizen, will likely have to clear it alone. Therefore, you must keep your eyes and ears open and balance multiple danger problems to keep your risk at a minimum. Don't be fooled though, this process, and the other processes in this article, all pose very high risk., Never make your way down the middle of a hallway. At the same time, keep from touching the walls. Hallways are similar to doorways, meaning that they are a narrow passage that an intruder may be expecting you to come through. The middle of the hallway is your fatal funnel.  Be aware, however, that stopping in a hallway to clear a room means that you have not cleared the rest of the hallway, and an unexplored (uncleared) area is now at your back.   Corners are no different, but what happens if there are two corners in two directions? This is a T-intersection. See the next section for more detailed information on how to clear a T-intersection.  The areas you have not cleared still contain danger points and you should be splitting some of your attention toward the uncleared areas.  Doing this means that you now have a room at your back that is uncleared, a hallway in front of you which is uncleared and the room you are intending you enter is also uncleared. This presents an overwhelming amount of danger zones. Placing yourself in this situation is unjustifiably dangerous.	Understand that hallways present some of the more difficult, dangerous, and dynamic areas of a building. Walk on one side of a hallway or the other. Handle obstacles such as doorways the same as mentioned above. Keep track of what areas you have cleared and which ones you have not. Methodically clear hallways — don't walk past one room to clear another.
Determine if their basic requirements make them incompatible (Such as high humidity frogs and low humidity cacti).; ,          An aquarium is basically a glass box that is only open at the top. Terrariums usually have hinged or sliding glass doors on one of the vertical sides to make access easier. You may also build your own enclosure. This can be done with glass and silicone, wood and epoxy, cement and epoxy, or a number of other ways. If humidity and temperature in your living environment are suitable, then you can water substrate for a plant at any level with a siphon (inverted-U) hose connecting to an aquarium. This arrangement can be raised, lowered or replaced according to root growth, substrate depth(s), and hydrophilic properties of substrate(s). If using plants that were previously potted plants, be sure to thoroughly flush out the roots with water to remove any toxic fertilizers before planting them in the vivarium.  Desert vivariums do not need a false bottom since there will be little watering.          A false bottom is an area for excess water to pool without drowning the plants roots. The two main types of false bottoms are filled vs. open false bottoms. A filled false bottom is a 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) layer of gravel or LECA with a screen on top to prevent dirt from entering. An open false bottom consists of a piece of egg crate supported by PVC, with a screen on top. Both styles are adequate methods with their own pros and cons.           These can be attached with silicone or hot glue; however, it is important that the dried adhesive is inert and cannot contaminate the vivarium with harmful chemicals. Possible background and hard-scape include: wood, cork-bark, rocks, disguised foam, disguised plastic, ornaments, or any number of other items. It is important that anything placed in the vivarium is clean and non-toxic. Items found outdoors must be cleaned before placing them in the vivarium.           A screen top usually prevents high moisture since the vivarium will take on the humidity of the room it is in; while a mostly glass top (90-95% glass, 10-5% screen) will keep the humidity level much higher. However, normal glass and screens blocks most UV light, thus UV lights must be placed inside the vivarium  ,          Plants require full spectrum lighting with a color temperature between 5000-7000K for best growth. Most 'normal' home lights are drastically less than 5000K while 'bluer' bulbs can be much higher Kelvin.           Equipment includes a thermometer, hydrometer, under-tank heater, in tank heater, pumps, filters, etc.           There are a large number of substrates available at pet-stores. Usually it is best to use these rather than collect anything from outdoors. Both plants and animals have substrate they prefer (do research!). A temperate or rain forest vivarium might have a layer of peat, fir bark, and black earth, followed by a layer of sphagnum moss, with a layer of leaves on top. A desert vivarium will probably have just a layer of sand with maybe some gravel in certain areas.           For temperate and tropical vivariums it is best to wet down the entire vivarium to make sure there are no overly wet areas. A desert terrarium will usually just have a water dish.           Remember, every plant has its own requirements; such as soil moisture, watering schedules, and light levels.           This will allow you to monitor the health of the plants and the functionality of your design without unduly disturbing the future animals. This is particularly important with water features.           This is important to prevent contaminating a vivarium that took a long time to build. A one to four week quarantine is suggested. ,	Decide what animals and plants you want to keep. Purchase a suitable sized aquarium or terrarium, remember animals like to move around and plants need room to grow. If this is a temperate or tropical vivarium build a false bottom. Install the background and hardscape. Install a top. Install a light. Install equipment. Add substrate. Add dechlorinated water. Plant the plants, leaving room for the plants to grow and 'fill in'. Turn on the vivarium and let it 'stabilize' for 24 hours to several weeks. Quarantine your newly purchased, and researched, animals to assess their health. Add your quarantined animals to the vivarium and monitor their acclimation closely for the first week or two.         , Sit back and enjoy your slice of the environment.
It is important to know your local and state laws before you begin to ride. A good course will not only cover state guidelines, but also review proper gear, tips for navigating hills and turns, and important life saving tips.  Always wear a properly fit helmet. The helmet should be snug and unable to move when the rider shakes their head. Chin harness must be secure, rider should feel pressure under their chin. The ATV safety institute recommends a long sleeve shirt, long pants, good gloves and boots that cover the ankle. Goggles are recommended; make sure they are free of scratches and fit securely around the head., Check the brakes and brake lights. Inspect the throttle. It must return to position immediately when it is released. Measure the air pressure in the tires; refer to the manufactures recommended level. Check headlights, always ride on a full tank of gas. Inspect the chains and drive shaft. Chain should have proper slack and lubrication. Nuts and bolts may loosen with ATV use, check to make sure they are snug., The places you will be riding generally won't be as well-kept as the roads, so be careful., Floods and rain cause poor traction, and in snow you may sink. Getting a strong headwind while riding fast could cause you to flip over., The momentum could throw you forward and lead to possible injury., When ascending, plant your feet firmly, keep a good grip on the handlebars and keep your weight toward the front of the ATV. When descending keep weight toward the rear of the ATV. Use your brakes gradually as you go down and look ahead at all times. Always maintain a safe speed; do not accelerate quickly. When traveling in a group, keep a safe distance between all riders especially on hills.,, Do not travel on public roads., Release the parking brake and slowly apply the throttle. Test the brakes one more time while going a slow speed., If your ATV begins to tip during a turn, lean your body further into your turn and gradually decrease speed., A quick sharp turn can lead to an accident.,	Take an ATV safety course.  Wear proper protective gear.  Inspect your ATV before every ride.  Be alert for anything your ATV can trip on.  Pay attention to weather conditions.  Avoid braking suddenly.  Use caution when going up and down hills.  No passengers should ride on a single ATV. ,  Let someone know where you plan to ride and an estimated time for your return.  Allow the engine to warm up before you begin.  When turning the ATV, decrease your speed and shift your body weight toward the inside of the turn.  Always make turns as wide as possible. Finished.
On most commercial patterns, the pattern is located in the top left corner. This number is used to identify the pattern design and size. Smaller pattern companies may replace the pattern number with a name., Sewing patterns are not one size fits all. Each pattern comes in multiple size ranges. Before purchasing a pattern, check the size range located to the right of the pattern number to make sure your size falls within the range., Pictures and or drawings of the garment will appear on the front of the pattern envelope. In addition to selling the garment, the images provide inspiration for fabric selection and information on how the garment is intended to fit. The images also depict design variations. The pattern contains the pieces necessary to create all of the variations., The design variations, also called “views,” also appear on the back of the envelope. These line drawings include more design details, such as darts, seam lines, and potential lengths. Each view is identified by a symbol, typically a letter. The symbol is used in charts and the pattern to identify information about that specific view., The back of the pattern envelope contains a list of fabrics suitable for this garment. Read through the list carefully. Select a fabric that is appropriate for the garment and that you are comfortable working with., In addition to fabric, your pattern may require notions and trims. The “Notions” section will list all of the additional pieces you will need to complete the garment. These may include items such as zippers, hook and eye closures, and elastic., Pattern sizing rarely aligns with ready to wear sizes. When cutting the pattern, you will follow lines for a specific size. Therefore, it is essential to accurately determine your size instead of assuming that you are a certain size.Use a measuring tape to measure various points on your body listed on the pattern envelope, such as your chest or bust, waist, and hips. Match your measurements to the measurements provided on the chart to determine your pattern size., The fabric requirements are listed directly below the body measurement and size charts. Locate the row containing the design variation you intend to create. Follow the row over until you reach the column containing your pattern size. The number in this cell is the amount of yardage you will need to complete the garment in your pattern size.   Most patterns will list alternative lengths for different widths of fabrics (45 inches wide v. 60 inches wide)., The last box in the chart contains information on the finished garment measurements. The finished garment will be slightly larger than your body measurements to allow for ease, or the fabric added to a garment so you may wear it comfortably. This information is often printed onto the pattern as well., The first page of the instruction booklet depicts images of the garment and its design variations. The line drawings show the front and the back of the garment. Under each drawing, you will once again find the garment’s corresponding symbol, typically a letter., Manufacturers often include line drawings of all the pattern pieces. Each image will be labeled, typically with a number. The number corresponds to a descriptive list located below the line drawings.   After reading the rest of the instructions, you may wish to mark which pattern pieces you will need., Prior to cutting and constructing your garment, devote time to reading the general sewing instructions thoroughly. This section contains information that may prevent you from making construction errors. It will provide you with details on items such as seam allowance and zipper insertion., Every design variation is accompanied with a corresponding cutting diagram. The layout depicts how all of the pattern pieces fit on the allotted amount of fabric.When viewing the diagram, make note of the following:   The grain line. The grain of the fabric runs parallel to the selvages of the fabric—the selvages are the finished edges of the fabric.. Each pattern piece will contain a line of arrows that corresponds to the grain line. Bent grainline symbols. If a grainline symbol is bent at the top, this means the piece should be placed on a fold. Double layer of fabric. A pattern may call for a specific piece to be cut out of a double layer of fabric., Unfold the pattern and lay it out on a flat surface. Retrieve your instruction book and turn to the cutting layout guide for your pattern. Use the cutting diagram to help you identify the pieces you will need for your garment.   The pattern pieces diagram may also be useful., Set your iron on low. Once the iron is preheated, iron the pattern. This will get rid of any wrinkle and folds in the paper. Carefully cut out each of the pieces at the correct size from the piece of pattern paper., Patterns contain various symbols. After cutting the pieces, familiarize yourself with the symbols printed on the pattern:   Single, heavy line: this is a cutting line. Double parallel lines: these lines are used to lengthen or shorten a garment. Triangles: triangular notches indicate where one piece will join with another piece. Dots: these empty or filled circles indicate where seams start and stop., Prior to cutting the pattern, you must properly prepare the fabric. Wash, dry, and iron the fabric. Fold your fabric as instructed in the pattern. Lay out your washed and ironed fabric on a flat surface—the wrong side of the fabric should face up unless specified otherwise.   Always double check to make sure your fabric is machine washable., Flip the instructions open to the cutting diagram for your garment. Place and pin the pieces onto the fabric as described and shown in the cutting diagram. Before cutting, make sure your pieces are properly aligned with the grainline of the fabric., Retrieve a pair of sewing scissors. Carefully cut out the pattern. Rotate the fabric as needed.	Locate the pattern number. Identify the sizes available in the pattern. Study the pictures and design variations. View the design drawings. Read the fabric suggestions. Read the notion and trim requirements. Study the body measurement and size chart. Asses the fabric requirements. Note the finished garment measurements. View the line drawings. Study the pattern pieces. Read the general sewing instructions. Study the cutting layout for your garment. Locate the pattern pieces required for your garment. Iron the pattern and cut out the size you need. Identify the symbols on the pattern pieces. Prep your fabric. Arrange the pieces on your fabric. Cut the pattern.

Set the Vacuform tray with the wick over the oil into the jar. Squeeze a layer of vegetable oil on top of the water. Finished.
Look at selections in your local gardening center, or in major retailers such as Home Depot, Lowe's or Sears.; , Photosynthesis requires red and blue light to regulate vegetative growth.  Position the lights on a solid, even surface above the plants you want to grow.   Follow any specific set up instructions that come with the model you buy. There should be information in the packaging or on the box.  Vegetable plants do best outdoors in direct sunlight, so create a similar environment with your grow lights.   Keep your vegetable plants no more than 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) away from the grow lights.    Turn the lights off for 6 to 10 hours every day. Vegetable plants do need a period of darkness to mature and trigger production.    Consider full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs.These bulbs will provide warm and cool (red and blue) light which mimics natural solar light. These lights are great to get seedlings started and will provide intense, direct light for your vegetable plants. Use high intensity discharge lamps for energy efficiency and extra intensity. These grow lights are used by commercial growers and emit twice the amount of light for the same amount of energy. They are also more expensive.  The light is more intense in the center of the bulb, so it will help your plants grow evenly.    Wipe off any dust or dirt that accumulates. Dirty bulbs do not give off as much light as they should. Replace fluorescent bulbs that begin to darken on the ends. This means the bulb is aging and not producing as much light as it should.  Pick them off the plant when they are ready to be eaten.    Wait until you have some foliage or flowering on your plants if you began growing them from seeds with grow lights.	Shop around for grow lights. Look for lights that will provide all the colors found in natural sunlight. Set up your grow lights the same way you would set up a lamp. Make sure the intensity of the light is strong. Give your vegetable plants at least 14 to 18 hours of direct light every day. Choose the right bulbs for your vegetable plants. Rotate your vegetable plants under the grow lights every week. Inspect the bulbs in your grow lights every 4 to 6 weeks. Harvest your vegetables the way you would with an outdoor garden. Transplant your vegetable plants to your outdoor garden when the conditions are good.
Your heels should make a "V" shape. Make sure to focus on rotating your hips out. However, if you have hyperextended legs you can open your ankles to a couple of centimeters apart if your knees touch. If you demi-plie in 1st, you should make sure you are not rolling forward over your feet. This will lead to severe injuries.; , Your arms should make a circle, and they should rest about 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from your body.   Tuck your thumbs in and keep your fingers and arms long.	Put your heels together and spread your toes apart. With your arms, pretend that you are holding a beach ball with your arms all the way around it.

Think of the room in which you want to place the chair. Is it a bedroom, family room or simply a hallway? If you are planning to place the chair in a hallway it is likely to be more of a decorative piece and remain untouched. On the other hand, if you are placing the chair in the family room, you want a piece that can take a lot of wear.For example, if you have children, pets, or friends with a penchant for destruction, you'll want a chair that's durable and practical. However, if you live alone and want to make a statement, maybe you'd prefer a chair that's more artistic than practical.; , An accent chair should make a room more inviting, not clutter it up unnecessarily and block movement. Plan out where you want the chair to go before purchasing. For example, if you are looking for some extra seating in a family room, consider adding a chair or two to face inwards and book-end a sofa. Or try placing an accent chair in a corner or next to window to create a reading nook.Knowing where you will place the chair can also help you decide on size and style in the future.  There are many factors that can affect the size of your accent chair. Not only do you need to think about the size of the room, but also the height and width of your other furniture and the people who use it. For example, your accent chair should sit at the same height as your sofa and other chairs.   You may also want a chair with more leg room for those who are tall.  Before choosing a fabric, it’s best to consider how the chair will be used and by whom. This will help you pick a fabric that works in the room rather than against it. For example, if you have children or pets, you may want to avoid materials like suede. While a classic for accent chairs, it’s easily stained and not very durable. Similarly, you may want to go with microfiber rather than leather. It will give you a similar look, but be far more kind to dirt and food residue.   You can also use the fabric of a chair to make it stand out from the rest of your furniture. For example, if you have mainly upholstered pieces, try a leather accent chair for a rugged contrast.  Think about the look and shape of the chair you want in the room. For example, do you want something with a sleek silhouette or is it important to have a bigger piece with arms? If you're looking for a classic chair style, choose a roomy club chair with extra deep seats or a large wingback chair that can help balance out a room with a bigger sofa. You can even go a completely different route with a slipper chair, which is armless and sits low to the ground., One of the easiest ways to decide on a color for an accent chair is to base it off other colors already in the room. To do this, try using complementary colors on the color wheel. For example, if you have a lot of blue in the room via lamps, rugs, or paintings, then try a burnt orange-colored accent chair. Or, if you have a large chartreuse or earthy green sofa, try a deep violet for your chair., Accent chairs are meant to bring a new design element to a room. They are also easy ways to make an eye-popping statement while still remaining practical. Go for a color you love, but wouldn't use normally. For example, bold jewel-tones like jade, ruby, and sapphire always stand out with neutral tones like black, gray, or navy.You can also pick large patterns like floral prints, geometric shapes, chevron stripes, or animal prints to bring the chair to the forefront., For a put-together look, try matching the accent chair to other items in the room, either through their colors or patterns. This can be anything from pillows, lamps, and pictures to knick-knacks. For example, if you have black and white striped accent pillows on your sofa, try getting a chair that mimics the pattern with black and white lines. The chair will still stand out against your other furniture, however, it will help keep symmetry in the room by matching smaller pieces.   Or if you have a favorite art piece, pull one or two colors from there and find an accent chair in the same shades.	Take into account the chair’s purpose. Decide on placement. Look at the size. Pick a suitable fabric. Pick a chair style. Go for complementary colors. Choose a statement color or pattern. Work with the room’s decor.
It is recommended to do your sketch with a hard pastel or a pastel pencil. Draw lightly. It is also recommended to use a pastel paper to do your painting on. Wallis paper is like a very fine sandpaper and the tooth of the paper holds the pastels. It gives you rich colors and the ability to manipulate and blend them.    It is recommended that you use hard pastels first. Save the soft pastels for the finishing touches. Like icing on a cake. Because of the tooth of Wallis paper and other papers like it, using the hard pastels first will be beneficial and will keep you from using up your expensive soft pastels too quickly. The more pastel you put in an area...the darker it will be. It is also recommended that you wear rubber gloves and do your blending with your gloved finger. This to keep from getting sore fingers if you are using Wallis paper or a paper like it. It's like trying to sand off your fingerprints. Ouch!	Sketch what you want to paint. Begin painting with the pastels.
Farming often produces a good amount of biodegradable waste in the form of decayed crops and grass, and many farmers use these materials to create and sell compost. Buying from organic farmers is the only way to guarantee a completely organic product, however, since compost from other farms will likely contain trace amounts of pesticide residue from grass clippings and leaves. These pesticides will like break down during decomposition, creating a mostly organic product, but the compost will not be 100 percent organic unless it comes from an organic farm.  Many municipalities sell compost and other farming materials, especially if those municipalities include agricultural regions. Contact your municipality or nearby municipalities to find out if they sell organic compost and how you can obtain it.  Compost is a common soil amendment, and most garden centers will carry some even if the store is small. As time passes, the interest in organic farming and gardening continues to grow, organic composts are found more easily at a range of garden supply stores. You can further increase your likelihood of success by going to an organic garden center, though, since organic garden centers specialize in carrying organic products.  You can find high quality, certified organic composts at big box or chain retailers, but your likelihood of running across low quality composts is increased at a big box store. Many of these products are poorly labeled and tightly sealed, making it difficult to check the content and quality prior to purchase. If you do purchase organic compost from a major store, make sure that you check the quality once you bring it home. Do not use it if it appears poorly made., If buying from a manufacturer, buying in bulk rather than by bag is generally more cost effective. Moreover, since you cannot check the quality in person before buying the compost, you should only buy from reliable manufacturers and you should also check the quality of the compost once it is delivered.	Contact organic farmers. Go to the municipality. Check out the supply at a garden center. Use caution when buying from a big box store. Order online or by phone from compost manufacturers.You can purchase organic compost directly from the manufacturer by locating the manufacturer’s contact information.
Hardiness zones are based on regional temperature averages. These colorful bands have a difference of about 10 degrees Fahrenheit from one to the next.   Each zone is further divided into subzone a or b, with the former being 5 degrees (Fahrenheit) cooler than the latter. One’s official zone indicates the lowest or highest possible temperature in their area during a normal year.; , Gardeners should check plant tags and purchase specimens that are considered suitable for their particular zone.   For example, a perennial that is classified as being for zones 8 to 10 would probably not survive the winter in zone 6. Likewise, gardeners in zone 11 would have a hard time getting the aforementioned plant through the summer.  The hardiness zone map is not a completely infallible resource but it is good as a general guide. Some of the faults with the map are outlined below:   Though efforts have been made to incorporate known microclimates into the updated map, the revised edition may not account for all of the nuances that are out there. The plant hardiness zones don't take into account extreme weather patterns, so gardeners who are experiencing unseasonably cold or warm periods may experience some plant loss as a result. Growers should keep in mind that some specimens that are said to grow in their zone may not necessarily thrive there. After all, there are many factors besides temperature which may account for a perennial’s overall success or failure.  The USDA has published a USDA Hardiness Zone Map which makes it easier to determine your exact zone. Go to the website and click on your state. A detailed map of the state that includes major cities will pop up to show you exactly which zone you live in.   To make this map, the USDA gathered average low winter temperature data for all areas throughout the United States and then grouped areas with similar temperatures together to form zones. Each individual zone is 10 degrees F warmer or cooler than the zones adjacent to it. For instance, USDA Hardiness Zone 5 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -20 and -10 degrees F. USDA Hardiness Zone 6 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -10 and 0 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees warmer than zone 5). And USDA Hardiness Zone 4 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -30 and -20 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees colder than zone 5). The zones are further subdivided into 5-degree Fahrenheit increments. USDA Hardiness Zone 5A winter lows are between -20 and -15 degrees Fahrenheit while zone 5B is -15 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit.  The range of average annual minimum winter temperatures for each zone on the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone map is as follows:Zone 0:   a: < −53.9 °C (−65 °F)  b: −53.9 °C (−65 °F) to −51.1 °C (−60 °F)    Zone 1:   a: −51.1 °C (−60 °F) to −48.3 °C (−55 °F)  b: −48.3 °C (−55 °F) to −45.6 °C (−50 °F)    Zone 2:   a: −45.6 °C (−50 °F) to −42.8 °C (−45 °F)  b: −42.8 °C (−45 °F) to −40 °C (−40 °F)    Zone 3:   a: −40 °C (−40 °F) to −37.2 °C (−35 °F)  b: −37.2 °C (−35 °F) to −34.4 °C (−30 °F)    Zone 4:   a: −34.4 °C (−30 °F) to −31.7 °C (−25 °F)  b: −31.7 °C (−25 °F) to −28.9 °C (−20 °F)    Zone 5:   a: −28.9 °C (−20 °F) to −26.1 °C (−15 °F)  b: −26.1 °C (−15 °F) to −23.3 °C (−10 °F)    Zone 6:   a: −23.3 °C (−10 °F) to −20.6 °C (−5 °F)  b: −20.6 °C (−5 °F) to −17.8 °C (0 °F)    Zone 7:   a: −17.8 °C (0 °F) to −15 °C (5 °F)  b: −15 °C (5 °F) to −12.2 °C (10 °F)    Zone 8:   a: −12.2 °C (10 °F) to −9.4 °C (15 °F)  b: −9.4 °C (15 °F) to −6.7 °C (20 °F)    Zone 9:   a: −6.7 °C (20 °F) to −3.9 °C (25 °F)  b: −3.9 °C (25 °F) to −1.1 °C (30 °F)    Zone 10:   a: −1.1 °C (30 °F) to +1.7 °C (35 °F)  b: +1.7 °C (35 °F) to +4.4 °C (40 °F)    Zone 11:   a: +4.4 °C (40 °F) to +7.2 °C (45 °F)  b: +7.2 °C (45 °F) to +10 °C (50 °F)    Zone 12:   a: +10 °C (50 °F) to +12.8 °C (55 °F)  b: > +12.8 °C (55 °F)    , While the average low temperature in the winter is a big factor in determining which plants will grow in your zone, the average high summer temperatures must also be considered.   Many plants cannot take the heat in hot southern climates. This high end of a plant’s temperature tolerance is actually taken into consideration when a plant is assigned a zone range. For instance, Japanese spirea (Spiraea japonica) is hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 8. This means it will only thrive in climates where winter temperatures drop to below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It will not grow well in the mild winters and hot summers of USDA Hardiness Zone 9 or higher.  Living in warmer climates in the west, south and along the coast can make finding your gardening zone a little more complicated. These areas are riddled with microclimates that are influenced by elevation. Temperatures within these microclimates are not the norm for the general area.   Fortunately, “Sunset Magazine” has gathered information about these microclimates to help gardeners purchase the right plants. Go to their “Plant Finder” page, click on “What is your Sunset Climate Zone?” and simply enter your zip code. Sunset climate zone tolerances are not often listed for plants purchased through the mail, though. So when you live in these warmer areas, it is better to go to a local nursery or garden center to purchase plants. They will be very familiar with these microclimates and can recommend the right plants for your gardening zone.  The best time to plant trees, shrubs and perennials depends to some extent on your USDA Hardiness Zone.   In Zones 9 through 1, where temperatures dip to below freezing during the winter, deciduous trees and shrubs should be planted right around the first killing frost in the fall. Evergreens and perennial plants should be planted right after the last hard frost in the spring. If evergreens are planted in the fall, they often sustain damage to the leaves due to drying winter winds and cold temperatures. The Farmer’s Almanac is a very helpful resource when trying to determine when the first and last frosts usually occur in your area. In USDA Hardiness Zones 10 and above where temperatures rarely drop below freezing, the best time to plant trees and shrubs is in late fall, winter or very early spring to give the plants time to get established before the heat of the summer. Perennials should be planted after the last frost in the spring.  Take the ever-fluctuating climate into consideration when selecting trees, shrubs and perennials. All areas throughout the United States experience unusual highs and lows from time to time.   Determine your Hardiness Zone then choose plants that are rated hardy for at least one Zone higher and one Zone lower to insure the plant will survive an unexpected extreme.	Understand what is meant by a plant hardiness zone. Check plant tags to find the recommended zone for planting. Recognize the issues with the plant hardiness scale. Use the USDA zone map to find your exact plant hardiness zone. Familiarize yourself with the temperature scale. Take a plant's heat tolerance into account. Consider whether you live within a microclimate. Know that planting times will vary according to your hardiness zone. Play it safe.
Places you can buy them are eBay or Home Depot. You could also simply pick the seeds out of a pumpkin.; , Fill it with compost or natural fertilizer. Using your fingers, dig a small hole into the compost/natural fertilizer.  Make sure they're not in too deep before covering the hole with the fertilizer once more.  However, make sure the soil doesn't get too wet. Otherwise, the seeds will die.  Then, transplant them into clay pots. However, be careful not to disturb the pumpkin roots - they might go into shock and die.  The tendrils of the pumpkin plants will then coil around the dowel rods. After a while, the pumpkins will produce blossoms, which is a sign that they will be ready soon.  Since your pumpkin plants are indoors and have no access to pollination by bees or other insects, you are in charge of pollinating blossoms so that your plants can produce pumpkins.   Learn how to identify female and male blossoms. Pumpkins produce both male and female blossoms on the same vine. Male blossoms are longer, thinner, and look like trumpets. They have a stamen (little stem with pollen on it) on the inside. Female blossoms are wider, shorter, and more open, like little bowls. They do not have stamens in them. Watch (and possibly collect) your male blossoms carefully. It is possible for the vine to produce male blossoms first. They might wilt before a female blossom develops. If they wilt, don't throw them away, but save them until a female blossom is open. Pollinate the female blossoms. This can be done in two different ways: if your male blossoms are still on the vine and alive, use a clean paintbrush (or baking brush/basting brush) to carefully pick up some pollen (yellow powder) off of the stamen (little stem in the inside middle of the blossom) of the male blossoms. Use your brush to gently touch the pollen to the base (inside) of the female blossom(s). If your male blossoms are wilted, open them up carefully and pull out the stamen (stem in the middle of the blossoms with the pollen on the end). Take the stamen and gently push it with the pollen end into the female blossom until it touches the bottom and some pollen comes off. You can just leave the stamen in there, if you want, or remove it afterward. , Cut off the pumpkin about two inches above the pumpkin's top.	Purchase pumpkin seeds. Find a plastic, disposable cup. Place three seeds about half an inch down. Water the pumpkin seeds every other day. Wait a few weeks until all the pumpkin seeds have sprouted. Next to the pumpkins in the clay plots, put in six foot dowel rods. Pollinate the blossoms. When fruit develops from the blossoms, make sure your plant gets enough light and water.  , Once the pumpkins have turned the mature color, they are ready to harvest.
Boston ferns will do best in a potting mixture of peat moss, sand, and garden soil. You can buy all of these at your local gardening store. Your final mixture should be even parts of each ingredient.The pot should be big enough for your fern to sit comfortably without it's roots being near the drainage holes, but without a lot of extra space that could accumulate "root rot.", Put your mixture and plant into the clean pot with drainage holes in the bottom.The fern can be planted about half of the way to the top of the pot so that the roots have space in the soil. Fill in the rest of the pot with more potting mixture, leaving about 1 inch( 25.4 mm) of space from the top., In many places, the summers are warm and humid enough to provide the perfect environment for a Boston fern. They do best in environments with humidity levels of at least 50 percent. If your daytime temperatures are between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and your nighttime temperatures are between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius), your Boston ferns will thrive outdoors.You can place them on your porch or patio, and they should do well.   The cooler temperatures at night will help to prevent fungus from developing.  If you are keeping your Boston fern indoors, whether permanently or just for the winter months, you will need to be careful about making sure it has adequate humidity. The very best thing to do is to place it in a room with a humidifier. Keep your house between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and put it in a cooler room at night.If you don’t want to invest in a humidifier, there are other options. You can place your fern in a saucer filled with small stones and water. The water will create humidity as it evaporates.  Boston ferns do best when receiving indirect, filtered sunlight. If they’re outdoors, place them somewhere where they will get sunlight through tree branches, or cracks in a porch roof. If they’re indoors, place them near a window. You don’t want your fern to be in shade, but you don’t want them to be in direct sunlight. It’s a delicate balance., Just like sunlight, you want to provide your Boston fern with enough water, but not too much. Water it with lukewarm water so that the soil is completely damp but not soaked. During warm weather months, you’ll need to water it more frequently. Make sure that the soil is never completely dry.In the wintertime, the fern is not in “growing season.” You can be less vigilant about watering it, and it's actually good to let the soil become dry to the touch before watering again. As new growth appears, start watering the fern more often so that the soil is continuously damp.  Boston ferns don’t require much, but it is helpful to feed them monthly during the warmer months. Purchase houseplant food at your local gardening supply store. Read the instructions on the packaging, and dilute it so that it is half as strong for your fern.   During the winter months, you can skip these feedings.  Fronds are the branch-like pieces that extend from the plant, covered in leaves. Older leaves may become discolored or lose their leaves, which isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing. Use sharp, clean scissors to remove the fronds all the way at the base. This will allow new, healthy fronds to grow.The best time to prune your Boston fern is in the spring or summer, during growing season.  Luckily, Boston ferns aren’t typically a target for insects, but they can occasionally attract bugs. Don’t use anything too harsh on your fern. Spray it with a mild insecticide or a natural insect repellant, and observe. Hopefully, this will be all you need to control any potential pests.	Gather your potting supplies. Pot your fern. Place your fern outdoors in a warm, humid environment. Put your Boston fern in an appropriate room indoors. Provide your fern with indirect sunlight. Keep the soil moist. Give your fern monthly feedings. Trim discolored or leafless fronds. Protect your fern from insects.
Pull the end of the thread through the needle so that the tail is a couple of inches long. Turn the hand wheel toward you until the needle is no longer visible and goes into the bobbin case.  Move the hand wheel slowly until the needle reaches its high point again. Continue to hold the thread that came through the needle during this process. When the needle comes up, the bobbin thread loop will also rise.  Pull the thread toward you until the loop is brought further out of the bobbin case. Pull both of the pieces of thread until they are under the presser foot. Drape the tail of the thread to the back and the right of the sewing machine.	Lower the needle. Raise the needle. Arrange the thread.
For a sustained, powerful aroma, make a custom candle. Choose a mason jar or other fire safe container. Go to a craft supplies store for some smokeless candle wicks and flaked soy wax, and make sure your kitchen is stocked with a tablespoon of vanilla extract, another of cinnamon, and ½ a tablespoon of ground clove.Use a microwave and start melting your wax by heating one cup on high for two minutes. Once the first cup is melted, add a bit of wax in one minute increments until you have sufficient melted wax for the container that will hold your candle. If you’re using a standard mason jar, you’ll need two cups of wax overall. Once the wax is melted, add the vanilla and spices. Mix well, ideally by stirring with a disposable skewer. Wrap the end of a candle wick that will be exposed around a thin item that can bridge the opening of your candle’s container. Allow the metal-tipped end to dangle to the bottom of the container. Pour the melted wax into the candle container while adjusting the wick to keep it in the center of the wax. Allow the candle to sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours to set.  You can make a spray that can instantly fill a room with the fall scent of your choosing. For an especially woodsy option, start with 3 tablespoons of either vodka, ethyl alcohol, or witch hazel. Add 10 drops each of the following oils; juniper, sage, bergamot, and cinnamon. Add these ingredients to an 8-ounce spray bottle and fill the bottle the rest of the way with water.   Always shake the bottle well before using. For a similar option, but sweeter-smelling option, go with 10 drops each of cedar wood, rosemary, orange, and clove oils instead. Avoid spraying your aromatic mist on anyone’s skin, or in front of anyone’s face.  If you have an essential oil diffuser, there are several great blends you can make to produce fall aromas. For example, use 3 drops of cardamom and 1 drop each of clove, cassia, and ginger essential oils to make a spiced Chai-inspired scent. For a more cool-walk-in-the-woods approach, use 3 drops of eucalyptus, 2 drops of juniper berry, and a single drop of sage essential oil.To get the scent of apple pie emanating from your diffuser, add 2 drops each of clove, ginger, and cinnamon bark oils. Add a drop of nutmeg too, for an even sweeter aroma. While classic cone or stick incense can provide fall-inspired aromas as well, essential oils are safer, healthier, and will better disperse aroma in your home.	Make your own fall-scented candles. Make an essential oil spray. Mix a fall-scented blend for your diffuser.
Fill the bowl with warm water until it is nearly full and rest the tuber on the surface of the water. The tuber should float. Place the bowl near a warm window and change the water every three to seven days.   Do not expose the tuber to direct sunlight or freezing temperatures. Plant the lotus within a few weeks after the tuber sprouts.  The right size container will depend on the type of lotus you chose. Bowl lotuses are very small and can fit comfortably inside a 2-gallon (7.57-liter) container, but a large lotus may need a 50-gallon (189.27-liter) container.   Make sure that your container does not have holes. Your lotus may begin growing out of the holes, creating a mess and causing it to perform poorly.  The best dirt is about 60 percent clay and 40 percent river sand, but most dense soils will work sufficiently well. Leave about 1 to 4 in. (2.54 to 10.16 cm) of empty space in between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.  For now, the surface level of the water should only be about as high as the pot, if not a little higher.  Place it in a horizontal position with the back part next to the wall of the container and the growing point toward the center. The growing points should stick straight up.   Gently press the tuber into the soil just enough to anchor it, but do not bury it too deep. The surface of the water should only be slightly higher than the top of the growing tip.  Your plant will be ready for deeper water once the growing tips show leaves. Smaller types of lotus only need 1 to 6 in. (2.54 to 15.24 cm) of water covering the top of the soil, but larger varieties may need up to 3 feet (0.9 m). (1 m) of water.  If you do not weigh the tuber down, it will float to the surface of the water.	Float the tuber in a large bowl. Select the right container. Fill your container with dirt. Place the pot in a shallow pond or tank. Set the tuber on top of the soil. After a few days, place the pot into your pond. Place a rock on top of the tuber to weigh it down.
Hold the coin by its edges: touching the surface directly can leave small scratches in the surface. If you want to protect the coin’s surface, don't rub it.  The higher your water pressure, the better. Make sure to not use a high-powered water jet that could go straight through the coin.  If dirt remains, lightly scrub the coin with a soft toothbrush and dish soap. Run the toothbrush under warm water to further soften the bristles. Rinse the brush and the coin frequently to avoid scratching the coin with the loosened dirt. Do not apply much pressure, and focus on brushing only the soiled area of the coin.   Toothbrush bristles come with varying degrees of firmness — you want one labeled as soft or extra-soft. If you use a firm bristle, you risk damaging the coin.  Especially on ancient coins, there may be dirt that remains after soaking and brushing. To remove this, use a small, sharp implement such as a toothpick or a precision screwdriver. Carefully pry and chip off the encrusted dirt, and try not to scratch the surface of the coin. You can spot-clean more precisely if you work under good lighting and use a microscope or magnifying glass.  Wait about ten minutes, then rub the vinegar off with a toothbrush. This may give the coin a more polished finish. Consider using anything acidic: lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and even sodas have been said to help clean rust off of old coins.   Consider adding salt to your vinegar/citric acid/soda. The combination of acid and chloride may make your cleaning solution even more powerful.  After soaking, thoroughly rinse the coin under very warm, running water. If the coin is clean enough for your taste, proceed to drying. Don't leave the acid on the coin, or it will keep etching and produce an unsightly green coating of copper salts.  Pat the coin dry with a soft, lint-free cloth, and then lay the coin on a soft, dry cloth to finish drying. Do not rub the coin dry.	Wash the coin under cold running water. Run the water over the coin for about a minute. Lightly brush the coin. Spot-clean encrusted dirt. Pour some vinegar over the coin. Rinse the coin again. Dry the coin.
The filter will attach to the pipes beneath the sink, so clear enough space to accommodate the filter system.; , Before you choose a filter, you will need to know what kind of impurities are present in your natural water supply.   Buy a do-it-yourself water testing kit to determine what you want to filter out of your water. Ask the water company for details on your water composition. If you use city or public water, they are required to disclose the makeup of the water you are drinking.  Each under-the-sink system will specialize in certain contaminants.   Review different models and talk to sales associates about what will work best for your water.  Under-the-sink filters should be able to make your water appealing to drink as well as safe.  Under-the-sink water filters use one of these methods to remove pollutants in your water.   Choose an activated carbon system if you want to use a replaceable cartridge. This type of system will capture chemicals, pesticides and other chemicals by using carbon in the filter.  This system will remove larger particles from your water and flush them as waste. The water pressure will be higher, and excess water is stored in a tank under the sink.  Many under-the-sink models include an attachment for the faucet which will allow you to get purified water for drinking, which uses the filter, and then regular tap water when you are cleaning or washing dishes.  You can pay between $100 and $300 for an under-the-sink water filter.  Major chains such as Lowe's and Home Improvement carry them, and you can also check with your local hardware store.  Specific brands sell them on their websites, and you can also find them on sites such as eBay, Amazon, Overstock and other online retailers.  Installation of your under-the-sink water filter can be timely. Some companies will install the filter for you.   Use a professional if you are planning to utilize a warranty. Many warranties will require you to have your filter professionally installed.  Most under-the-sink filters are easily maintained. You will want to find out how often to change the filter and what to do if it breaks or malfunctions.	Make sure you have room under your sink for a filter. Understand your water composition. Shop for a filter that will remove the pollutants present in your water. Choose a filter that can remove odors as well. Decide between activated carbon or reverse osmosis. Choose reverse osmosis if you want something more complex. Consider a filter that comes with a faucet attachment. Consider your budget. Look for filters in home improvement stores. Shop online for a larger selection and potential price deals. Consider professional installation. Ask a sales associate about maintenance.
To be successful on this project (where failure could, one might assume, leave you dead) requires a thorough survey of the site you choose. Here are some explanations why this is critical to success.  Bomb shelters must be able to sustain minimal damage in a near miss or direct hit from exploding ordinance.  Soft soil can offer only limited resistance to bomb energy, so building in soft soil requires a deep excavation with highly reinforced construction. In areas with poor drainage or a high water table, the option of building deep will require more engineering than this page will offer. Building in solid rock, unless you have a suitable cavern to use as a superstructure, will require blasting and drilling, which also will exceed the scope of this page. Building into the side of a mountain or steep hill is a good choice for people with the resources to do so, and without the depth requirements, the following steps are fairly typical of what needs to be done to successfully complete your bomb shelter project. Building on stable, flat, well-drained land is the most direct approach to getting the job done, and that will be what we assume the reader plans to do.; , Basically, there are four things to keep in mind while designing your shelter.  How many people will it house? This will give you information needed to design the shelter in respect to size and accommodation. Since bomb shelters typical are very temporary in nature unless a sustained bombardment is anticipated, you can expect to allow at least 72 square feet of space per person. Decide what ordinance your structure will need to resist. A typical 500 pound bomb has a blast energy of about 10,000 feet per second using high explosives, and if fused for a ground burst or impact detonation, you will want a minimum of 15 feet of energy absorbing material between the ground and your structural roof.  Bunker busters, on the other hand, can penetrate many feet (the exact distance, for obvious reasons, is classified), of reinforced concrete.  Since 20 feet is a reasonable limit to excavate and redress, we will assume our design on that depth, other considerations are best left to experts.   With an excavation this deep, shoring, sheet pilings, and other issues will require professional assistance, so the following construction steps are general requirements for minimal performance., If you are knowledgeable about concrete construction methods including load bearing cast in place concrete beams, roofs, and walls, you could do this yourself, however getting an expert is recommended, Most likely, you will need engineered plans and a geotechnical report before a permit will be issued.  Now that the technical issues have been addressed, look further down for actual building instructions.,,  For a 12X18 foot shelter, you will want to clear about one acre of land for ancillary use., Trying to dig a very deep hole on unlevel land is an invitation to disaster., This is to allow an access ramp to be created, and will give workment/equipment access in later steps. Continue to build your ramp until you are below the finish floor grade of your shelter., You may use a load for this purpose, but a large excavator, in the 300 to 350 range and with an extended reach boom will give faster and more efficient production., Working in the bottom of a deep pit without cave in protection is illegal and foolish. When unstable soil is encountered, either use shoring systems or sheet piling to protect the workers., You may now want to rough in whatever utilities your shelter will require, such as electrical power, plumbing, and a fresh air supply duct, since these may be installed underneath your shelter foundation.,  Since the main structural element of the shelter will be the walls and especially the roof, you will not need an very thick floor, but the exterior walls will require a substantial foundation. This can be placed in a monolithic slab, making the floor itself about 8 inches thick, and the wall foundations about 3 feet thick and 5 feet wide., Number 5 rebar on 8 inch centers, the wall footings will need something like 8 number 8 rebar, 4 top and bottom supported by number 4 rebar stirrups on 24 inch centers. You will also want to provide 2 rows of dowels made from number 8 rebar on 12 inch centers spaced 10 inches apart. These will require a minimum of 30 inches embedment and 6 feet of projection. Keep in mind these are general design requirements, if your structural engineer requires more or different configurations, he is the expert., Your bomb shelter should be protected by a blast resistant, reinforced concrete and steel laminated structural door and frame. Consulting a vault door manufacturer like Mosler is probably a good idea., You will almost certainly require an aerial concrete pump for this part of the project, choose one with sufficient boom and capacity to reach all sides of the slab without getting too near the excavation. These special vehicles can have booms from 30 to 40 meters long, and a pump hose 6 inches in diameter., You may use coil rods, snap ties, or other means to secure the forms, along with whalers, stiff backs, and other shoring to keep your walls plumb and uniform in thickness. You will want to go ahead and erect the inside forms to the finished ceiling height of the bomb shelter. Generally, a minimum of 7 foot is required, but 8 foot ceilings are considered standard., The sides will be reinforced with number 8 rebar on twelve inch centers vertically (two rows), and number 6 rebar horizontal at 12 inch maximum centers on each row of vertical bars. Make sure to use corner bar reinforcement at all corners, and lap bars at splices a minimum of 48 bar diameters.,, The tensile strength of the concrete is up to you or a structural engineer, but 4000 psi concrete is recommended. The exterior forms should extend higher than the interior ceiling so they will act as a perimeter form for placing the concrete roof on your bunker.  Depending on the blast energy calculation you made earlier, decide on the thickness of the bunker roof.  Since it will support the weight of tons of earth as well as resisting the bomb blast, a minimum thickness of 2 feet is suggested., A minimum to two mats of number 8 rebar at 10 inches on center is needed, for roof spans greater than 16 feet, increase the rebar size, decrease the spacing, and thicken the roof unless steel support beams and columns are used to offset the increase load. You may also consider pouring lateral concrete support beams (and even using high tensile pre-stressed concrete slabs for the roof, if it is in your budget)., Make sure the concrete is slumped correctly and that you vibrate it to consolidate the materials while pouring. Using the services of a testing laboratory will help ensure the concrete reaches its required strength., You will want to leave the outside forms in place until the roof has been cast in place., You may choose to rent metal shoring systems from a form company, but you will need to install a minimum of one 4X4 tee jack at 32 inch cents both ways with the top of the tee 1 inch below the form joist bottoms. Assuming you are using 2X6 pine joists for your form, and the ceiling is 8 feet high, your tee jacks will be 7 feet 5 inches tall.  Install diagonal bracing to keep your tee jacks plumb and in line. For the uninitiated, a tee jack is a vertical post built from a 4X4 with a horizontal Tee on top, also usually a 4X4., After your tee jacks are in place, lay out your joists on 12 to 16 inch centers, then deck the joists with either form panel metal sheeting (preferred) or a minimum 3/4 form ply sheeting., You will have two or three mats of rebar, minimum, so tie your first mat of number 8 rebar on ten inch centers supporting it on rebar chairs sold for this purpose, the support and tie of the second mat using standees to maintain the correct spacing between mats., As with the walls, higher strength concrete is required, with a minimum yield of 4000 psi, but a preferred design mix of 5000 psi or 850 flexural strength. Allow this concrete placement to cure for a minimum of 7 days before removing the shoring support system. After 28 days, the outside forms can be removed, and backfilling can commence., If you have installed an air supply duct underneath the slab, you can backfill to the top, otherwise, you will want to install this duct work when you reach the elevation required., Do not backfill the access ramp yet, as you will need to construct a tunnel entrance to allow access first., You will need to create a tunnel at least 50 feet long to reach the door of your bomb shelter. Depending on the size of your door, using a concrete pipe or structural tubing like asphalt coated galvanized steel pipe in 10 or 12 feet diameter is the most practical method. Since tunnel failure can turn your refuge into a tomb in short order, care in choosing and constructing your entrance venue is just as important as designing and building the shelter itself., Restore the vegetation over the top, connect the utilities and air supply ducts, and you are finished.	Develop a site plan for the location you plan on building your bomb shelter at. Determine the critical factors to consider in your design. Hire a geotechnical firm to address drainage, soil density, excavation shoring requirements, and other factors to ensure safe digging and building conditions. Hire a structural engineer for detailed construction plans. Talk with your local planning and zoning office to determine what permits and licenses your project will require.Mark out your site, erect silt fences, erosion barriers, and other controls needed to begin clearing and excavation. Clear sufficient land for your excavation, spoil piles, and haul/storage areas. Grade the excavation area to a reasonably flat profile. Start digging your excavation about 150 feet from your actual shelter's footprint. Dig the bottom of the shelter pit about 4 feet wider than the outside wall dimensions. Inspect the sides of the excavation often, especially if you enter a different soil layer, to make sure they are stable. Dig until you reach the excavation requirements, grade the bottom of your pit, and compact the soil. Form up the foundation for your bomb shelter. Install the footing and slab reinforcement. Allow an opening on the end of the slab where your ramp enters your pit for a door. Place your concrete foundation and slab. Build or rent forms for your wall concrete placement. Install and tie the reinforcing bars for your walls.Build beam pockets if your ceiling/roof span requires structural steel support beams (refer to engineer's recommendations) to allow these beams to be installed prior to building the roof. Set the exterior forms, shore and align them, and place the concrete for these. Dowel out rebar for the shelter roof from the wall forms. Pour your concrete walls using the same pump you hired for the floor pour. Allow the concrete walls to set/cure a minimum of 7 days before removing the forms. Set up shoring for the roof forms. Finish fabricating and installing all of your tee jacks. Install your rebar reinforcing on top of the platform you have built to act as your ceiling form. Place the bomb shelter roof with concrete. Backfill around the wall perimeter in lifts, using compaction equipment to ensure the soil is compacted in 8 to 12 inch lifts. Backfill the excavation over the roof of the shelter carefully, and avoid using heavy equipment directly over the top of it, especially until the first four or five feet of fill has been installed and compacted. Construct an entrance to your bomb shelter. Finish constructing your entrance tunnel and backfilling the excavation.
This scale is a great way to throw some melodic variation into your lines, and fits neatly over funk, blues, rock, and pop chord progressions. It has a slightly moody, bluesy feel. As always, find the one and three and make them shine, often using the root note. The following is the A-minor pentatonic scale. The note in parenthesis is a grace note, used for a bluesy feel, that can be left out if you want: G|----------5-7-(8)-| D|-----------5---7-| A|-----5-(6)-7-------| E|-5-8-------------|  , The major pentatonic offers the variation loved in pentatonic, but it has a happier feel. It's not quite as bright as the major scale, but it's still a good mood kind of scale and is used accordingly. The following is for the A-major pentatonic scale: G|-----------4---6-| D|-----------4---7-| A|-----4---7-| E|-5-7-------------|, Start the scale on the root note and play from there, using the scale to help your find notes for your licks. The following scale is for A Major, since it starts on the fifth fret (an A): G|-----------------| D|-----------4-6-7-| A|-----4-5-7-------| E|-5-7-------------|, Not used a tone in funk, but still easily modified for funk, this note will give you a bit of a darker, more intense feel for songs that call for it. When played straight, it may sound a little too sad, but that focus on rhythm will give it the pulsing feel that makes it funk. This is for A minor: G|-----------------| D|-------------5-7-| A|-------5-7-----| E|-5-7-8-----------|	Learn the minor pentatonic scale. Learn the major pentatonic scale for a more upbeat feel. Play a major scale for warm, happy tones. Play the minor scale for a darker, sadder tone.
Most living rooms contain a sofa, armchair, side table, and coffee table. Look for these basic elements before adding extra pieces such as ottomans and additional tables.  Look for solid furniture with sturdy wood frames and sinuous steel springs. High-quality pieces may cost a little more, but they tend to hold up better and last longer.  Luxurious, high-quality materials will keep you feeling more comfortable and tend to last longer than cheaper fabrics. Stain-resistant fabrics are especially useful if you have young children, but they might still be a good idea even if you only plan on using the space for guests since spills and stains can happen to anyone.  Foam is comfortable and durable. Some cushions may be filled with down, but down usually breaks and wears quickly.  Lift one leg of the piece about six inches (15 centimeters) off the floor. If the adjacent leg has not risen as well, the frame is too flexible and too flimsy.  Each piece of furniture in your living room should complement the others. Otherwise, your room will look chaotic and thrown together. If you have an interior design theme, such as modern or traditional, stick with pieces that fit with your theme.  There are a number of ways to divide up interior design themes, but the main ones often include modern, contemporary, traditional, casual, and Old World.   Modern and contemporary furniture has sleek, clean lines and usually makes use of white, beige, or other neutral colors. Glass, metal, and shiny black lacquer are used more often than traditional woods. Traditional furniture is elegant. It tends to look a little more formal and may include details like rolled arms and skirted bottoms. Colors range from ivory to rich hues of red and other colors. Casual furniture is friendly and cozy. Many pieces make use of plaid, small prints, and other patterns. Old World furniture combines styles from French, Spanish, and Italian designs. Rustic, antique pieces are especially appropriate, and you should look for deep, earthy colors.  Loveseats typically provide seating for two individuals. If you have a small family or only intend to use the space for entertaining an occasional guest, a loveseat could save you space while providing you with as much as you need.  Chests, flat-top ottomans, and extra tables or seating can add a lot to a large living room, but too many of these pieces will crowd out a smaller space.	Start with the basics. Buy investment pieces. Look for high-quality, stain-resistant fabrics. Look for cushions made of wrapped foam. Test the strength of the frame. Coordinate your pieces. Know your themes. Opt for a loveseat instead of a sofa if you have a smaller space. Fill the room in with additional pieces as space allows.
Create one mound for each rhizome you will be planting. The mounds should be spaced about 3 feet (0.9 m) apart, so the hops have plenty of room to grow.  Dig a 4-inch hole in each mound. Plant the rhizomes horizontally, with the root side down. Mound soil over the rhizomes and loosely pack it down, then cover with straw or a light mulch to inhibit weed growth. Keep the soil consistently moist until the hops begin to sprout.  When the hops emerge and grow about 6 inches (15.2 cm), they need to be "trained" around the trellis you are using to help them grow vertically. Place the trellis near the plants and gently wrap them around its base.   Continue training the hops for a few days. After awhile, they'll begin growing clockwise around the trellis on their own. If some of the shoots that sprout look damaged or weak, remove them, rather than allowing them to take up space on the trellis. Each rhizome should produce between 4 and 6 healthy vines.  After a few months of growth, trim the leaves off the bottom 4 feet (1.2 m) of the bines. This prevents the plants from getting damaged by diseases or fungus that may be present in the soil.  As the vines begin to grow tall and strong, keep the soil around them weeded. Water the hops every day so that the soil stays moist, but not drenched. Continue caring for the hops in this way until late summer, when it's time to harvest them.	Mound the soil. Plant the hops. Train the bines. Trim the bines. Care for the plants.
To make a pyramid, you need to start with paper that has equal dimensions in the length and width. The thicker the paper, the more durable the pyramid, but if you go too thick, the pyramid will be difficult to fold. Good paper choices include:   Origami paper Construction paper Cardstock; , First, fold and unfold it diagonally through the center from top right to bottom left, and then diagonally through the center from the top left to bottom right., Look at the folds you’ve made (the paper will be folded into four triangles). Either with a pencil or in your mind, label the four folds that divide the paper into quarters as A, B, C, and D (in order, going counter-clockwise).  You want the paper in front of you so that the triangle labeled side D and A has its bottom edge facing you.  Start by folding the left side of the triangle in half in on itself, so the outer edges of sides C and D meet. Repeat on the other side, so that the outer edges of sides A and B meet., Start on one side, and fold the bottom corners in toward the center, so that each bottom corner comes to meet the top corner. Repeat on the other side.  Orient the square so it looks like a diamond, with all the folded flaps at the top and the neat bottom point facing you. On each side of the paper, fold the two side points of the diamond in to the center so the bottom edge of the diamond lines up with the center edge of the square.  On each of the four kite faces, open each fold one at a time until you get a small right triangle sticking out the back of your fold. Fold this little triangle down over the front, and then refold all the original folds. Repeat with each kite face.  Fold it back and forth to create a nice crease.Now, stand the kite up on the bottom tip, and gently press the center tip at the top. The paper should begin opening up and unfolding at the base at the last crease you made. Once it unfolds into a triangle, you can square off the edges of the base and the sides of your paper pyramid. , Either use a square piece of paper to create your own template, or print one off and use it as either the paper for the pyramid or a cut-out template that you can trace onto a different piece of paper.   A proper pyramid template pattern will have a square base, and off each side of that base there will be an attached triangle. Two or all four of these triangles will have tabs on them. Once cut out, the four triangles will come together and join at the top to form the pyramid faces.  The tabs on the side are important (so don’t cut them off) because these will be used to glue or tape the sides of the pyramid together.  Now that the pattern has been cut, you have the basic shape for your pyramid, and it can now be decorated any way you like. Remember that the faces on the underside of the paper will become the outside, so be sure to decorate the right side!   Try drawing an overlapping grid pattern to make it look like the bricks of an Egyptian pyramid.  After decorating, flip the pyramid back over to create creases so that the faces will come together nicely. Make sure to direct the creases inward, and don’t forget to crease the tabs as well. ]   If you are using thicker paper, such as cardboard, consider using a hobby knife or scissors to gently trace the lines where the pyramid will bend and fold.  Apply glue or tape to the outside edges (the decorated side edges) of all the tabs. Bring the four faces of the pyramid together, securing them to each other by positioning the sticky tabs on the inside of the pyramid faces.Gently press the sides to the tabs and allow the glue to dry.	Find a square piece of paper. Fold and unfold the paper. Lay the paper flat on a table. Orient the paper. Fold the paper into a smaller triangle. Fold the triangle into a square. Fold the square into a kite. Anchor the folds. Fold down the tip of the kite. Finished!  , Print or draw a pyramid template. Cut out your pyramid pattern. Flip the paper over and decorate. Crease all the pyramid edges. Form the pyramid.
Use the remote or close the door manually. This will allow you to access the tracks and the rest of the moving parts on your door.  Before lubricating your door, you'll want to make sure that it's not on. Disconnect your garage door from the power source, after you close it., The tracks are the what the garage door rollers ride on to open and close. You don't want to lubricate these, but you do want to make sure that they are completely cleaned out for your door to operate correctly. Wipe down the inside of both tracks and remove any dirt and debris.Make sure that there are no debris left in your tracks that the rollers can get stuck on.  If you are having issues getting debris out of the tracks, you can use a vacuum with a hose extension to suck out the dirt and debris. This is a great solution to reach the higher portion of the tracks that you may be having issues reaching., Popular standard degreasers like WD-40 isn't the best option for a garage door. Instead, purchase a lithium based grease at a hardware store or online. There are also certain greases that are made specifically for garage doors. Do not use oil.Garage door grease will typically come in an aerosol or spray can. Oil is susceptible to dirt and dust buildup and is more likely to drip than garage door grease or lube. Read the label to make sure that the grease that you are using is appropriate for your doors.  Slowly lift your garage door up manually and spray down the hinges as it meets the bend of the track. This will lubricate the moving parts on the door and will make opening and closing the garage door much smoother. Use one or two sprays on each hinge. Your hinges should be covered in lubricant., The rollers are the circular moving pieces on your garage door and are attached to each of your hinges. Inside of these rollers are small ball bearings that need to be lubricated for your door to open and close smoothly. Use the thin hose attachment to spray the grease inside of the rollers.Any exposed ball bearings must be thoroughly lubricated.  The springs can usually be found at the top of the garage door and must be fully lubricated as well. The bearing plates are the moving circular parts on both sides of the springs. Spray down the outside of the springs and near the center of the bearing plates, then open and close your garage door to spread the grease around.You will most likely need a step ladder to reach the springs and bearing plates. If your springs are making noises, you need to grease your springs.  Lubricating the lock will make locking your garage door easier, and can prevent rust in the long run. Point the lubricant towards the lock's keyhole and spray it once to lubricate it. Once you're done lubricating the lock, finish lubricating your garage door by spraying the grease on the large armbar at the top of your door., The rail is the portion that your chain rides on and should run along your garage's ceiling. The top portion of the rail is what your chain actually rides along, so it's the part that needs to be lubricated. Spray down the top of the rail and then spread the grease around with a rag.The chain comes with a natural protectant on it that makes it so that you don't have to grease it regularly. Spraying the bottom of the rail doesn't do anything.	Close the garage door. Cut power to the door. Clean out the tracks with a damp rag. Vacuum out dirt and dust from your tracks. Purchase a lithium based grease or garage door lube. Open your door and spray the lubricant on each of the hinges. Lubricate the rollers. Spray the outside of your springs and bearing plates. Spray the lock and armbar. Lubricate the top of the rail.
Use a half-gallon (2 L) mixing container and combine both of the liquid ingredients together. Stir vigorously, but don't create air bubbles.   If you need more glycerin solution, use a ratio of 1:2 glycerin to warm water and adjust the rest of the ingredients accordingly., These ingredients will make up your dye mixture and will be added to the glycerin and water mixture after. Pour 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of hot water, 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of floral dye, and 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of citric acid in a separate bowl. Stir continuously until the mixture is dissolved. Once you've mixed them together, combine them to your half-gallon (2 L) mixing container and continue to both liquid solutions together until they are well incorporated.The dye will help the plant to retain its natural color. If you don't use dye your boxwood cuttings will turn a golden hue.  You can pack as many boxwood cuttings into a single container that you want, as long as you have enough glycerin solution. For every ounce (28 g) of cuttings add 1 fluid ounce (0.125 cup) of glycerin solution in the container. Weigh your boxwood cuttings on a scale so that you know how much of the solution has to go into each container.   Using the correct amount of solution will ensure that the cuttings will be flexible and won't run out of solution to absorb.  Get the container that you set aside previously for your boxwood cuttings and pour the glycerin solution into the container. Use a measuring cup to make sure that you're pouring the right amount of solution into the container.   For instance, if you had 10 ounces (280 g) of boxwood cuttings, you'd need 10 fluid ounces (1.25 cups) of the solution.	Mix 2 cups (16 oz) of warm water with 1 cup (8 oz) of glycerin. Mix floral dye, citric acid, and 1/2 cup (4 oz) of hot water together. Weigh the boxwood cuttings. Pour the proper amount of solution into your container.
While just about any type of herb will do well in a container, not all vegetables will. You can buy mature plants from a nursery or you can start them from seeds. Here are the types of herbs and vegetables that do well in container gardens:Herbs, such as basil, mint, and thyme. You can even plant a bunch in a large planter for a mini garden. All salad greens, such as collards, lettuce, mustard, and Swiss chard. Harvest only the outer layers. Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers all do well in summer pots, but will need supports or cages. Cucumbers, zucchini, and other types of squash will also work. Cucumbers can also climb a trellis to save space.; , This is important, otherwise the soil will become waterlogged and lead to root rot, which can kill your plant. Your planter can be made out of anything: wood, plastic, clay, etc. Keep in mind, however, that wood planters don't last for more than a few seasons. Also, if you live in a hot, dry climate, stay away from terracotta; they dry out too quickly and soak up too much moisture.   If you absolutely must have a terracotta planter, get one that is sealed on the inside.  Short, wide pots are good for shallow-rooted, plants such as lettuce, while large, tall pots are good for vegetables, such as a zucchini or pumpkin. Half-size wine barrels also make great containers.A 10-inch (25.4 centimeters) pot is best for herbs and small plants, like strawberries and lettuce. A 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) pot is great for herbs and salad greens, like spinach, non-heading lettuce, and arugula plants. An 18-inch (45.72 centimeters) pot is good for small vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, and small peppers. It can also hold salad greens and herbs in small bunches. A 24-inch (60.96 centimeters) pot is best for large vegetables, such as cucumber, squash, and tomatoes. It can also hold small bunches of small vegetables and herbs.  This will prevent the soil from falling out while allowing the water to pass through. You can use a scrap of burlap, window screening, or even a coffee filter.   You will also want to place a dish under the planter to catch any excess water and keep your floor or patio clean.  Different plants will have different needs; some plants need a well-draining soil while others need a water-retaining soil. In general, however, you should look for soil that is light, fluffy, and holds moisture well.Consider looking for ingredients, such as: aged bark, lime, perlite, sphagnum peat moss, and vermiculite. They will make the soil more expensive, but they will ensure the healthiest crops.Added wetting agents will help the soil stay evenly damp. Fertilizers are great additions, but you will need to add more fertilizer later on; it doesn't last forever! If you have thirsty plants, such as vegetables, consider getting a specially-formulated soil that retains water., Make sure to have some extra soil on hand, as the soil will compress a little once you water it. Do not pack or press down on the soil, however. Instead, gently tap the pot against the ground, or rock it side-to-side, to collapse any air pockets., Carefully take your plant out of the container it came in, and make a hole in the soil large enough to hold the plant's root ball. Place the plant into the hole, and gently pat the soil around it.   If you are starting your garden from seeds, then sow the seeds according to the directions on the seed packet. At this point, you can also add cage or supports, if needed.  The soil will compress 15 to 20%, so you will have to add more soil on top and water again.Keep doing this until the soil level is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim of the pot.   Add some liquid plant food to the water for a nutritional boost., Water them when the top inch (2.54 centimeters) of soil is dry. If you find that the soil is drying out too fast, add some mulching on top, such as fine bark or straw. If you live in a humid climate, use white pebbles instead; hey will dry out faster and prevent root rot.Fertilize only when necessary, and be sure to use the right type of fertilizer for your herb or vegetable. Each plant will have different requirements. Make sure that your plants are getting around 5 hours of direct sunlight each day. Some plants, such as cabbage, can live in shaded areas. Others, such as cucumbers, thrive in full sun.	Buy the right herbs or vegetables to plant in your container garden. Choose a planter with drainage holes at the bottom. Make sure that the planter is the right shape and size for your plant. Cover the drainage hole with a porous material. Choose a good soil suitable for the type of plant you are growing. Fill the pot with soil 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim. Add your plants, and fill the spaces with more soil. Water the soil until water starts to leak out of the bottom of the pot. Take care of your herbs or vegetables.
Winter weather will find the overlooked weakness if your preparation is incomplete.  Coolant systems that are not in the right proportion will lead to overheating due to freezing. Have the car's coolant system flushed in the fall before the first freeze. You also need to check the system for leaks and install fresh coolant.  Protect your paint job, guard against ice on the windshield (see tips), and guard against the fluids and/or water in your radiator from freezing. And, yes, there is such a thing as “gas line freeze”. Condensation builds up in the gas line and gas tank, and freezes. (You may want to inquire with an auto parts store about a head bolt heater.)   If you do not have shelter for your car, invest in a car cover. Try to find one that is reversible – with one side a very bright color such as orange, yellow and in neon shades. A car cover will not save you from freezing fluids, but it will keep snow and ice off the windshield and your paint, and help protect your car from salts that might be used on the streets in your community. , Change the windshield wiper fluid with one that has antifreeze added to it.  The cold weather puts unusual demands on the charging system.    An older car in an area that has temperatures that fall below freezing often uses 30-weight single viscosity oil. You need to go to a lower viscosity oil, like a 10-weight, when the temperature falls below zero and stays there. This also applies to your automatic transmission fluid. Higher weight oils and transmission fluids do not lubricate sufficiently in colder weather. Newer automobiles use multi-viscosity oil such as 10 and 30 weights. This eliminates the need to change type of oil.  (Like overnight.) The warm air in your tires rises. As it cools the bottom of the tire goes “flat”. This will resolve itself once you begin to drive and the air starts to circulate again. But start off slowly. Consult with a tire retailer about snow tires and chains.   Ensure traction so you know you are safe when driving on icy roads. Check your vehicle's tire treads. Replace any tires that do not have sufficient tread. Snow tires may also be a good investment.  Know where you are. Before you leave your starting point, advise a family member, friend or neighbor of your destination and judge the approximate duration of the trip. If possible, contact those persons if you will be delayed. Notify them when you reach your destination.; , If no such item can be found, apply a very large X on the roof section of the car cover. This can be achieved with vinyl, waterproof tape or take the car cover to an upholster to have a durable, highly reflective vinyl X sewn on. On the front and rear sides of the cover, use the same methods to apply your license plate number. When not in use, keep the car cover in the trunk.  This will provide added traction while driving and the sand can be used around your tires if you become stuck.)       A camping shovel       At least one sleeping bag, preferably one that is down.       Water       Foodstuffs that can be eaten cold. (Described in Item number 4.) A small First Aid kit A small tool kit, a jack that works and a spare tire in usable condition, and jumper cables.  If it has reception, call an emergency number first, then call the persons that are aware of your route and your travel time schedule. Test the cell phone periodically. Do not try to walk over for help. Exit the car ONLY to recover items from the trunk.  Position the X on the roof the best you can. The car cover will help retain heat inside the car and repel the cold, wind, and drafts. If you are in a severe situation, the reflective X can by seen by aircraft that may be conducting a search for you. Your license plate numbers will be visible to a search and rescue team working on the ground.	Prepare your car for winter driving according to the worst weather you can expect in your area. Check your anti-freeze. If you have a garage, use it for sheltering your car. Confirm that your heater system works correctly and the core doesn't leak, the blower works and the window defroster is operating.  , Inspect the windshield wipers and replace them if they are worn or have become hardened. Examine the car's electrical system, particularly the battery and charging arrangement. Maintain fluids regularly. Expect to have “square tires” after you have had the car sitting for a while. Avoid driving in weather conditions such as a blizzard, extreme cold and high winds or in rural areas of your community. In item number 2, it was noted that a car cover should be of a bright, neon color on one side. Prepare an emergency kit to keep in your trunk containing:  Flares       Flashlight and batteries (keep in the glove box or inside the vehicle)       Candles and a lighter or matches (keep them dry in a sealed, plastic bag       Battery operated radio       Spare batteries for your cellphone and flashlight       2 bags of sand (one on each side of the trunk, near the wheel wells. If you become stranded in your car, FIRST test your cell phone. Put the car cover on the vehicle with the bright, reflective X side out.
Writing about your own experiences is always the best way to go, because you'll know how the song should feel. If you want your song to tell a story, think about each part of that story and how it feels. Make sure the story isn't too complicated, because it will be hard to understand.; , If it is a sad song, it should normally be slow. Happy songs don't have to be fast, but they are normally higher and always in the major key. If it is a dark song, it will sound great in the minor key. You can even add some chords that clash if they sound appropriate to the mood of the song and you know what you are doing. If you don't have very much musical experience, experiment and see what sound you think reflects how your song should make listeners feel.  Keep trying until you find one that is best for your song. Then see if you can find chords that go well with your melody. It won't sound as impressive if it doesn't have some chords. If putting the two together is too hard, you could just sing the melody and only play the chords. A lot of songs are like this and they sound lovely. If you don't have a piano, you can do this with another instrument or skip this step. Just plan out a melody or chorus for your song.  Make sure it is the kind of melody that will sound good with words, because some melodies sound good on an instrument but not with lyrics.  Sing each line as your write it down making sure it has the right amount of syllables. You don't always have to rhyme but some here and there sound good, as long as your rhymes make sense and don't sound like you only put them there because you couldn't think of anything better that rhymed. Repeating a stanza a few times can be nice and it helps people recognize your song faster and be able to sing it.  Touch up anything that sounds unsatisfactory. Now you have yourself a good song that came from the heart.	Think about what you want to write about. Once you know what you want to write about, start thinking about songs you've heard, with the same kind of feeling. If you have a piano, try making a basic melody. Hum your melody and add things to it until you are satisfied. Start writing your story. Put the music and Lyrics together.
Once kudzu gets going it is very hard to stop and remove. Instead, it is best to watch out for the boundaries of your land and kill any kudzu that crosses over. Some people build a stone wall, but you’ll still need to pull the vines down.Be aware that kudzu seeds can also spread deep in the ground.  Instead of chopping down vines, which can make the kudzu spread even more, erect natural barriers instead. Pile grass clippings or wood pieces around the perimeter of the land. Reinforce these barriers as often as possible to prevent encroachment., If you try to kill kudzu with chemicals, you will likely fail. Kudzu has shown itself to be very resistant to plant and weed killers. Do not apply any herbicides to kudzu that you plan to harvest for consumption.  As with most plants, kudzu does require light and oxygen in order to survive and grow. Try to kill off the kudzu by robbing it of these things by covering it up. Smother it by placing a blanket of grass clippings over the base roots. Get a tarp or plastic sheet and cover the entire kudzu plant., Bring some goats into the area and let them free graze. They are capable of eating vast amounts of kudzu shoots, significantly lessening new growth. Goats are also very capable of navigating the rough terrain that kudzu often grows in.	Keep it away from your land. Build mulch barriers. Practice caution when applying herbicide. Smother it. Let animals feed on it.
; , Fold the corner inwards on the inner fold line.  Leave a small seam allowance.  Slip stitch the diagonal line of the mitre and hem. You're done.	Fold and press (iron) the hem of the item to be mitred. Open out the hem. Cut off the corner. Refold the hem.
One of the easiest ways of all to keep your room warmer is to use the sun, mother nature's original space heater. In general, you'll want to allow as much warm sunlight into your room as possible during the day and to prevent that warmth from leaving at night. For best results, you'll also need to know which windows in your room the sun shines through — generally, these are south-facing windows in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing windows in the Southern Hemisphere.Here's simple sample schedule you may want to use:    Morning: Before you leave for work or school, close all of your room's windows. Open the blinds all the way.  Afternoon: Leave your blinds open until sun stops shining into your room. As soon as it starts to get dark and cold, close the blinds.  Night: Keep the blinds and windows closed throughout the night to preserve heat.; , In a world where the climate impact of household practices is becoming a bigger concern, many environment-conscious consumers are choosing to heat the person, not the room. Wearing a coat, a jacket, or some sweat pants indoors is a great way to stay warm without using an ounce of heating energy (or spending a penny on your heating bill.)   If your room is especially cold at night, you might try wearing layers at night. Though some people find this uncomfortable, soft garments like sweatpants and "hoodie" sweatshirts usually give the most warmth without sacrificing much comfort. Artificial fabrics that don't "breathe" like polyester, rayon, and so on generally trap the most heat (this is why they're so uncomfortable in the summer).  One of the worst feelings in the world is navigating an ice-cold room in your pajamas only to slide into a sub-zero bed. While your bed should heat up once you're in it, you can avoid this awful feeling by heating it up before you get in. A hot water bottle is one great way to do this — simply fill it with steaming water, close the lid tight, and leave it in the center of your bed under the covers 15 minutes before you go to bed.. As it cools, it will dissipate heat into your bed, leaving it nice and toasty when you get in.   Medical water bottles are available at many pharmacies for around $15 or less. If you're using a microwave to heat your water, be sure to use a microwave-safe container (like a glass or ceramic bowl).  The last thing you want when you're trying to heat a room is a draft (sometimes spelled "draught"), a spot where cool air can leak into the room. Keep any drafts plugged up with spare rags or blankets while you're waiting for a more permanent solution (like replacing a leaky window, etc.) When drafts are especially bad, this simple fix can make a big difference.   Not sure whether you have a draft? There are several ways to discover them. One is simply to hold your hand near a crack in a window or door and feel for the motion of air. You can also use a candle — if its flame flickers near a crack, you have a draft. Try the U.S. Government's draft-detecting tips at energy.gov for more ideas.  Do you have a heater or radiator in your room that doesn't seem to be making a difference when it comes to keeping you warm? Use these tips to increase their effectiveness (and save you money you'd otherwise be wasting):   Make sure there are no pieces of furniture between the heater or radiator and yourself. For instance, many older houses hide radiators behind couches. Put a sheet of tinfoil behind a radiator (use a sheet about the same a size as the radiator itself). This reflects heat that would normally be transmitted into the wall, heating the rest of the room. If your heater is portable, use it in the smallest space possible so that it can most effectively heat you. For instance, a space heater will heat a small bedroom much better than it will heat a large living room.  It's easy to forget that human beings are essentially walking, talking, biological furnaces, constantly emitting heat into the air around them. Bringing an extra person or two into the room can make a noticeable distance — your combined body heat and the heat of your exhalation will help warm the room.   Two things are important to keep in mind with this method: the smaller the room and the more physically active the people in it, the warmer it will get. In other words, a lively party in a small room will produce a lot more heat than a few people sitting on couches in a large living room. If your friends are busy, even pets can make a room a little warmer (unless they're cold-blooded — fish and lizards aren't helpful here).  This trick may seem a little ridiculous, but it does work. After all, a hair dryer is essentially a small space heater with a fan in it. You can blow hot air directly onto your bed or lift up the covers and point the hairdryer underneath to create a pocket of warm air for you to lie in.   Be careful not to touch the hot metal elements at the end of your hair dryer with your bedsheets, especially if they're made of a fabric that's prone to melting (like polyester, etc.)	Use your windows and blinds to warm your room with sunlight. Wear layers for energy-free heating. Put hot water bottle in your bed. Plug drafts with spare blankets. Make the most of existing heaters or radiators. Invite people into the room. Get a hair dryer and lightly blow the bed with the dryer.
Child-safe glue like Elmer's Glue is also made from PVA; however, it is a low-quality version of the product. Ask for bookbinder's glue to ensure you are getting a strong, durable product.   It is a good idea to choose a neutral PH adhesive. This non-acidic glue will not deteriorate the paper that you plan to glue to your wood.; ,, If you are using a very thin paper, you may find that the glue needs to be thinned in order to avoid bubbling.   You can thin the glue by adding water to it in another container. Add slowly and stir until you reach the desired consistency.  If you have painted the wood, it will be much harder to adhere the paper and you should make sure to use the glue in its original form.  Depending upon the size of the project, you may want to ask a friend to help you line it up.  Apply it to the wood's surface until you have a consistent, thin layer.  Make sure to get all corners. You can wipe up overlapping glue.    If you have extra paper, you can overlap the paper over the wood to ensure a good even surface. After it has dried, you can cut a clean edge with a razor knife and mat.  You can also wear plastic gloves and smooth the paper with your hands.  Trim the edges, if necessary.	Buy an archival polyvinyl acetate (PVA) glue from a craft shop. Wash your hands so that they are clear of all lotions and oils.  , Thin the bookbinder's glue, if need be. Prepare the wood so that it is clean and dry. Prepare the paper nearby on a hard surface. Dip a sponge or sponge brush in the PVA adhesive. Apply the PVA to the brush again and spread a thin layer on the paper's surface. Align and place the paper on the wood. Smooth the paper onto the wood with a soft, dry sponge. Allow the glue to dry overnight. Wash your sponge or sponge brush immediately after you use them to avoid hardening.
Make sure your bender is designed for EMT conduit of the size you are using. Even a universal bender may require attaching a shoe and/or follow bar designed for EMT.This article focuses on hand benders. If you are using a hydraulic or power bender (recommended for conduit with a nominal size over 2 inches), find instructions for your specific bender model. Hickey benders tend to crush or kink EMT conduit. Use a bender with a curved track for the conduit to slot into.; , A stub up bend is a 90º bend near the end of the conduit. Measure the distance on the wall from the end of the conduit to the position of the bend.  The radius of the bend will add extra length to the bent end of your conduit. Take this into account by subtracting a certain amount from your measurement:If you are using ½" EMT conduit, subtract 5" (12.7 cm). ¾" conduit: subtract 6" (15.2 cm). 1" conduit: subtract 8" (20.3 cm. 1¼" conduit: subtract 11" (27.9 cm).  Place your conduit on the floor. Measure from the end of the conduit to the new length you calculated, and mark the conduit at this point. Line the arrow symbol on your bender up so it points to this mark. Slot your bender onto the conduit. Make sure the bender handle is angled toward the end you measured from.   If your bender does not have an arrow symbol, you may need to find the instructions for your  , Your foot should provide most if not all of the pressure. Without pulling, use one hand to steady the handle on your bender, and the other to steady the conduit end once it rises within reach. Apply firm, constant foot pressure, as a pause could create a kink in your conduit.Bend until the end of the conduit is vertical, or very slightly past vertical.   If your conduit is 1¼" or larger, you may need an assistant to operate the handle.  Attach a level to the vertical length of conduit. If necessary, make small adjustments to the bend until the bubble of the level is centered. The conduit will flex back slightly after you remove the bender, so bending slightly too far will provide the best results.	Select the correct bender. Measure the desired length of the stub. Subtract the take-up height. Line the arrow mark on your bender to this measurement. Press down on the foot pedal to bend the conduit. Confirm the bend with a spirit level (recommended).

Look at public train schedules and maps for your city to see if they cover routes serving your origin and destination. You’ll save time, spend less money on fuel and parking, and cut down on pollution. Plus, you can read, relax, or get work done during the commute.  While not always as efficient as rail, metropolitan bus networks commonly serve broader areas, and can save you money on fuel and parking. On the highway and in city streets, buses can sometimes take advantage of bus-only lanes that bypass traffic.  If you live fairly close to work, try going there by bicycle instead of driving. You might find that your travel time is not much different from when you were driving to and from work in traffic. Plus you’ll get some fresh air, save money on fuel, and get a good amount of exercise.  Alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and busing will be much more practical if you can manage to live as close as possible to your place of work. But if locating close to your job isn’t an option, at least try to live near a public transportation route that connects your residence and place of work.	Take advantage of rail systems. Try taking the bus. Consider riding your bike. Find a residence close to work.
You can also do it to more, just make sure the number of spoons is divisible by four. , Do this with the other groups of three spoons.    You can also use more spoon tops on the top or bottom of the butterfly to create different sized wings. For example, to have bigger top wings than bottom ones, you would have three spoons for each wing on the top and two spoons for each wing on the bottom.  You may also paint the spoons (make sure the paint can adhere to the plastic.) If you're going to paint the spoons, you will need a couple coats of paint so the butterfly will look bright — so there won't be any streaky bits of plastic showing.	Repeat Steps 1 to 2 in the first method (the simple butterfly), but instead of using four spoons, do this to 12 spoons. Use the handle of one of the spoons as the body again.  , For the wings, glue three of the spoon tops together to create a wing shape. Let the glue dry, then attach the wing shaped spoon tops to the body. Decorate your butterfly with jewels, glitter, or sharpies as desired.
Many owner's manuals never even mention steering fluid, and despite the urging of some mechanics, there is growing disagreement that a full flush is really needed for most cars.If the fluid doesn't smell burnt and there are no metallic bits in the fluid, you can get by with a simpler "flush."   If your fluid is dark or you are losing sleep worrying about your car, this simple procedure will refresh your fluid for the foreseeable future., This is usually labeled with a steering wheel icon on the cap.  Note the color and consistency of the fluid. If it smells burnt or has bits of metal in it, you'll need to do a full flush of the system. Note the current level of the fluid.  This will take some time, and you will not get everything, but this is a simple and easy way to get old fluid out without a complicated flush., This simple procedure will protect your car, cheaply, and is just as effective a method as a full flush if you have no other problems. The power steering system is, relatively speaking, rather clean and simple. Unlike other fluids, like oil, the power steering system doesn't even need a filter. This quick "refresher" is likely all you'll need to do to keep your wheels turning easily.   Many cars don't even recommend changing this fluid — you'll be ahead of the game if you even do this.  Drive the car around, recirculating the fluid, and repeat a few weeks later if you want a full "flush." This won't get everything out, but more than enough to keep your car running happily.	Recognize that flushing power steering is not necessarily essential. Locate the power steering fluid reservoir on your engine. Mark the current level and condition of the power steering fluid. Use a turkey baster to suction the old fluid out of the reservoir. Refill the reservoir to its prior level with fresh fluid. Repeat the process a few weeks later to fully refresh the fluid.
Run your washing machine and allow it to fill with hot water. Use the highest load size when doing this as well., Open the lid while the washer is running. Use a measuring cup to measure and pour four cups (946.35 ml) of white vinegar into the washer as it fills., For an even deeper cleaning, you can add baking soda to the water. Measure out a cup (236.58 ml) of baking soda and carefully pour it into the water in your machine., Allowing your machine to run will let the vinegar and baking soda wash away a lot of the dirt and grime on the inside of your washing machine., Letting the hot water and vinegar sit in your washing machine for an hour will help pull away leftover grime and dirt from within the machine., Use a clean cloth and citrus cleaner to wash down the rest of your washing machine. Citrus cleaners are great at removing limescale, soap scum and buildup. You can purchase citrus cleaners at the store or you can make them at home. Spray the cleaner in dirty areas and use the cloth to wipe up the grime and dirt.Citrus cleaners use the natural properties found in fruits like lemons, oranges, and limes to remove dirt. When cleaning, make sure to wipe off the fabric softener and bleach reservoirs that are on your washer. You can also use a toothbrush to get to hard to reach places.  Close the lid and finish the cycle in your washing machine. Wait until the cycle completes and all the water has drained from the machine.  Finish cleaning out the interior of the washing machine with a dry rag. Once it's dry, you can repeat the steps to finish cleaning the remaining dirt or gunk that's built up inside of your machine.	Set your washing machine to the hottest temperature and longest cycle. Add four cups (946.35 ml) of white vinegar to the washer. Pour a cup (236.58 ml) of baking soda to the water. Close the lid and let the washing machine run for 5 minutes. Open the lid and pause the machine for an hour. Wipe the outside of your machine while your machine is paused. Finish the washing machine's cycle. Wipe down the interior of the machine and repeat.
Metal is considered a "counter-culture," meaning it opposes "the normal, functional, and unexciting Culture that was dominant in society by being outside of that which was in power, Counter-culturalists argued, they were able to see what was real." So when you before you begin writing, erase any preconceived notions that you have about a particular topic.  Metal music focuses on darker topics that match the heaviness of the music and skirt the "popular" beliefs of society. The topics often challenge the listeners’ political, religious, emotional, philosophical, and/or social beliefs. Select a topic that you have experience with or have a strong connection to, this is going to make the rest of the process much easier.   Popular topics for metal songs include war, personal angst, mental disease, mythology, tragedy, death, hate, intolerance, corruption and love.  Once you have selected the topic, you want to spend time formulating what your thoughts on the subject are. Unlike popular music, metal pulls from real "truths" rather than perceived "morals" or popular "beliefs" on the subject.    Start with what is "society's perspective." Think of what the culture promotes as the correct "belief" or "moral" in the discussion of that topic. It will be easier if you can find a belief that you find to be counter-intuitive, paradoxical or illogical such "war for peace," "religiously-motivated murder," or "victim-blaming."  Contrast that to examples based on experience. Take a real life, personal or a fictional example that challenges the mainstream beliefs behind this topic. How has your experience challenged society's view?  Make note of any other arguments, perspectives, or facts surrounding this topic. What kind of things do people say about the subject? What promotes these beliefs? What are the consequences behind this ethical belief? Who does this affect?  Find a "truth" within the topic. Based solely on the examples that challenge that perspective, what truths can you logically pull out? This truth will become the main thrust of your song.  Unlike other popular music, there is not a standard song format such as "verse-chorus-verse-chorus." Instead, create your own structure based on the topic. Is there an important message that can be repeated?Do you want to provide the listener with a resolution? Here are some basic elements of the dramatic structure you can include:    What is the rising action? What examples or personal experiences can you include to bring the listener to agree with your song's main "truth"?  What is the climax? Can you create a moment where the listener can throw out the societal norms or absolute "morals" that they had?  What is the resolution? What did these examples teach the listener? What did you learn?  , Don't stick to "rhyming patterns" or "rules behind poetry." Many popular metal songs don't necessarily rhyme or follow traditionally. Instead just weave together the basic parts you created in the last step. Tell your "story" to the listener.  Literary devices that work particularly well in metal music include personification, allegories, figurative language, imagery, metaphors and synecdoches. Some helpful ways to find out what devices will work with your topic include:   What popular images are associated with that topic? (Metaphors, allegories, personification, synecdoches, etc.) What observations can you pull from this topic? (Imagery, etc.) Is there fiction or mythology that you can pull from? (Metaphors, allegories, etc.)  , Use wikiHow to Write Power Metal Music to create the sound behind your lyrics.  Sometimes the music doesn't match up with the sound. So play the music and sing the lyrics to find where these inconsistencies are. Then edit either the music or the sound to fit the emotion behind what you are saying/hearing.  Their fans were often disenfranchised youth who felt no connection to the free-love movement of the 1970s or the societal norms of the 1970s. They discussed topics that directly affected these youths and were relevant to what was going on in the world during that time.; , This topic was perfect for the period where America used military force to achieve political change. In choosing this, they could speak out against the basic "American" beliefs behind the war effort.    Societal beliefs: Society believed that war could bring peace.  Experiences: War breeds more pain, suffering and destruction. Politicians start war, because they don't have to deal with those tragedies themselves.  Other observations: It's the poor that fight, people die in masses, the generals guide soldier into certain death.  The "truth": Politicians have the power and misuse it.  They really focused less on rhyming and more on creating a vivid story with a rise, climax and a resolution.    Rising Action: "Generals gathered in their masses," "In the fields the bodies burning," and "Evil minds that plot destruction" are all examples of realistic experiences and observations that Black Sabbath pulled from.  Climax: "Politicians hide themselves away" and "Wait 'til their judgement day comes" support that from the examples, politicians will eventually be held responsible for what they did.  Resolution: "Now in darkness world stops turning," and "No more war pigs have the power" explain that eventually the people will rise up, and take back the power from the politicians. This provides a solution to the problems that existed in the rising action.  Finding ways to make the lines fit together and to create a "story." They tied the rising action to the climax with the "oh lord yeah" which foreshadows the resolution of judgement day.  Black Sabbath changed these experiences and facts surrounding war into something more meaningful and symbolic with literary devices. They weaved these ideas throughout the song, focusing on the main literary device of personification of "war pigs."   Popular images of "tanks," "machines," and "battle fields" are all references in the song. Observations like the masses being gathered and a chess game being played are also depicted. Fictitious and mythological images of "sorcerers" and "witches" are used in the song.	Understand the meaning behind Metal Music. Pick a topic. Brainstorm the topic. Start to weave together the basic parts of the song. Develop and formulate the lyrical poem. Consider finding a literary device(s) to add depth to the song. Develop the sound to go with the lyrics. Come back to the song, and revise as necessary. Black Sabbath set out to create Metal's counter-culture. They choose the topic of war. Black Sabbath then started to weave together these basic ideas into the song, "War Pigs". Black Sabbath began to formulate these basic parts of the song together. Literary devices were used to add depth to the song.
If you have ferns that are already growing in your garden, you likely won’t need to move them unless they’re showing signs of ill health. Ferns like lots of shade and moisture, and do well under the canopy of a few other larger plants or trees. Plant (or transplant) ferns onto a plot that gets northern sun and no direct sunlight. If ferns are left in an area with direct sunlight, their leaves will burn.  If it does not rain regularly in your area, you’ll need to water your ferns on a daily basis so that the soil is kept moist. Add a dense layer of pine needle or leaf mulch to the tops of your ferns; about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) thick is ideal. This will help to lock in moisture and keep the rate of evaporation relatively low, so that the air near the ferns is a bit more humid.  Six months after the original planting, you can begin fertilizing the ferns for added growth. Select an organic fertilizer that is spray-on, and apply it to the ferns (following package directions). Additionally, you can add a layer of compost and mulch to the soil to create a better growing environment for the ferns. Do keep in mind that ferns have a lesser requirement of fertilizer than other common houseplants.  Ferns don’t have many natural predators outdoors, other than slugs and one or two rare diseases. If, however, you notice that your fern has damaged or diseased fronds, use a pair of gardening shears to cut them back. This will keep the integrity of the rest of the plant, and if it is a disease, prevent it from spreading to other plants.  Ferns can get quite large over time, and require splitting and transplanting. To divide a large fern into several smaller ferns, carefully dig out the plant and its roots. Carefully break apart the plant into sections; typically, the fern will grow in clumps making it easy to split. Then replant each of these, and water them well.	Plant ferns in the ideal location. Keep the soil moist. Fertilize the ferns once a month. Cut back damaged fronds. Transplant if necessary.
Not only should they be purchased from a reliable brand, but they should be the right tires for your vehicle type and the season. Check the vehicle user's manual for advice, and discuss your options with the retailer before purchasing.; , They should be free of imperfections, such as nicks, cuts or holes. If you see anything that you're not sure about, ask first.   If purchasing used or reconditioned tires, check even more thoroughly, especially for puncture signs. After purchase, do a regular check for cuts, holes, embedded stones, etc., at least every few days. The earlier you spot a problem, the easier it will be to fix the affected tire and keep it in good condition.  This may be costly but it is safer, as all the tires will have the same amount of tread and there will be less chance of uneven wear caused by leaving on existing tires.If you do choose to only replace two tires, is recommended that you place the new tires on the rear axle. This is because the new grip will give you better control in difficult driving conditions, as the rear wheels are not connected to the steering wheel.However, this may depend on your vehicle's requirements, so always check the user's manual for advice.  In addition, read the tire manufacturer's requirements. That way you will be aware of any unique requirements that are relevant to either your car or the tires you've purchased.  Balancing is an important way to prevent early demise of your tires; get the tires balanced each time that you purchase new ones; they should balance properly on the wheel mounts.   If a tire is unbalanced, it will cause uneven wear on the tire tread. It can also cause the car to vibrate and front end parts of the car may also wear out faster.  Do a monthly tire check when the tires are cold (at least three hours since driving). Check the tire pressure to see if it is at the point recommended by the vehicle user's manual. Tires that are under- or over-inflated will wear faster and won't perform as they should to maintain grip and keep you safe on the road. By maintaining the right pressure in your car's tires, you can help them to last longer.   Use a tire gauge to check the tires. These are available from auto supplies stores and hardware stores. The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle can usually be found in the vehicle user's handbook, on the car manufacturer's website, on a label inside the door or inside the gas tank flap. The inflation level shown on the tire refers to its maximum level of inflation, not the recommended tire pressure; don't confuse the two!  , At the same time that you do a monthly tire check, also check the tread for wear. Tread is related directly to grip and traction, so the more worn the tread is, the less grip it has. Worn tread on new tires is an indicator of a problem, and you should have the car checked by a mechanic to see what the problem might be and have it fixed quickly.  It should also be checked as quickly as possible after hitting the wheels on something. For example, if you bang the wheels into a curb or into a pothole, etc., they may go out of alignment. If this misalignment is not corrected, the tires will wear faster and this may compromise your steering and safety.   Wheel alignment checking should also occur after noticing irregular tread wear.  Rotation of the tires at the intervals advised by the manual can help preserve them for longer.  Do not regularly screech to a halt, storm off from the traffic lights or speed over the mandated limit. All of these actions cause additional wear and tear on your tires and reduce the longevity of your tires (not to mention wasting fuel).	Purchase good quality tires. Inspect the new tires before agreeing to buy them. Try to replace all four tires at once. Read the instructions related to tires in the vehicle user's manual. Ensure that the tire balance has been checked upon fitting the tires after purchase. Inspect the tire pressure regularly. Inspect the wear of the tire tread regularly. Check the wheel alignment yearly. Rotate the tires as advised in the vehicle user's manual. Drive with a view to maintaining sensible speeds and avoiding actions that might harm the tires.
Audacity is a free, open source software program available for download off their website. Follow the download instruction, then install Audacity. Once installed (a computer restart may be necessary) open Audacity and click File, then Open, or press Ctrl+O (Command-O on a Macintosh).; , Click Open. Two large, blue oscilloscope-like shapes will appear on the screen—one for the left channel (bottom) and one for the right (top).  Press pause, and then zoom in on that section.   Continue zooming and rewinding until you can place your cursor on the exact part of the blue line that begins the foul word.  Verify you have the right selection by clicking on the green Play arrow.  Click "Generate" on the popup window to complete the silence.  Tone—This selection will make a tone with a pitch that you can vary in the window which appears. This is a "television style" edit. Use the settings shown: If you're musically inclined, you can set the pitch of the beep to be the same as the key of the song. For example, if the song is in the key of A (major or minor), set frequency to 880Hz. Keep the Amplitude low to begin with, especially if you don't choose Sine wave—you can always undo and make it a bit louder if it's too soft. You can also click the Effect menu and select Wahwah, setting resonance to 6.0. This makes the voice make another traditional radio edit sound, while leaving the beat rather than silence, although it does not work for all curse words.  Take care so that the inserted section is the same number of samples as the deleted section, and if possible, make sure the waveforms line up at the beginning and the end.  If you inserted a tone, for example, you'll see what looks like a solid block:  , Rewind to a few seconds before the word, then press the play button to hear your effect. If it's not to your liking, simply undo, then try other methods till you find something acceptable. , Then, click the effects button again and at the top it will say Repeat Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift. Click that button two or three times more and for the f word it will make a sound like 'fuwwww' or for the b word 'bewwww'.	Obtain music editing software. Browse to the song file (.mp3, .wma, or .wav) you wish to edit. Press the play icon on the toolbar and listen to the song until you reach the part of the song with the vulgar word. With your cursor, click and drag in the waveform area to select the duration of the inappropriate word. Press the stop icon (the orange square), click on the Generate menu, and select one of the following options:    Silence—This selection will eliminate all sound from the selection, creating a traditional "radio edit.", Tip for the really musically-inclined: Take an instrumental section that matches the key and rhythm of the offending section, and replace the offending section with the instrumental bit. Note the change of the waveform display. Test your edit. Enjoy your music without the profanity.  , Alternatively select the curse word, press the effects tab at the top and go down to Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift and where it says Final Pitch Shift (Semitones): type in -12.000 and click okay.
Note: The suitability of the soil to grow grass often correlates with the suitability of the soil for a landing strip. Too much clay will produce a soupy mess when wet, for example.	Stability especially in poor weather.
This type of book club gathers a collection of books for its members to borrow. The more people you invite, the larger and more interesting your library. That said, for logistics reasons you may want to start with ten people or fewer.  There are two common ways this type of club can function:   Each member loans the club 1-3 books each meeting. Alternatively, each member donates a certain amount of money each meeting. The host for that month (a rotating position) spends the money to buy books for the club to enjoy.  Unless you have a communal space to store the books, the book club usually only borrows or returns books once every month or two. This is also a good chance to trade recommendations and socialize.   It's usually easiest to have one person store the book collection and host the meetings, so you don't have to transport the books. Consider putting out a donation box to reimburse this host for his time.  Here are a few suggested rules to keep the club running smoothly:   Each member can borrow one book at a time. Each book is due back after a certain amount of time (such as two months). Set a small fine for late books, to be put in a communal fund for snacks or similar expenses. Set a larger fine for lost or damaged books, to be given to the original owner of the book.  For space reasons, most clubs won't want to keep their collection growing endlessly. After a book has been around for a certain period of time (say 6 to 12 months), return it to its original owner or purchaser.  One person should be responsible for a document that lists every book in the collection, with the following information:   Who currently has the book (if anyone). When the book is due back in the collection. The original owner/purchaser. When the book is due to return to the original owner/purchaser.	Come up with a member list. Set rules for book acquisition. Decide where and when to meet. Write down the loan policy. Set a return schedule. Assign a member to track the loans.
In order to dye yarn in a slow cooker, you must choose the right type. You can only use undyed yarn made from protein-based fibers, such as wool or silk. The process won’t work on plant-based fibers, such as cotton, bamboo, or flax, or synthetic yarns, such as acrylic or nylon.You can use yarn that’s a blend of protein-based and other fibers as long as it’s at least 50 % protein-based. For example, you could use yarn that’s 75% wool and 25% nylon.; , To prepare the yarn for dyeing, you need to wrap the yarn in large loop that’s approximately 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.2 m) (91 to 122 cm) long so it’s easier to work with. Wind it around the back of a chair to create the loop, and use a piece of synthetic yarn that won’t dye to loosely tie it so it’s secure.If you purchase yarn in a hank, or a big circle, you don’t need to tie it in a loop. A ball or skein of yarn must be tied in a loop, though. You may want to secure the loop of yarn in one more than one location to ensure that it stays wrapped up while you work with it.  Find a large bowl that’s big enough to hold the yarn. Pour 8 cups (1.89 l) of warm water into the bowl, and add ⅔ cup (158 ml) of white vinegar. Mix the solution with a wooden spoon to ensure that the water and vinegar are fully combined.The water doesn’t need to be hot. It should be between 95 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 41 degrees Celsius).  Once you’ve mixed the water and vinegar, take the loop of yarn and place it in the mixture. Push it down into the water and hold it under until it is saturated enough to remain under the water on its own. Allow the yarn to soak for at least 30 minutes.Soaking the yarn in the vinegar mixture helps soften the fibers so the yarn will absorb the color more easily.  To ready the slow cooker for dyeing, plug it in. Turn the heat to high, so it can begin to heat up.For the best results, use a slow cooker that holds at least 6-quarts (5.7 l). If you are using a non-food coloring to dye your yarn, such as a fabric dye, you shouldn’t use the same slow cooker that you use for preparing food. You may want to buy a second slow cooker just for dyeing yarn at a thrift or discount store. You can add a liner to the interior of the slow cooker if you’re worried about the dye coloring it.  After you’ve turned the slow cooker on, pour enough water into it to fill it halfway. Allow the water to heat for 2 to 3 minutes, so it’s slightly warm when you add the coloring.There should be enough water in the slow cooker to cover the yarn completely. Start by filling it half way. If the yarn isn’t covered once you place it in the slow cooker, you can pour in more water.  When the water has had time to warm slightly, add food coloring in your chosen color to it. The amount of coloring you should add depends on how dark or bright you want the yarn’s color to be. Use a spoon to mix it into the water until it’s fully combined.For the best results, use synthetic food coloring. Vegetable-based food colorings typically don’t work as well. You can also use powdered food drink mix, such as Kool Aid, to dye the yarn. Fabric dye also works well to dye yarn, but it will leave you unable to use the slow cooker to make meals again in the future. It’s best to start with a small amount of coloring or dye. If you aren’t happy with the color of the yarn when it’s finished cooking, you can add more coloring and allow it cook longer. You can get an idea of how the color will turn out by sprinkling a few drops of the colored water on a piece of white paper towel. Create a custom shade for your yarn by mixing two or more food coloring colors.  After you’ve added the coloring to the water, lift the yarn out of the vinegar solution. Set it immediately in the slow cooker, making sure that it’s completely covered by the colored water.There’s no need to wring out the yarn after you take it out of the vinegar solution.  If the yarn isn’t completely covered with the color solution, add extra water to the slow cooker. That may mean you need to mix in additional coloring or dye as well., When the yarn is completely covered with the colored water, place the lid on the slow cooker. Allow the yarn to cook in the colored solution for 3 to 8 hours, or until the water becomes clear because all of the color has been absorbed.Don’t stir or move the yarn while it’s cooking. If you allow the yarn to cook in the slow cooker until the water is clear and it still isn’t as dark as you’d like, lift the yarn out of the water and add more coloring or dye. Mix it in to ensure that it’s fully combined, return the yarn to the slow cooker, and allow it to cook until the water is clear again.  When the yarn is the color that you want, lift it out of the slow cooker. Place it in a colander in the sink, and allow it to cool for at least 15 minutes.When you place the yarn in the colander, press down on it to release the excess liquid in the fibers.  When the yarn is cool enough to handle, turn on the water in your sink. Rinse the yarn under lukewarm water until the water runs clear., After the yarn is rinsed, place it on a dry towel. Wrap the towel around the yarn and press it to remove the extra moisture.It’s best to use an old towel because some dye may transfer from the yarn to the towel. You can also place the yarn in your washing machine on the spin cycle or spin it in a salad spinner to remove the excess moisture.  When the excess moisture is removed from the yarn, unwrap it from the loop and hang in a warm area of your home to dry. It may take as long as a day for the yarn to dry completely.When the yarn is dry, you can roll it back up in a ball or wrap it in another loop.	Choose a protein-based yarn. Tie the yarn in a loop. Combine some vinegar and water. Place the yarn in the vinegar mixture and let it sit. Heat the slow cooker. Fill the slow cooker half way with water. Mix the coloring into the water. Place the yarn in the colored water. Add more water to cover the yarn if necessary. Cover the slow cooker and cook the yarn for several hours. Transfer the yarn to a colander and cool it. Run the yarn under lukewarm water. Dry the yarn with a towel. Allow the yarn to air dry.
Locate your wire and cut it to the desired length. You don’t want too much slack, so try anywhere from 3 inches to a foot. This wire will connect the switch to the capacitor. You’ll also need to strip the wire from the rubber casing.  Solder the wire to one of the two terminals of the capacitor. Use a quality soldering gun to avoid a messy circuit board. Solder a blob of lead free rosin core to the surface. Then heat the wire to the blob with your soldering gun. It should dry shortly to create a firm connection.         , Take the wire you just soldered to the capacitor and attach it to the “off” side of the switch. You might need to solder the wire onto the switch, but most switches you buy have screwable ports for wires.  Wrap a strip of tape around your circular object with the adhesive side facing outward until it overlaps. Now take the enamel coated wire and wrap it 7-15 times. Leave some wire out to attach to the terminals. Don’t overlap any of the coil. Take time and be precise. Make sure the wire is snug and that there aren’t any spatial gaps.          Coat the finished wiring with tape so it’s secure. Slide the windings off the object. Cut the terminals of the coils to the desired length, but make sure you leave yourself enough room to work with., Using sandpaper, file down the tips of the wire to remove the enamel coat. This will create a stronger bond between the components.  Attach a strand of coil to the other terminal of the capacitor. Use care and don’t create a mess.          Solder onto the opposite side of the switch.  Connect one of the leads of the coil to the other “on” terminal of the switch., Make sure your battery for the device is charged and in place. Test the device on a handheld video game. Newer models might not work. Insert the electronic device into the circular coil and flip the switch.	Prepare your wire. Solder the wire. Attach to the switch. Prepare your coil. Remove the enameled coat. Solder the coil to the capacitor. Attach the coil to the switch. Fire when ready.
This means that if the words were , "She falls like the petal drifting from it's rose," you would gracefully sink to the floor and pretend to be the petal. Fluent is where you pour your heart and feelings out with your movements. Let's just say if you danced fluent to the rose petal line, you would probably feel sad because "she is drifting", so you would show that with a sad, but graceful, drift away from the center.; , It would get very boring to watch someone do the same movement over, and over, and over again.  The best places are the ones with a large lengthy mirror on the wall. , You should listen to it maybe 2-3 time to get the feel of the words, instruments, and the tempo.  This is a key part in getting better. You don't want to pull a muscle and not be able to practice, so be sure to stretch your arms, legs, neck, and maybe do some push-ups. If you plan on doing tricks, be sure to stretch extra well, so you won't get injured.  This sometimes is a hard concept for some people to understand. When you dance fluently, like the water in a stream, you let your body pretend you are trapped under the ocean. (Pretend you can still breathe) You would get bored just standing there with nothing to do, so you start to flow. Your limbs are floating, your heart lies on a cloud, your eyes are closed. You outstretch your fingers and open your mind to more fluent movement. You touch the sky with every reach and skim the ocean's sandy floor while the suns rays dance around you. This is how it feels to dance fluent. You move your arms and legs and head so they flow gracefully together.  To make your dance stand out, you may want to add tricks. There are hundreds of dance tutorials online. Chose a tutorial from an actual known dancer(so you can guarantee it's safe) and follow the teacher. Some examples of tricks are pirouettes, splits, barrel rolls, jumps, and leaps.	Understand that when you dance lyrical, your movements show the words of the song. Try to come up with lots of different feelings and moves. Find a stage, an open place, such as a basement, or even outside in your front lawn (if you do do this, make sure there is an outlet so you can plug in a CD player). Pick a song with deep meaning and flowing music, otherwise it gets a little harder to stay fluent with your movements.  , Listen to the song. Do your body a favor; before you dance, make sure you stretch. Just let your body flow. Learn tricks.
Otherwise, you can irritate it. What's more, you want to work with a clean palette.; , Give special emphasis to the area below your eye, nearest your nose. Smudge the eye pencil with a tissue wrapped around your finger for a smoother look. Be sure to let the edges of the "bruise" fade realistically.   Highlight immediately beneath your eye and the line that forms a crescent shape underneath your eye. These two areas get very puffy and inflamed when hit.  Highlight the edge of the nose that got hit (near the corner of the eye) and just below the eye, where the last knuckle would land.   A cream-based shadow may be more effective, but matte powder will work, too.  Use a stipple sponge, if you have it, to mimic a scrape. Concentrate the red on the corner of the eye near the tear duct and at the top of the cheekbone near the outer edge of the eye.  Dab the brush on your hand before applying to make sure you're not accidentally concentrating too much product on any one area.  Add these colors at the outer corner of your eye, your orbital bone, and the lower edge of the "bruise". When a bruise fades, it turns more to this end of the color spectrum.	Wash and dry your skin before you begin. Smear black eye pencil around your entire eye socket, including your eyelid. Apply a coat of matte, dark purple eyeshadow over the eye pencil. Apply some dark red eyeshadow or lipstick in small amounts. Add dark blue or dark maroon eyeshadow to the inner corner of the eye and along the eyelid. Finish by blending in yellow or light green.
You will need tempera paint, an old tray, washing-up liquid, a sponge, construction paper, and a container., Combine a cup of washing-up liquid and a few tablespoons of paint until properly mixed through using the drinking straw.,, Press the soup onto the paper using the sponge, until you have as many pretty bubble patterns and designs as desired. Use multiple colors for an extra vibrant piece of art., Hang it up and enjoy!	Gather your supplies. Mix the liquid and and paint.Lay the watercolor paper on the old tray. Make the bubble art. Allow your piece of art to dry.
The battery should be located in an accessible part on either side of the car's frame. The battery is a rectangular box with two cables attached to it. Some European cars (some BMW's) have the battery under the matting in the trunk, some vehicles can have the battery located under the rear seat, or some are located inside the fender of the wheel well (some Chrysler's). The latter is often very difficult to remove.  Locate the positive and the negative terminals of the old car battery. The positive terminal will have a plus sign (and is often red) and the negative terminal will have a minus sign (and is often black).  Loosen the negative cable clamp with a wrench (Usually 8mm or 10mm) and slide it off of the terminal. If the cables are unmarked, label them so that they don't get mixed up (otherwise you may ruin your car's electric system later on). It is also important that you disconnect the negative terminal socket before the positive terminal socket. Otherwise, you may short circuit the positive terminal to a grounded part of the car. , Unfasten the battery holder and remove any screws, clamps or bars holding the battery in place. Carefully lift the battery out of the car. Remember that a battery can weigh 30 to 60 pounds, or 13.5 to 27 kilos, so if you have any back problems, get a helping hand.	Locate the battery. Identify battery terminals. Disconnect the negative terminal. Disconnect the positive terminal.  , Remove the car battery.
Go out to watch at midnight or later. The pre-dawn hours are usually the best for viewing because the side of the Earth facing the sun allows more meteors to be visible., Mittens or gloves and a warm hat are also a good idea for those who feel the cold at night.   Bring a reclining chair if you don't fancy lying on the ground or holding your head tilted back all night.  Planning a camping trip at this time is a great option.  If you are unsure of your orientation, use your compass or an app to get your bearings and determine which direction is northeast.  The meteors can be seen using the naked eye.  For closer views, use binoculars or a camera with a telescopic lens. You don't have to use these to appreciate the meteors, however, and these can limit your field of vision, causing you to miss the ongoing show if you don't know where to look.  The stars of Perseus form somewhat of a "Y" or "V" shape and the meteors will seem to shoot outwards from a central point in this constellation. They will be visible, however, all over the sky.   Perseus can be found by following the bottom left star in Cassiopeia (the W constellation) down and to the left. There is a double cluster that appears the meteor shower is coming from.  The tripod is important to provide stability during long exposures and limit the camera movement when you take the photos.   Put the camera focus on "infinity" and use an open shutter over a period of minutes if your camera has this capability. Read wikiHow's article on photographing the night sky for more information.	Set your alarm clock. Pack a blanket, compass, bug spray, and snacks. Find a spot away from city lights. Look towards the northeastern sky. View the sky with your unaided vision. Look for the constellation Perseus. Bring along a tripod if you want to take photographs.
Most of the materials mentioned in the things you'll need section can be procured at online shopping sites or hardware retail shops. Some, such as the laser diode, can be found in other electronic devices such as a disk burner.; , Many countries have laws governing the use and power of laser pointers. You can even be prosecuted for having a laser pointer which exceeds the permissible power limit. Be sure to keep the law in mind and tone down your laser pointer as and when necessary.  You will need to drill two holes in the casing. Drill one on the top of the casing. This will be the switch. Drill another hole on the side of the casing for the laser.  Some casings come with laser diodes built in. If your casing comes with a built in laser diode, check whether it is powerful enough for your needs. If it isn't, gently remove the laser diode and replace it with a new one.  Any battery pack will do, as long as it is powerful enough.  You can solder pins on the laser diode to make the attachment easier.  Add a switch, and solder all the components to the casing.  Check whether it works. If it doesn't , you may need to replace the power source or check whether all the components are attached correctly.	Gather your materials. Keep the law in mind. Drill the holes. Insert the laser diode into the casing. Add a power source to your laser. Attach the power source to the laser diode. Put on the finishing touches. Test your laser pointer.
Quantities for each ingredient will vary, dependent on the size and amount of candles you plan to make. However, half a pound of wax equals to 10-12 small candles, and candles only require one wick each. You should check your mould tray for a point of reference if you're unsure about quantity.          Paraffin wax.Half a pound of wax should serve you well for a home set of candles. If you're feeling thrifty however, you can melt down old candles into fresh wax. Drops of essential oil. These are essential, and can be used if you want to give your candles a scent. Only a couple of drops per candle will be needed to get the scent. Baking tray mould. The size of your mould will determine how large the candles will be. Small muffin candles will burn for approximately one hour. Large muffin tray candles will go on for about three.Tart moulds and cookie cutters can be used as well for this, so long as there's a moulded slot for a candle to settle in. Pretabbed candle wicks. Making sure to get pretabbed wicks can take some of the hassle out of adding them into the wax. Dye chips.Dye chips are specifically made for use in homemade candles. They're small, but effective, so you'll probably only need around one per candle. You can eyeball the effects of the dye chips as you add them.; , If you're using a double boiler, bring the outside water to a boil first before adding the wax. A double boiler is prepared by filling a larger pot with water to boil, and setting a smaller pot in the middle. The boiling water on the outside will heat up whatever's inside the smaller pot.         Do not apply direct heat to candle wax. It can catch fire if you do. An empty coffee can will suffice for heating candle wax if you don't have an extra pot or pitcher to place in your double boiler.A small coffee can is a good alternative for someone who doesn't have a pot large enough to make a double boiler.  One dye chip per pound of wax should be enough to ensure a bold colour. It's important to add your dye while the candles are heated. That way, they'll be able to disperse throughout the wax with stirring. Dye chips are designed specifically for use in DIY candle-making, so they tend to mix with wax very well.         Mix it in with a wooden spoon to ensure the dye is consistent in the candles. Essential oils are added for the sake of scent, and should be added to the pot as soon as you've turned off the heat.  Paraffin wax needs to be 150 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be ready for pouring.If you have a thermometer at hand, place it in the wax and gauge the temperature. Check the consistency periodically. You can do this by placing a wooden spoon in the boiler pitcher and gently stirring the wax around.          If you don't have a thermometer, wait until a thin film forms around the edges of your pitcher., Because you'll ultimately be taking them up held by their fragile wick, you'll want to minimize that resistance early on.          Excessive spray isn't necessary. Just make sure the bottom of each mould slot is evenly sprayed. Being thorough at this stage prevents hassle later down the road.  Pour it into each of the holes in your mould, and try to get the wax as evenly distributed as possible. If you don't have enough, you should be able to eyeball how much more you'll need to heat to finish the job.          Pour slowly and steadily. The wax will be hot, and pouring it quickly could risk injuring yourself. Cookie cutters are a great alternative. You'll be able to make interesting shapes out of your candle wax.To make a cookie cutter into a mould, run masking tape along the edge and bend the cutter so it can rest firmly on a sheet of aluminum foil. This will be a good makeshift foundation for the candles to rest upon. Muffin tray are the most common choice for homemade candle moulds. However, you can use just about any type of mould your kitchen has to offer, so long as the slots are small enough to make working floating candles.  Give the heated wax a few minutes to settle and cool. From there, you should be able to add wicks with the hopes they'll stand up in the wax. Tabbed wicks are generally easier to add because the tab helps to guide and secure the wick in place.          You can use a toothpick or bamboo skewer to fix the wick after adding it if it falls., Once the wicks have set, candles take up to two hours to harden completely.Set them aside, and occupy your time with something else while they settle.  Once your candle have been given enough time to settle, pull them up gently using the wicks. Use a piece of paper towel to wipe off any extra gunk away from the candles once they've removed and ready to set.         If you try to take out the candles too soon, they'll become harder to remove. If you've made this mistake and want to fix it, put them in the freezer for a few minutes, then take them out and try again., You should aim for one with a wide base to ensure the most room for candles. Glass orbs with a to-the-side opening are a great choice with floating candles, as the surrounding glass helps intensify the flame light.  You can get this impression further across by decorating the base of the vase. Adding sand to the bottom will give the vase an aquatic vibe. Using decorative gems will give your vase fantasy-based atmosphere.          Clear and coloured stones are both welcome additions to the base of the vase as well.It's best to keep your base to a single type of decoration. Otherwise, it will look messy and hurt the atmosphere. Shake the pot gently around to get the stones evenly across the base. Make sure you add the stones before the water to avoid making a mess when you spread the foundation.  For the maximum effect, you should fill your vase between 50-75% with water. Add your stones or other base decorations to the vase before filing with water. This will eliminate the risk of splashing, and make it easier to even out the stones across the base.  Place the unlit candles gently in the pot holding the wick. Don't try to put them in holding the wax, as you'll risk capsizing them in the water. Continue to add the candles until the pot begins to look crowded. Try not to overcrowd the pot, as this will hurt the peaceful aesthetic you're trying to create.  If your pot as a wide opening and there aren't a lot of candles, you can light them with a regular pocket lighter. In most cases however, a trigger-operated firestarter is preferable. With a firestarter, you can stick the fire nozzle into the pot without the risk of burning your hand in the process.	Gather your ingredients.Ingredients for candles may be purchased at arts and crafts store. Place wax in a double-boiler and heat to 185 degrees.A double boiler or hot plate will suffice while heating your wax. Introduce dye chips while heating.Dye chips will give your candles a pleasant colour. Heat the wax.

Run a couple gallons of lukewarm water into a sink or bucket. Since you’ll be working with bleach, you’ll need a higher concentration of water than you would when cleaning with vinegar. Make sure there’s nothing in your work area that might be damaged by spilled bleach.   Bleach will need to be used to clean humidifier filters with extensive mold or mildewing.Avoid using hot water, as steam can cause the release of bleach fumes., You’ll only need to use about a teaspoon of bleach for every gallon of water. This will sufficiently dilute the bleach so that it can be used as an effective yet non-harmful cleaning agent. Be careful not to overdo it—too much bleach may eat right through a plastic filter.When handling bleach, always wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. If possible, equip a respirator and eye protection.Avoid coming into contact with the bleach solution with bare skin.  Dunk the dirty filter into the solution and make sure it’s fully submerged. Bleach has potent cleaning and sterilizing properties, so no scrubbing is necessary. After a short soak, your humidifier filter will look as good as new.If there’s any mold, mildew or mineral deposits remaining after the initial soak, mix up a fresh batch of solution and soak the filter for another 10 minutes., Carefully remove the now-clean filter from the bleach solution and rinse it under warm water. Turn the filter slowly and aim the stream so that it flows through the filter from every angle. This will ensure that it comes out free of both mold and bleach. Air dry the filter, then return it to the humidifier.You can also make sure the filter has been properly rinsed by swishing it through a sinkful of clean water. It’s important that you wash away every remaining trace of bleach, or it could be released into the air when you operate your humidifier again.	Fill a large container with water. Add a splash of bleach. Soak the filter in the diluted bleach for 10 minutes. Rinse and dry the filter.
Very often when you make a mixtape for a parent or other older relative, it is intended to be a way for them to sample new music. If you're going to show them a lot of new music, spend some time trying to guess whether or not they'll actually enjoy listening to any of it first. Remember, this person has very different musical tastes than you do.  For this kind of mixtape, pick the catchiest and most accessible songs you can think of within the confines of whatever type of music you're planning to give away.   Use your past as a guide. If you can't figure out which tracks those might be, think back to the first time you heard the albums in question. What tracks immediately caught your attention? Even if you've moved on from them now, those are the tracks most likely to make a good impression on people who haven't heard the music before.	Hear with the recipient's ears. Pick your tracks based on what you think they will like.
You don't need much, only a basket or two to hold them in and gloves so your hands don't get all juicy! I wouldn't recommend picking in rainy weather as the raspberries can get squashed and liquidy.; , If you go out just hoping to come across a patch of them then you are wrong! You have to plan ahead and find somewhere close to you. Otherwise, it's a wasted journey and a waste of petrol! However, if you have in your own garden, then pick away!  , Raspberries can be harvested all the way from mid-summer through to the first frost. The fruit is ripe when it can be easily be removed from the plant without being squashed. Fruit ripens at different times, so you will be able to harvest raspberries throughout the season. By autumn they have usually gone past it.See "Tips" for more information.  If you are picking black, golden or purple raspberries, look for berries with firm plumpness. If they are almost a neon red they are slightly passed their best so don't pick them.  Do not pick ones that have a hole in them as an insect has probably got there before you. , Raspberries do not store well and spoil quickly after being picked. Brambles and blackberries are picked in the same way so keep that in mind if you have a bush or two of them! Read how to store raspberries for advice on how to keep them fresh for up to 6 days.	Make sure you are prepared for the picking. Find your area you are going to pick in. Harvest at the right time. Select only the bright red berries. Find the best ones to pick. Hold carefully between the thumb and forefinger and pull: , Use quickly.
For this step, you'll need twelve pieces of wood that are cut to 240 mm and six pieces of wood cut to 248 mm, all about 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch for the height. Use a handsaw to cut the pieces.   Make sure that the width and height of all 18 pieces of wood are exactly the same. Try to purchase wood sticks that are already pre-cut to be 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high. That way you'll only need to worry about cutting the length.; , You'll need to cut 12 pieces at 50 mm each, with the same other dimensions as the other pieces (1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high).  In order to removed the jagged edges left from cutting the wood, you'll need to lightly sand the edges with some sandpaper.  To achieve the beautiful two-tone look, you'll need to stain half of the pieces of wood (of all sizes). So, separate each size of the wood pieces into two sections and apply wood stain to one group.   Choose any wood stain color you like, as long as it contrasts with the existing wood color. Apply the stain generously and wipe off the excess with a paper towel or rag. You need to cover the surface area of both sides and the ends, but don't worry about getting all of the 1/4 inch side because these sides will be glued together. Let the stain dry completely (at least 4 hours) until you move on to the next step.  Take the six pieces of wood that were cut to 248 mm and line them up. Each side of the jewelry box will be made out of three of the six pieces.   Use wood glue to glue the pieces together lengthwise into two three-piece sections, making sure you alternate between the stained and unstained pieces to achieve the two-tone look. Wipe off any excess glue that leaks up between the cracks. Make sure the ends are lined up perfectly and then let the glue dry. You can clamp the pieces into place for a more secure, tight seal if you would like. To avoid gluing the wood to whatever surface you're working on, it might be helpful to lay down a piece of clear Saran wrap to work on.  Alternating between stained and unstained pieces, line up six of the 240 mm pieces of wood on the Saran wrap to make the base. Glue the pieces together, but instead of lining up the ends, alternate them by 1/4 inch (so that the end pieces will fit inside the gaps).  Line up the short end pieces that you cut (the 50 mm pieces), alternating stained and unstained pieces, on each end of the base. Each end will be six pieces long.   Because of how you off-set the edges of the base, one piece will sit on the table and be flush with the base, while the next piece will sit on top of the base, and so on.  Glue the sides of the jewelry box to the frame that you've made (out of the base and the ends). Let the frame dry fully before you move on.   You can use some pieces of wood cut to fit the inside of the box to help the frame maintain its shape while it's drying.  Apply a small coat of Vaseline to the off-set end pieces (the 50 mm pieces) to keep the lid from sticking to the frame with the excess glue when you glue it together.  Glue the remaining six 240 mm pieces of wood to each other in place on top of the frame. As before, make sure to alternate between stained and unstained pieces. The pieces will fit into the existing slots made by the alternating off-set end pieces.   Once all pieces are in place, you will have a perfect rectangular box.  To help the jewelry box dry in the right shape, clamp the box on two sides with two hand clamps. Once the glue is dry, your jewelry box is finished.	Measure and cut the wood for the top, bottom, and sides of the jewelry box. Measure and cut the wood for the ends of the jewelry box. Sand the cut edges. Stain the wood. Make the sides. Make the base. Make the ends. Attach the sides. Use Vaseline to keep the lid from sticking. Make the top lid. Clamp the box to dry.
As with germinating clematis’ from seeds, propagating clematis from cuttings requires quite a bit of preparation and the proper materials. You’ll need a very sharp knife or pair of gardening shears, horticultural disinfectant, 6-inch planters, disinfected potting mixture, fungicide mix, rooting hormone powder, plastic bags, and straws/stakes of some sort to create mini ‘greenhouses’. Begin by using your disinfectant to clean your knife/shears, planting pots, and the stakes/straws you are using.  Use your knife or gardening shears to make a single clean cut through an existing clematis plant. Cut a vine/branch that is at least 3-feet long, severing the plant just above a set of leaves and below the next node up on the stem. If you can, try to take your cutting from the center of the vine rather than the base or the tip, as this has the highest likelihood of sprouting. Continue to separate your cutting out into smaller sections for planting, by cutting just above a leaf node.  If you want your cuttings to sprout, it is imperative that you very carefully follow the directions for using your fungicide and rooting hormone mixtures. Start by dunking each of your cuttings in the fungicide mixture, following the directions that came with the mix. Then, dip the ends of each cutting in the rooting hormone mix, being careful to get just the right amount. Adding too much of the rooting hormones can prevent growth, which is not what you want. Finish by cutting one leaf off each stem; this will reduce moisture loss.  Fill each of your pots with your sterile soil mixture so that they are about ¾ of the way full. Bury the tips of each of the cuttings so that the joint of the leaves are level with the topsoil. Give them a light watering so the soil is damp, and label the pot if applicable.  Clematis cuttings will thrive in a slightly humid environment, which you can easily create with a few household materials. Stick 3-4 straight straws or bamboo stakes into each container, and place a plastic bag over the top. Make sure that the bag is not touching the plant at all, and give the soil a good watering. Once a day, flip the bag inside out to let excess moisture out and to prevent rotting.  It will take 6-8 weeks for your cuttings to start growing, and in the meantime they should be placed under the best growing conditions possible. Relocate the potted plants to a place that has plenty of ambient sunlight, but is mainly shaded, with a temperature between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C).   Too much direct sunlight can overheat the young plants, especially under their plastic bags.  Although your cuttings may sprout in 6-8 weeks, they likely won’t be ready to be planted outdoors for about a year. During this time, water them regularly so that the soil is kept moist at all times, and continue removing and replacing your plastic bag ‘greenhouse’ to keep the humidity up.	Prepare your supplies. Take your cutting. Carefully prepare your cuttings for planting. Plant your cuttings. Increase the humidity. Move the cuttings to the best location. Maintain your cuttings.
Before your kid gets behind the wheel, your teen will be watching you drive; even if you don't realize it. Once the child has an image in their head of how the parents drive they'll start to model the same behavior. So if you've got any bad habits like running red lights, rolling through stop signs, or speeding, this would be the time to stop. Most parents don't find their own bad habits stressful but find it drives them crazy their teen does the same thing. Once they start repeating your bad habits, and you ask them to stop, they're probably going to say "but mom/dad, you do it." So the easiest way to avoid this and stay sane is: just don't do them.; , Many people are "unconsciously competent" when they drive; they do it without thinking about it. But if you have no conscious idea of what you're doing behind the wheel, how are you going to explain it to your teen when they ask what they should do? When you're driving around, make little "mental notes" about when you start braking, how fast you're driving in different situations, and where you're looking. When you have an idea of when, where, and what you're doing on the road, it's easier to recognize mistakes that your teen makes as early as possible. Which gives you both more time to deal with the road ahead.  Driving with your kids is not going to be perfect all the time. Especially in the beginning things are going to be rocky. But there is hope. Research has shown that if we have as little as 10 seconds notice before something bad happens, we'll start to come up with coping strategies that make us feel less stressed out.{{fact} For example: if you're approaching a turn onto a side street, ask yourself "how could this go wrong?" Biggest problem in this type of situation is driving too fast, so you decide on an "if-then" scenario. "If" my kid is going over 20kph/12mph within a few moments of starting the turn, "then" I'll hold the wheel and tell them to keep driving straight. Practice mentally going through different "if-then" scenarios to feel ready for anything (and preserve your sanity) on the road.  Some people hate the idea of having these, but learn to LOVE that people know your kid is learning. It can put your mind at ease and help you stay calm when you know that other drivers will attribute mistakes to someone learning rather than being a bad driver. You can get your own signs made at many sign shops, order them online, tape a handwritten note in the back window or use a government issued "L" (learner) sign.	Pay Attention to Your Own Bad Habits. Be Aware of What You're Doing and How You're Doing It!, Get Emotionally Bulletproof for Your Kids Mistakes. Use Student Driver Signs.
Is it your average point-and-shoot pocket camera? If so, there's a chance it will be allowed inside. Check before taking measures to sneak it in.; , Most cameras now are going for a thin feel and look, and this works to your advantage. Fatter cameras are generally not as tall; use the dimensions to help you feel out places it can go.  It can be in a pocket, purse, concealed in clothing or strapped to your body. Here are a few methods.   Wear a large, baggy sweatshirt with nothing underneath (this is particularly effective if you are female).Use your camera's strap or strap from somewhere else to sling it over your shoulder. Secure it so it hangs right in the pit of your back where it curves in before your buttocks. Put your sweatshirt on over it. If the guards ask you to remove your sweatshirt, lift the front up a bit to show them that you can't, as you have nothing on underneath. Take your purse (or the purse of a female accompanying you, if you are male). Either cut out the lining on the bottom, or find material like it and cut a piece that fits. Lift it and place your camera in the bottom. Fill the remaining space with soft material, both to protect your camera and solidify the bottom again. Replace the lining. Throw some tampons on top. Most bouncers will not dig around very thoroughly. Wear a somewhat baggy long sleeve shirt. If your camera is small enough, strap it with some tape or a strap to your underarm. Be warned, if you are going to an establishment with a gun threat, you are likely to be frisked and this is easily found through touch. Crotch it. Similar to the underarm technique, wear baggy pants and strap it to your inner thigh, very close to your private area. There's a very good chance you won't be searched thoroughly here. If you are a female, wear a mid-length fluffy skirt. Not only will you not be touched there, a skirt looks open enough to allay suspicion, though it conceals very well. You can also unbutton your pants, hang your camera from your button, and then re-button your pants. Then simply slip the camera down into your pants and let it hang. It may be uncomfortable,but holds your camera securely and you don't have to worry about it being found, even if you're frisked. If you have a small and thin wallet, empty most of your wallet and tape it to the inside of the wallet. Keep your wallet in a large pocket and if frisked, when they ask what's in your pocket, immediately say its just your wallet. If you do this you should get in fine. If you're using a professional grade camera with a lens, this may work for you. You'll need a friend. Take your camera, a separate body you won't be shooting with, and two lenses. Have your friend conceal one lens well and one lens very conspicuously, so that it will be found with a simple search. Do the same with your two camera bodies. Have your friend go first. When the lens is found, have them give it up obligingly and apologize to you, where you will step up, possibly curse or look abashed, and hand over your dummy camera body. These will be tagged for pickup after the show, and it is unlikely they will search you for a second camera. The same can be done with small pocket cameras. Conceal your real one well, and then use a disposable or cheap other camera as your dummy. Ladies: Fluff and tease your hair up to a nice volume. Get a poofy sort of hat, like the ones Britney Spears is fond of. Pull some of your hair into a poof on top of your head, and conceal your camera inside. Top it off with your big hat and you're good to go. This is also easily reversed once inside, so you don't have to walk around with bad hair. Security may ask you to remove your hat though, counteracting this technique. Use your gloves. Get one pair of gloves, and a third of the same or a similar type. Place your camera inside one glove, and wear the other two. When in line, place your camera glove someplace inconspicuous but where you might set your gloves normally. When in plain sight of a bouncer, or right before being searched, obviously take your gloves off and place them on top of the third, then pick them up in one hand or set them on the table with your jacket and umbrella, or something of the sort. Then when you have been searched, pick up your gloves, tip your hat, and enjoy the show.  I doubt that the guard would ask you to take off your shoes. When in there, go into the bathroom and take the camera out of your shoe; put the camera in one of your pockets or any other easily-accessible area and enjoy the show.  Go through the whole process with the guard and get in. During the concert, play, show, etc. rip open the seam and take out the camera.  Be apologetic and act ignorant.  if the guard asks to see your bag give it to them most guards don't check in the hoodie. Put in some cash, a phone, etc. to make it look inconspicuous.	Examine your camera. Check its size. Find a place to put your camera. If your camera is strong and thin enough, put your camera in your shoe. Wear an old jacket and carve a little seam in it(make sure it's on the inside of the coat so nobody sees it), the size of a camera will do it and tape it up or sew it up. Once inside, if you get caught, do not make a fuss or a scene, your camera, film, memory card, and tickets may all be subject to confiscation. Take a cinch bag and a hoodie, wrap you camera into your hoodie and put the hoodie in you bag. Finished.
If you're using medical tape to keep gauze or other protective wrapping on your body, it helps to gently wet the edges of the tape to make it easier to remove. The water will help dampen the tape and make it easier for it to come off. Then, slowly pick at the tape while it's in the water until it eventually peels off.          Don't soak a serious wound in water to help get the tape off. It's usually important to keep wounds as dry as possible as you're trying to heal them, making it important that you only use a small amount of water to help ease off medical tape.  Gradual pulling makes it a lot more painful. Instead, dab it gently with water and pull it off as quickly as possible. One second of quick pain is better than ten seconds of wincing and whimpering while you carefully rip it. Plus, the soapy water should help to soften it and remove it much more quickly.  Carefully lift up a small piece of the tape, dabbing a cotton ball in a little Vaseline, then wiping a little under the lifted piece of tape to help soften the adhesive. Slowly lift up more of the tape using the cotton bud and more vaseline. Continue doing until all the tape is removed.  Medical tape will often leave some gunk stuck to your skin and your hairs, and the best way to remove it is by rubbing it vigorously with warm soapy water. Stay clear of the wound, if there is one, or leave the wound covered while you clean up the area affected by the tape.	Wet the edges of medical tape. Remove the tape quickly. If it's especially painful, use a small amount of Vaseline. Clean up the remaining residue.
Graduation caps have tassels that often come in a separate plastic bag from the gown and are not already on the mortarboard, which is the official name for the flat graduation cap.Shake the tassel in order to untangle any of its strands before you try to fasten it to the cap. This will make the process easier. The mortarboard earned its name because it was said to resemble tools used by masons to hold mortar. These graduation caps, including tassels, were first worn by artists and students in the 14th century and being able to wear one indicated intelligence and power.; , You can figure out the front of the cap by looking on the cap’s inside. There will be writing that says “front of cap.”   Graduation caps usually have a square, flat top. They sit on the top of a skull cap that should be form-fitting around your head. The tassel goes on top of the cap. Make sure you wear the cap correctly also. Mortarboard graduation caps should be worn so the cap’s front tip is centered on your forehead, right between your eyes. The hat shouldn’t be tilted off your head. Put it directly on your head’s top., Most tassels have two strings that form into a loop at the end to affix them to the button on the top of the graduation cap.Place the center of the loop end of the tassel over the button at the top of the cap with the tassel toward the front of the cap. To do so, you must bend the loop in half and start passing the tassel side of the loop through the loop end. This will create a hole which the button can be placed through and when the tassel is then pulled tight, it will be securely held on the cap's button by friction and gravity. Gently tug both sides of the loop under the button edge to lock it into place. Criss cross your loop under the button, and pull until you hear it snap.  This is probably not necessary, but some people want a little more security around their tassel.   You could use a drop of glue on the end of the tassel before fastening it to the button. You could also use adhesive tape for the same purpose. Basically, you are sliding the loop at the top of the tassel onto the button at the center of the top of your mortarboard. Tug gently on the tassel to make sure it's firmly seated under the button. The glue or adhesive is just extra support.  Once, you are declared a graduate, flip it to the left side. Flipping the tassel is called “turning the tassel.”   If you want to keep the tassel as a treasure before you toss your cap, you can quickly remove it and tuck it in your pocket for safe keeping and pictures later. Don’t flip your tassel until you actually are handed your diploma on the commencement stage. Although the mortarboard is very old, turning the tassel is a tradition that only dates back about 40 years.  The rules are different if you’re not an undergraduate or high school student.   If you are getting a graduate degree (like a master’s degree or PHD), you will want to wear your tassel on the left side throughout the graduation ceremonies. Fastening the tassel works the same way no matter what the degree level, though.  You will need a button on the top of the hat so that you have something to loop the tassel around.   Fasten the tassel as you would do to a graduation hat, by looping the tassel around the hat’s button and securing it by criss crossing it around the button. You could fasten the tassel to the button by using a slipknot. To make a slipknot, hold the yarn with two hands. Create a loop by bring the yarn in your right hand under the yarn in the left hand, so the bottom of the yarn crosses. Secure the yarn at the crossing point. Reach through the loop, and grab the yarn on the left side. Pull the right hand back through with the yarn. Grab the two hanging ends and the loop, and pull them in opposite directions.  Sometimes people want to put a yarn tassel on a crocheted hat (or other piece of knitted work like a shawl).   Make the tassel separately, rather than crocheting it directly into the hat. You will want to attach the tassel to the hat after you finish the hat. Cut a piece of cardboard that is the width of the tassel length you want. You may need a different size of cardboard if you are working off a pattern. In such a case, follow the directions.  Take yarn, and wrap it around the cardboard. The more you wrap it, the fuller the ultimate tassel will become. You could also wind the yarn around something else, like a videogame or CD jacket. Wind it around loosely. Now, take a separate piece of yarn, and use it to tie the yarn bundle together at one end. You want this piece to be at least 6 inches long because you will also need it to tie the tassel to the hat. Slide the yarn carefully off the cardboard. You want a loop at the end of the yarn. Take another piece of yarn, and tie it around the bundle of yarn below the already tied end. Knot it.  You want to cut the loops off on the opposite end of the bundle that is tied, and trim the ends to make sure they are even.Now attach the tassel to the hat. You could use a crewel needle to stitch the tassel to the hat. Weave the end of the yard into the hat’s stitches. Thread one end end into the needle, and stitch the tassel and hat together. ,	Remove the tassel from its packaging. Locate the front of the graduation cap. Find the loop end of the tassel. Use a glue gun or other adhesive to better secure the tassel. Put the tassel on the right side of the cap until you graduate if you’re an undergraduate. Wear the tassel on the left if you’re getting a graduate degree. Secure a button to the hat. Put a tassel on a crocheted hat. Complete the yarn tassel. Cut the loops at one end of the tassel. Finished.
Waldo is a cottage industry of his own. In addition to puzzles and the books, you can find online Waldo riddles and games.It works the same way; you are given a complicated photo that includes a sea of people and you're tasked with spotting Waldo. Sometimes you will be given a multiple sentence riddle containing clues as to his location. Waldo is often harder to spot because the illustrator uses colors to fool you. For example, don’t assume he’s in the seas of red you see.  There are Waldo apps you can download on the Android and iOS smartphones. The newest apps are free.The plot involves a twister that has torn through the countryside, and you must locate Waldo and other hidden objects that the twister has scattered about, or they will be lost in the sea. Unusual stories accompany each new land. You will use a map to visit each of the lands, and will earn coins as you find the objects in them. The coins are used to unlock new lands. The game is called Waldo & Friends. One downside of it is that it contains ads. The positive is that if you are done with all of the Waldo books, there are plenty of other places you can find Waldo!  , You can increase your chances of finding Waldo in the app with a few quick strategies.Try playing the same scene again and again so you figure out where objects are placed, and you will be able to find them when you play again. When you find an object, don’t tap it right away. If you find more objects nearby and tap them to get combos, you will end up with a higher final score. Save bones for really tough scenarios because you can use them to instantly find an item. Wait until the final star of the game because they’re hard to get.  Look for the colors that stand out in Waldo's clothes, or look for the hat. These items will either be differently colored from the surrounding scenery or will stand out as something out of context.   Watch out for Waldo lookalikes! Often, there will be Waldo impostors in red-and-white striped shirts or glasses, there to trick you into thinking you've found Waldo. Be sure to look closely at the image you find to make sure it's the true Waldo. Look for "extras." Often, scanning for the bonus items on each page, you'll uncover Waldo along the way! It's a two-for-one that can save many valuable minutes in your day.	Look online. Download a Waldo app. Use tricks to find Waldo in the app. Look at the scenery in which Waldo appears.
If possible, use thread that matches the color of your clothing. If the stitch won't be visible from outside the garment, then the color of the thread does not matter. You may also choose to use a vibrantly-colored thread to complement or contrast with the fabric.; , If the fabric is thick and tough (denim, leather, and multi-layered cloth), use a sharp, heavy needle so that you can pierce the cloth without too much effort. If the fabric is soft or thin, you may use any needle – though you might want to use a more delicate needle.Cotton, nylon, silk, jute, mixed fabric, and any other thin, soft fabric is better stitched with a lighter needles. The needle can be as short as 1-2 inches, or longer as needed. If you use a thick needle—approximately 1 mm in thickness—it may leave visible holes in the fabric. You may use a finger cap to prevent being poked by the needle while stitching. Opt for a thicker needle to avoid breaking any needles. Use a solid board to push the needle through while stitching if your finger hurts. Some thick fabrics like denim need pushing against a hard surface.  If unsure, try laying the thread over the torn area for reference. Take about 10 inches more than you think you'll need. The in-and-out sewing motion will take up a lot of thread, and you'll also need a bit more thread than the needle's length in order to tie the final knot. Remember: the thicker the fabric, the more thread you'll need. You may choose to take two times more thread if the fabric is thicker than 5mm.  Make sure that the tip of the thread is tight, not split. If the tip is frayed: wet it, then roll it with your fingers so that it goes easily through the eye of the needle.Try using a needle threader if you have trouble., Hold both ends of the thread. Tie a small knot to keep the far tip (the one that you didn't thread through the eye of the needle) from slipping through the fabric after the needle.   If you intend to make a stitch to a torn knit wear, then you must make a bigger effort. Knit wear or woolen clothes contain much bigger gaps than other fabrics. Here, to begin with, you must make a knot with the threaded needle so that your thread has something holding it in place.	Get a thread roll and a needle. Pick the right needle for the cloth. Make sure that you have enough thread. Thread the needle. Knot the thread.
You will need a good pair of rose gloves and a pair of sharpened bypass pruners.   Rose gloves need to be thick and tall to protect your hands and arms from any thorns growing on the bushes. Bypass pruners cut like scissors do, making them preferable to anvil-type pruners, which have a tendency to crush the stems as they cut. Nice, clean cuts are essential to maintaining the health of the plant. You should also make sure that the pruners are very sharp. Sharp pruners will make cleaner cuts than dull pruners. If you do not have bypass pruners, you could use hedge clippers or trimmers, instead. Whatever you use, though, make sure that the tool can create sharp, clean cuts. If cutting canes larger than 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in diameter, use loppers instead of pruners.; , Regardless of the purpose, time of year, or type of cut you are making, the cut should be made roughly 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) above the leaf bud at an outward angle.   The slant should be away from the bud. Cutting any closer to the bud could shock it, but cutting any further from the bud will leave too much old stem, and the plant will be directing a lot of lost energy to stem that will no longer produce much.  As you prune your roses, you should periodically dip them into a cleaning solution to sanitize them, thereby limiting the risk of spreading disease. This should be done regardless of how much you are pruning and during which season.   A common, all-purpose household cleaner is thought to work best. Alternatively, a solution of 70% rubbing alcohol can be used, instead.	Gather the necessary tools. Cut at an angle. Dip pruners into disinfecting solution.
“Slow toilet” can mean one of two things. Either the bowl isn’t filling quickly, or it isn’t draining quickly. If you’re dealing with the latter, the drain is likely clogged. You’ll need to unclog the toilet. If the bowl isn’t filling quickly enough, you might only need to check the tank.  The tank is the upright portion of the toilet, where you find the flushing handle. Lay the tank cover on the floor carefully; the heavy porcelain can potentially damage your floors., The flapper is a piece of plastic or rubber which sits over the valve at the bottom of the tank. Unless your toilet isn’t flushing at all, there should be a chain connecting this to the trip lever, a small arm running from the flushing handle.The chain should have just enough slack for the flapper to rest over the valve, sealing it. But it should be tight enough to lift the flapper when the flushing handle is used.  Performing this adjustment is rather simple. The chain should run through a hole in the flushing handle. You can easily disconnect the chain, and place a different link through the hole to adjust the chain’s overall length. The chain should be left with about half an inch of slack.Adjusting the chain means you may come into contact with the water in the toilet’s tank. As long as you wash your hands afterwards, this is perfectly safe.	Find the source of the problem. Lift the tank cover. Check the chain connecting the flushing handle to the flapper. Adjust the chain if needed.
Locate sheet music for the fife online or at music stores. Use a fingering chart side by side with the sheet music to remember where to place your fingers for each note.   You may be able to adapt music for another wind instrument—like a flute, piccolo, or panpipe—to play for the fife. Ask music store staff or someone familiar with wind instruments for help with this.  If you can’t or don’t want to read sheet music, you can also learn new songs simply by listening to them and sounding out the notes on your fife through trial and error, one note at a time.   It will get easier to pick out notes once you have a better understanding of your instrument and practice picking up songs by ear. If you get stuck figuring out a note or section of notes, try moving on to a different part of the song., Take deep breaths and move slowly from note to note when you’re figuring out a song. It helps to stand up rather than sit down to play. Hold your head and shoulders up and your chest open to take big deep breaths.   It can be very difficult and awkward at first to move your fingers from note to note. Be patient. Break the music down into small parts (just a few notes at a time), then repeat the same part over and over until you can move your fingers easily to each note before moving onto the next part.  Look up a fife and drum corps in your area. Join one of these groups to team up with other fife players and drummers to learn new songs, get valuable input and experience, and play in parades or historical events.  If you want to find another group to play with, and especially if you’re interested in the rich military history of fife music, talk to war reenactors about playing the fife for their reenactments or other events.  Continue to play just for yourself and improve by learning more from a teacher, an instructional book, or watching videos and looking up music online.	Find sheet music. Play music by ear. Breathe and take it slow. Join a fife and drum corps. Check with war reenactor groups. Keep playing on your own.
In the case of a small pattern, the tacking or pinning may be dispensed with and instead, the two sheets held firmly pressed against the window pane with the left hand, whilst the right hand does the tracing. However, even then it is safer to pin, sticky tack or gum the four corners of the two sheets together. This is especially useful in case of interruption such as the telephone ringing, as it is difficult to fit them together again exactly.  The tracing may be done with a pencil, or, with a gel ink pen or water-colour paint., The process of tracing is easy enough, so long as the hand does not get tired. Depending on how complex and large the pattern, you will become tired, hence the reason why it is best to tack the pattern to the window to take rest periods., Use as required.	Tack or pin the piece of paper on which the copy is to be made onto the pattern.  Take your preferred tracing item.  Commence tracing.  Remove when completed.
Unwrap the curtains if they are still packaged. After that, you should wash your curtains on a cold water delicate cycle and then dry them with low heat or no heat on a gentle cycle. Beyond removing residue from your curtains, washing will also make stubborn wrinkles less difficult.If your curtains are especially dirty, as might be the case if you're swapping in old curtains that have been in storage, you may want to wash them in warm water, but only if the label recommends doing so. Generally, you should wash your curtains in cold water. This will help prevent fading and shrinkage in your curtain fabric. For best results, you should use detergent intended for delicate fabric. With curtains that have dark or prominent colors, you might also want to use detergent formulated to keep colors from fading.If care instructions are included with your curtains, keep these. Some kinds of fabric or styles of curtain may require special treatment. If yours do, this information will be included in the care instructions. If there aren’t care instructions on the packaging or a separate sheet of paper, look for a small tag on your curtain. This should have information like the material your curtains are made of and recommended washing and ironing procedure.; , Much like you've laid your curtains out close to where you intend to hang them, you'll also want your ironing board set up close to the hanging location. This will create less opportunity for wrinkles to form while transporting your curtains between the ironing and hanging location.   If you're having trouble setting up your ironing board, look for a catch or button underneath the board. Many boards have this feature to prevent the legs from extending while you are moving it. You may find it easiest to set up your ironing board in its tallest position to make transferring your curtains from the board to the curtain rod easier., Depending on the age and brand of iron you're using, the time it take to heat up can vary. In many cases, five minutes should be sufficient for your iron to heat up.Then turn your iron’s dial to the appropriate fabric setting.   Most irons have a dial with which you can select a setting for the kind of fabric you'll be ironing. Common fabrics that are likely listed on your iron include cotton, linen, and synthetic fabrics. Check the tag on your curtain or its care instructions to determine the fabric you'll be ironing, and set your iron to that fabric.Never lay your iron so the metal, heated part of the iron rests on your ironing board. This can cause your iron to burn the board.  A little spritz of water to dampen the curtains will help your iron work its magic. Regular water from your faucet should work fine for this purpose, but if you have hard water, you may want to use distilled water to prevent discoloration in your curtains from mineral buildup.Feel free to use the spray feature on irons that have one in place of a spray bottle. However, a spray bottle will come in handy if you have to spot treat wrinkles that form after you iron.  There are many ways you can lay out your curtain, and you may find that some work better for you than others. To prevent missing wrinkles and make hanging the curtain easier on yourself, you may want to work from the top of the curtain down.   You can identify the top of the curtain easily by looking for the curtain rod loops or pockets. When ironing from one end to another, you'll likely need to reposition your curtains several times throughout the process.  If your iron doesn't have a stream or spray feature, take your water bottle and spray the curtain with clean water a few times until it is damp. Pass your iron back and forth over the width of the curtain until wrinkles are smoothed and work your way toward its bottom.It's unlikely you'll be able to iron your entire curtain on your board all at once. As you work farther down the curtain, you can adjust your curtain so that the already ironed top portion hangs off the end of your ironing board. Continue until the ironed portion almost reaches the floor. It's very common for a curtain to wrinkle after ironing. By allowing your ironed curtain to hang loosely off the edge of your ironing board until it almost reaches the floor, it's unlikely bunching or re-wrinkling will occur., Roughly one half to two-thirds of your curtain should be ironed at this point. By hanging the ironed portion of your curtain now, there'll be less of a chance it will wrinkle and you'll still be able to finish the un-ironed part. To do this you should:   Disassemble your curtain rod. Feed the rod through the tabs, pockets, or hanging loops at the top of the curtain. Hang the curtain and rod in place. The remaining un-ironed part of your curtain should hang low enough for you to finish the ironing. If you have a low ironing board, it may be difficult to iron enough curtain to allow the un-ironed remainder to reach your board after hanging so you can finish ironing it. In this case, you may want to bring a stool or something you can drape the ironed part of your curtain over to keep it from wrinkling while finishing the entire curtain. Then you can hang it., As you continue to iron your way toward the bottom of the curtain, you can allow ironed parts to fall into position to hang with the upper ironed portion. Try to avoid sharp angles that causes the fabric to fold or bunch. This could re-wrinkle your curtains.After you've finished, you can spot treat remaining wrinkles. You can do this easily with your spray bottle. Simply spray any remaining wrinkles with water, smooth the fabric with your hands, and let it dry. This technique works well for removing light wrinkles., Delicate, embellished fabrics can be damaged from the heat of your iron. However, for most unembellished curtains, you shouldn't need to do anything special to iron out wrinkles.   To protect delicate fabrics and embellishments, you can overlay a pillowcase or sheet over the embellished area you'll be ironing to protect it from direct heat, and then iron as normal. If you're concerned that the heat setting for your iron may be too high, a pillowcase/sheet buffer is also a good idea., Many curtains will not require starch, though easily wrinkled delicate fabrics may call for it. Starch will make your fabric crisp and less wrinkle prone. Your curtain instructions should indicate if a starch solution should be used on your curtains.Many modern forms of starch come premixed in a spray can. For this kind of starch product, you should follow the directions as indicated on its label. Some starch comes in powdered form and is intended to be mixed with clean water in a spray bottle. You can make your own starch spray with one heaping tablespoon of corn starch and one pint of clean water. Mix the solution well before using., With especially delicate or expensive curtains, your pillowcase/sheet heat buffer might not be enough to fully protect your curtains. You can still iron your curtains safely by using your pad and ironing the back of the curtain rather than the front., These kind of fabrics are especially prone to heat damage. When ironing these, you'll be sure to want buffer fabric, like a pillowcase or sheet, in between the iron and the curtain fabric. For extreme wrinkles, spray the curtain fabric with water first, put your buffer fabric in place, and then iron.  Gather pleats together and iron them down in a way that follows the design of the fabric. This will make the accent of the pleat look crisper and more sharply defined.   A spritz of water from your spray bottle can help your iron remove stubborn wrinkles in the pleating.	Wash the curtains. Set up your ironing board. Set up your iron. Prepare your spray bottle. Lay out your first curtain segment on your ironing board. Iron across the width. Hang your segment of curtain. Finish the curtains. Evaluate your curtain fabric. Use starch when recommended. Iron the back of the curtain for further heat protection. Take extra care with silk or satin curtains. Iron pleats to make them more pronounced.
Use windshield cleaner to clean the inside and outside of your windshield at least once a month. If you know you are about to drive for a lengthy period at night, make sure to clean your windshield beforehand as well.Alternatively, you can use a mixture of water, dishwashing detergent and vinegar to clean your windshield. Mix six cups (1,400 ml) of water, a tablespoon (30 ml) of detergent and a cup (240 ml) of vinegar together until well-combined. Fill a spray bottle with the mixture and use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe your windshield clean.; , Clean your side mirrors and windows once a month, or as they become dirty. You can use the detergent-vinegar solution to clean these as well. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth. Wipe the inside and outside of your windows clean, as well as the surfaces of your outside mirrors.To avoid streaks, make sure to dry your windows and side mirrors with a clean microfiber cloth afterwards.  You can use toothpaste to do this. Wet your headlights with a damp cloth. Apply a tablespoon (30 ml) of toothpaste to each headlight. Using the damp cloth, scrub the toothpaste over the entire surface. Scrub for one minute, focusing on dirty areas. Then rinse the headlights with water and dry them with a clean microfiber cloth.If the toothpaste method does not work, then you may need to get your headlights professionally buffed and cleaned.	Clean your windshield. Make sure your mirrors and windows are clean. Clean your headlights.
Before you can do a thorough job of cleaning out the vehicle’s interior, you’ll need to remove any loose trash from the cabin. If you have personal items like blankets, spare pairs of shoes or the like, you should remove them as well.Use a trash bag to collect scraps, loose wrappers, or any other trash from the floor, seats or ashtrays in the vehicle. Collect your personal items and set them aside to bring inside. Don’t forget to clean any trash or personal items out of the trunk as well.; , Either use a shop vacuum with a long hose or take your vehicle to an automotive vacuum center. Be sure to vacuum all of the carpeted surfaces in the vehicle, including the trunk and beneath the seats.If you take your vehicle to an automotive vacuum center (usually located with car washes) you will likely need quarters to pay for the vacuum. Keep an eye out for stains in the carpet you’ll need to address as you vacuum.  Use an automotive interior cleaner to wipe down all plastic trim components in the interior of your vehicle. If you don’t have automotive cleaner, an all purpose cleaner will also suffice for wiping away dust or any stuck on grime.Don’t use all purpose or interior cleaner on leather. Make sure to wipe in the nooks and crannies of the dashboard where dust tends to collect. You can purchase interior cleaners at most automotive and large retail stores.  Use a cleaner designed specifically for use on leather when cleaning leather seats or upholstery inserts. This will prolong the life of the leather and prevent it from cracking.They make spray-on leather cleaner as well as pre-moistened wipes you can use to simply wipe the seats and trip components down. If you wish, you may also use a leather treater after cleaning the leather. This will condition the leather deeper and help it maintain its softness and shine longer.  Use a glass cleaner to spray and wipe down all of the glass surfaces on the interior of the vehicle, including the inside of the windshield and the rear view mirror. Pay close attention to wipe away any streaks or fingerprints.You should wash the exterior of the windows with glass cleaner after washing the car to ensure there are no water spots.  If there are any stains in the seats or carpets that need to be addressed you can use either a spot-stain remover or a small carpet shampooer. Prior to using a stain remover on the stain, test it in an inconspicuous area to ensure the stain remover will not negatively affect the dye in the material.After you’ve tested your stain removal method, scrub it into any stains on the carpet or seats. Follow the directions for how long to leave it on the stain and how to properly wipe it away to remove the stain completely.  Engine degreaser works best on a warm application. Start the vehicle and allow it to run for a few minutes to bring up the temperature of the engine block and other components. This will make removing stuck on grime significantly easier.Don’t leave the engine running for too long or it may get too hot to touch.  Use a hand or socket wrench of the appropriate size to loosen the nut holding the negative cable onto the battery terminal. Slide the cable off and tuck it down to the side of the battery. Then use some plastic bags and tape to cover the battery and any other loose bits of wiring you see in the engine compartment.While the engine likely won’t suffer any issues from getting wet, it’s better to protect electronics that could feasibly arc when reconnected. If there are any aftermarket wires in your engine bay for things like external amplifiers or subwoofers, make sure they are covered.  Spray the engine degreaser directly onto the metal portions of the engine and cylinder head. If some of it over-sprays onto plastic components that’s all right, but try to avoid getting it on painted surfaces as it may damage paint.Read the instructions on the specific type of engine degreaser you purchased to know how long to let it sit. The longer you let the degreaser set (within reason) the deeper it will clean.  Use a stiff bristled brush to scrub large deposits of stuck on dirt or grime in your engine while the degreaser works. It should loosen the grime, allowing you to remove it with the brush. Be extremely careful not to burn yourself or breath the fumes in too deeply.It’s best to use engine degreaser in open, well ventilated areas. Remember that the engine is hot, so avoid touching it directly with your hands.  Use a hose to rinse the engine degreaser and all of the grime off of the engine. After you finish rinsing it, look around for areas that you may need to apply degreaser to again. Repeat the process if necessary.If certain parts of the engine are still dirty, apply the degreaser again and repeat the process. Plastic that still looks dirty can be cleaned with an all-purpose cleaner.  Before washing the body of the car, apply tire and wheel cleaners to your tires and rims. You may choose to buy a combination tire and wheel cleaner to minimize the steps, or you may choose to purchase cleaners for each portion of the wheel. Allow the cleaner to set for a while and scrub away brake dust or stuck on grime with a soft bristled brush and a rag.Make sure to use a sponge or rag that you do not intend to use washing the body of the vehicle. Allow the cleaner to sit for a few minutes on the wheels and tires before spraying them off.  Use a hose to rinse the wheel and tire cleaners off, then rinse the rest of the car in its entirety. If there are any leaves or other debris on the car, you may want to remove them by hand before continuing to rinse the body.A lot of the dirt and road sludge should come off of the car as you rinse it. A high pressure nozzle will help get more of the tough to clean dirt off of the vehicle.  Fill a bucket with water and a bit of automotive soap. Soak a clean sponge in the soapy water and use it to begin washing the top of the body of the vehicle. Walk all the way around the vehicle cleaning the high portions of the body before moving lower.If it is a very large vehicle, you may choose to wash only sections, such as the front of the vehicle, at a time. Don’t apply soapy water to a vehicle in direct sunlight or it may dry onto the paint.  Once you have washed the entire body of the vehicle, rinse it thoroughly to ensure no soap can remain and dry on the paint. Just as you did with soaping it up, start rinsing at the top and ensure all the soap has been washed away before moving lower.Soap can dry onto paint, causing it to look duller. Removing dried soap can remove wax and even damage clearcoat.  You can use a towel to dry the vehicle, or you may choose to allow it to air dry. Once the vehicle is dry, use the applicator sponge that comes with automotive wax to apply a fresh coat to the painted metal portions of the exterior of your vehicle.Even if you use a towel, you will need to wait until the water dries in the small crevices all around the vehicle before you wax. Apply the wax to the entire body of the vehicle, then give it time to dry.  Most automotive wax will turn a white, chalky color upon drying enough to be buffed off. Check by touching the wax with your index finger. If it rubs away beneath your finger without you having to apply much pressure, it’s ready to be buffed off. Use a chamois towel and wipe the wax away in circular motions to reveal shiny paint beneath.If your chamois towel gets dirty, swap it out for another one. You don’t want to buff dirty into the new wax.	Clean out trash and personal items. Vacuum the carpets. Wipe down plastic surfaces with interior cleaner. Use leather cleaner on leather parts. Wipe down interior and exterior glass. Use a carpet shampooer or stain remover if necessary. Warm the engine up for five minutes. Disconnect the battery and cover exposed wiring. Apply engine degreaser. Use a brush to scrub stuck on grime. Rinse the engine with a hose. Apply wheel and tire cleaner. Rinse the car with clean water. Use a sponge and soapy water to clean the body. Rinse the entire vehicle. Once the vehicle is dry, apply a coat of wax. Buff the wax off once it dries.
,  Find a stud or a joist if you plan to hang your bike from the ceiling. To do this, you can either get a stud finder or, if your ceiling walls are finished, look for a line of nail heads through the paneling or drywall.       Measure to decide where your mounting hardware will attach to the wall. If you have a helper, have this person hold the bike where you want it to hang so that you can mark where the mounting screws will go.       Pre-drill holes for the mounting screws. Make sure the holes go into the middle of the stud or joist. Use larger screws screws (~2 inch, #10) for a ceiling mounted hook than for a wall mounted hook.       Attach the mounting hardware and try it out. Hang and retrieve the bike several times to make sure it works as you intended. Note: This step is particularly important for children to try, because you must make sure they are able to hang and retrieve their bikes.	Visit a bike shop, hardware or home improvement store to purchase the necessary materials.  , Install your hardware.
Even if you know the story like the back of your hand, you still need to write it down. Include every detail you'd like to include in the song. This step sounds simple but once you start becomes very difficult when you try to include everything. Keep it short enough to turn into lyrics unless you plan on writing a hip hop ballad.; , Underline the details that correspond to the important parts. Take out all the unimportant bits that won't be going into the song, and then rewrite it onto another sheet of paper if you'd like, to keep it clean.  Make sure it rhymes, and put each stanza together so that it forms one long poem. These will be the verses to your song, since they tell the story well.  This is a little harder, since the chorus usually doesn't tell a story- it basically sums it up. Stop and think: what is the main feeling you want the story to give? If it's a happy song about something encouraging, try to write a stanza describing that happiness. If it tells the story of a break up, make the chorus a reflection of the feelings you had going through the break up.  A pre-chorus is just a short couple of lines that comes before the chorus but isn't actually part of the chorus. An example of a pre-chorus would be in Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me," when she sings "she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts, she's cheer captain..." until it reaches the chorus. This step is optional.  Generally this is only 1-2 lines that repeat over a few times towards the end of the song. The bridge doesn't have to have anything to do with the chorus- you could make it focus on a certain part of the story, or the entire story at once.  Figure out the order in which you're going to put the verses and the chorus. A popular form is Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Bridge, Verse, Chorus.  Now that you have the actual lyrics, put them to a tune or ask someone else to write one for you if you struggle with it. Once you have a tune, you can sing your very own song and share it with others! Congratulations- you have just written your very own hip hop song based on a story!	Write out your story. Take a highlighter and highlight the 2-4 most important parts. Write one stanza (usually 4-6 lines) for each main detail of the story. The next step is to think of the chorus. Write out a pre-chorus if you feel the song needs one. Write the bridge to the song. Decide on a song format. Write a catchy tune!
If you are going to include items that need to sit at the bottom of the bucket (like a tree branch, etc.) make room so that you can fit the piece on the bottom.  If you have large, protruding items, add them first to the bucket and then you can build around them.  For example, if you include a few protruding birch tree branches, surround the branches with pine cones and embed small twinkling lights around the pine cones to add sparkle.  The smallest, special touches should be added after your structure has been created. This includes touches of glitter, lights or small berries.	Fill the bucket with newspaper or filler so that your items will sit at the top of the bucket and on display. Add longest/largest piece first and then work around that focal point. Build natural items around each other and add touches of holiday magic. Add final touches after the basic elements are in place.
Get the stuff that you need. This will be included at the "Things You'll Need" section of this article.; , Make sure that everything is well away of the fire-prone places, such as dryers and chimneys. It is recommended that you add a screen at the fireplace in the family room to prevent chimney fire. Make sure that you throw out the dust filter that filters the clothes in your dryer. You should do this monthly, or after 10 sets of clothes. Also check to see if any pipelines that connect the dryer aren't clogged. If you do find a clot, do not use the dryer, and call a plumber. If you need to dry clothes, dry them on a clothes-hanger outside at your deck.  Make sure that you have 2 exits out of your house when the fire comes. Discuss with your family on where to go from every room that is frequently used (e.g. Bathroom). Sound an alarm to do some drills with your family, and that you are confident with it.	Prepare. Check. Do some drills.
There are two general methods of propagating zucchini - either by planting seeds, or by purchasing a small pre-existing zucchini plant and transplanting it to your garden. If you choose to grow your zucchini from seeds, you’ll have to start your seeds 4-6 weeks prior to the planting time outdoors for your environment/location. Grabbing a pre-potted plant is always easier and less time-consuming, but may not be as fulfilling as starting your zucchini from seeds.   There are a few kinds of zucchini, but the squash are all generally the same. You might see zucchini as classified as ‘open habit’ or ‘dense habit’, which refers to the way the leaves grow on the bush (sprawling/vine-y or bush-like). Most bush varieties of zucchini are considered summer squash, while vine varieties are considered winter squash. Zucchini will vary naturally between a yellow-ish hue and a green so dark it is nearly black. Some have very mild stripes/spots, this is normal and should not be concerning.; , Zucchini is typically considered a summer squash, because it thrives and produces the best fruit in summer. Some varieties are considered winter squashes, but this has to do with the time of fruiting, rather than the time of planting. Zucchini are sun loving and won’t do well in cold soil. Therefore, plant your zucchini when the temperature of the soil outdoors is at least 55 °F (13 °C). This is normally after the first or second week of spring, after all chance of frost have passed.If you’re not sure when to plant, call your local agricultural extension for detailed information on planting times for zucchini in your area.  Zucchini will thrive in an area that gets full sunlight with plenty of room to spread out. Find a location in your garden that will supply the zucchini with at least 6-10 hours of sunlight per day, and that lacks too much shade. Be sure to select a plot that has well draining soil; zucchini like moist soil, but not soggy soil.   If necessary, improve drainage by planting the zucchini on soil mounds, or through larger changes such as soil amendment and drainage systems. Plant in an area with southern exposure for maximum sun (or northern exposure in the Southern Hemisphere).  Although not everyone has the time to, preparing soil several months in advance will allow for the best growing conditions for your zucchini. Start by mixing in a gardening mulch and fertilizer, to supply the soil with the necessary nutrients. Test the soil pH, and amend it if necessary; zucchini prefer a soil environment with a pH between 6 and 7.5. To make the soil more acidic (lower pH), mix in peat moss or pine needles. To make the soil more alkaline (higher pH), mix in lime.To add nutrients and organic material, till compost into the soil a month before planting, then cover with mulch until time to plant. If your soil does not drain well, mix in some sand to help encourage water drainage.  If you’d rather not take chances of sowing your seeds directly into the soil, you can start your zucchini seeds indoors 4-6 weeks prior to transplanting them outdoors. Grab seed trays, soil-less potting mixture, and your seeds. Place a single seed in each tray, cover with ⅛ inch of potting mixture, and water well! These should be placed in an area that gets sunlight and is at least 60 °F (16 °C). When the second set of leaves have sprouted, the zucchini starts are ready to be transplanted outdoors.  Use a gardening trowel to dig a small hole for your zucchini plant. If you’re planting seeds, you’ll need to stick each seed less than ½-inch under the soil. For zucchini starts, dig each hole to be slightly larger than the root ball on your plant. Keep 75–100 centimeter (39.4 in) space between each plant (same distance for row space). You can thin out seedlings if needed.  Place each zucchini seed or start into its own individual hole. Cover seeds with ¼ or ½ inch of soil, so that they are able to get the necessary sunlight and water for germinating. Cover up a zucchini transplant with enough soil to cover the root ball without reaching up the stem. Finish up planting with a heavy watering, and you’re done!  , Keep an eye on your zucchini as they begin to grow. They’re relatively low-maintenance plants, but they do require a bit of upkeep in order to stay in tip-top producing condition. Pull out any weeds on site, and apply a layer of mulch if weeds continue to be a problem. Add a liquid growth fertilizer every 3-4 weeks to help promote growth in your zucchini. Cut off any diseased or dying fruit or branches to prevent disease from spreading to other parts of the plant, and to promote continuous growth., In order for your plant to start producing zucchini fruit, it has to become pollinated. If you lack bees or other pollinating insects in your area, or if your zucchini plant doesn’t seem to be producing any squash, you can pollinate your plant on your own. Pick a male zucchini flower, identifiable by its long stem, slender stem, and a visible stamen in the center. Carefully pull back the blossoms on the stem, and rub the stamen inside a female zucchini flower. Female zucchini flowers have short stems, a bulbous growth where the flower meets the stem, and lack stamens.You can do this to several flowers or just a few, depending on the amount of time you have and the growth you’re trying to promote.  When zucchini have grown to at least 4-inches in length, they are ready to be picked. Picking zucchini regularly promotes more squash production. Therefore, if you want lots of the squash, then pick all the zucchinis as they reach maturity. If you don’t have a need for too many squash, leave one or two zucchinis on the vine for the whole growing season to slow down the production. To harvest your zucchini, use a sharp knife to sever the squash from the rough stem that attaches it to the bush.   Enjoy the flowers in salads. These are edible and if you pick them, there won't be so many zucchini fruits growing. Crops will continue to grow until the first frosts if they established well during spring. You can simply cut the stem of a zucchini to promote growth, if you don’t want to harvest all of your squash yet.	Decide how you’re going to start your zucchini. Know when to plant. Find the perfect planting location. Prepare your soil. Start your seeds. Prepare your plot. Plant your zucchini. Maintain your zucchini plants. Promote growth. Harvest your zucchini.

It needs to be sheltered, and have some shade during the day. Somewhere near the herb garden or veggie patch is ideal, especially if it's easy to reach from your kitchen.;	Select a large space in your garden.
Unplug the cooler and turn off the water. Then remove the panels. Once the panels are removed, take out the used fiber pads., Open the drain plug if the swamp cooler has one. Allow the water to drain out. If there is no plug, siphon the water out with a hose.If you have a portable swamp cooler, make sure you drain the water outside and not inside your house. For window-mounted swamp coolers, you can leave it mounted in the window and let it drain outside the window. You may also choose to unmount it for maintenance and then put it back in the window.  Use a stiff brush or broom to sweep the inside of the swamp cooler. After you brush the debris and dirt loose, use a small vacuum that can be used on wet and dry surfaces to vacuum up the dirt.Debris can get inside the water pan. This can cause blockages that stop up the cooler, and may lead to unclean water cycling through it.  To clean the water reservoir, pour distilled white vinegar inside it. Let the vinegar sit in the water reservoir for an hour. You can also rinse the water tank with mild soap and warm water. Rinse the water tank well.When the time is up, drain the vinegar or soapy water into a bucket.  Use a scrub brush or cloth to clean the bottom of the water reservoir. Make sure to remove all stains and buildup, scrubbing harder if necessary. Rinse the water reservoir with clean water after you finish scrubbing.	Remove the panels and take out the fiber pads. Drain the water out of the swamp cooler. Brush out the inside of the swamp cooler. Soak the reservoir with vinegar. Scrub the water reservoir.
You can design and print a label using adhesive paper, or you can make a label from scratch using a piece of paper and clear tape. Make the label after you have poured the Mod Podge into the container and shaken it up. Here is how you can make a label from scratch, without a computer or printer:Write "Mod Podge" or "Decoupage" on a small piece of paper. Cut a piece of clear, packaging tape that is bigger than your label. Place the label face down onto the middle of the piece of tape. Wrap the packing tape around the glass container. Smooth the tape down to rid the label of any air bubbles.  Simply apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to the area you want decorated using a paint brush. You can also use a foam brush as well. Press your fabric or paper onto the wet Mod Podge, making sure to smooth out any ripples, bubbles or creases. Apply a second, thin layer of Mod Podge on top of your fabric or paper. You can always apply another coat of Mod Podge after the first one has dried., If you made Mod Podge out of glue and water, you can add a few drops of food coloring, and then paint it over some mason jars. This will create colored mason jars. Be sure to add 2 tablespoons of water-based gloss or varnish to your Mod Podge, or else the jars will be matte and frosted-looking.   If you wish to create tinted mason jars that look like sea glass, then omit the varnish.  Your homemade Mod Podge will not be as durable as the store-bought variety. You can make it more durable by wait until it has dried completely (several hours) and then applying spray-on acrylic sealer.   Simply hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface and spray the paint on using light, even strokes. Once the sealer has dried, you may add a second coat, if necessary. If you added varnish or glitter to your Mod Podge to make it glossy, be sure that you use an acrylic sealer with a gloss finish.	Consider adding a label the jar. Use Mod Podge to decorate boxes and other items. Consider tinting your Mod Podge. Consider sealing your project.
There are many resources online that use calculators to determine watts. They will do the formula for you.Such resources typically ask you to enter the number of volts, and the number of amps. Then you are asked to hit the “calculate” button to get the watts. Keep in mind, though, that online calculators aren’t always accurate because every appliance is going to be slightly different in its power needs. Some online sites will give you the watts needed if you click on the appliance type, such as a television or desktop computer.Sites sometimes have charts that list the watts used by various appliances, from refrigerators to boom boxes., You can figure out how many watts an appliance needs by looking for the data plate.   Find this on the back of your appliance. It’s likely to list how many volts, amps, and watts you need to power your appliance. You might find this information stamped on the back of the appliance. Or you could find the wattage listed on the nameplate.Wattage meters plug into the appliance, and they tell you the exact amount of power that the appliance needs to run. The wattage of an appliance might vary depending on its setting. For example, a radio is going to use more watts if you turn the volume on high.	Find an online calculator. Check your appliance.
You can use just about any type of fabric for this project. It should be about three times the height and width of your pillow., Lay the fabric down, wrong side up, on a flat surface. Set your pillow on top of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered., Fold the top edge of the fabric over the pillow and smooth it down. Repeat with the bottom edge. Make sure that the fabric to either side of the pillow is smooth., Smooth the fabric to the left side of the pillow down first. Fold the top edge down at an angle towards the center, then fold the bottom edge up to meet it. When you are done, you should have a "<" shape., Do the same thing you just did for the left side. Fold the top edge down at an angle, then the bottom edge. When you are done, you should have a ">" shape., Fold the left side down first, then the right. Make sure that they are still folded into points., A square knot is essentially a double-knot.Use the same knot as when starting to tie your shoes. Instead of doing the same knot twice, you reverse them: right-over-left, then left-over-right.Keep the fabric folded into points.  If you need to, tuck then inside the knot for extra security.	Cut your fabric. Place your pillow on top of the fabric. Fold the top and bottom edges of the fabric over the pillow. Fold the left side of the fabric into a point. Fold the right side of the fabric to a point. Wrap the sides of the fabric over the front of the pillow. Tie the ends of the fabric into a square knot. Tuck the ends of the fabrics under the knot.
If you care for fabrics incorrectly, then you could create a fire hazard. For example, some materials cannot be placed in the dryer. Make sure that you read all of your clothing labels so that you do not accidentally create a hazard., If you line dry items, make sure that they are located away from heat sources, such as your dryer, iron, or radiator. If the clothes came in contact with the hot appliance, they could become a fire hazard.Even if they don’t catch fire, you could damage your clothes.  Because your iron is small, it’s easy to overlook it; however, irons are still a source of heat. If you accidentally leave a hot iron laying with the hot side down, it could ignite the item it’s on, especially if it’s on your ironing board.   Always check your iron to make sure that it’s turned off before you walk away. Make a habit of not leaving your iron with the hot side down. To stay safe, unplug your iron between uses.  Piles of laundry can create a hazard by overheating a power cord, hiding damage, or falling behind machines. Instead, store both clean and dirty laundry in either laundry baskets or a hamper.  Items like paint, stain removers, gasoline cans, or chemicals need to be stored away from your hot appliances, such as your dryer, iron, hot water heater, or radiator.If you can store the items elsewhere, it’s best to relocate them to an area that doesn’t have so many heat sources.	Read the care labels on your clothing. Hang your clothes in a safe location. Use your iron safely. Avoid piling laundry on the floor or appliances. Avoid storing combustible materials near hot appliances.
If your vehicle was built prior to 1996, you will need an OBD I scanner. Vehicles made after 1996 will need an OBD II scanner. Connect the code scanner to the port beneath the dashboard and turn it on. Once connected, use the scanner to bring up the error codes making the check engine light come on.In some code scanners, it will provide the English description of the error code on the read out. If your code scanner does not, you will need to look up the code the scanner shows you to find out what it is.  Insert the key into the ignition and start the engine. Wait a minute for the engine idle to level off, then use a pen and paper to write down the RPMs that your engine settles and idles at.You may need to let the engine run for a few minutes in order for it to come down to its normal idle speed. Keep the paper you write the RPMs on handy so you can compare it to the engine’s idle as you continue the test.  With the idle RPMs noted, shut the vehicle back off and remove the key from the ignition. Open the hood and locate the Idle Control Motor. Once you locate it, disconnect it.The way to disconnect your Idle Control Motor will vary from application to application; refer to your vehicle’s service manual for more specific instruction as to how to disconnect it. You can usually disconnect the idle control motor by unplugging the wiring clip going into it.  With the Idle Control Motor disconnected, get back into the vehicle and start the engine again. The engine should still start and run without any issue despite the idle control motor being disconnected.Be sure to tuck the wiring you disconnected up in the engine bay so it doesn’t get caught in any moving parts.  Allow the engine to run for a minute so it settles to a consistent idle, then take note of any difference in the idle RPMs versus the idle you observed earlier. If the idle has not changed at all, it’s likely because your idle control motor has not been functioning.If the idle control motor was working, disconnecting it should have created a difference in the engine’s idle. This test confirms there’s an issue with the idle control motor, but not what the issue may be.  If you identified a difference in engine idle RPMs with the Idle control motor connected and disconnected, confirm your hypothesis by reconnecting it and starting the engine again.The idle should go back to what it was when the idle control motor was last connected. Refer to the note you took about idle RPMs to compare it to your first reading.	Use a code scanner to check error codes. Start the engine and take note of the idle RPMs. Shut the car off and disconnect the Idle Control Motor. Restart the engine. Look for a difference in idle speed. Shut off the engine and reconnect the Idle Control Motor.
You want to make sure that the company you are going to sign with is a legitimate, experienced company that is going to make money for you. You’ll want to look at things like:Their length of experience in the business Their credit list - the artists they have worked with The terms of the deal they are offering Their professionalism and look of their web site; , Word of mouth is a powerful tool in the music business. If you know other singers or songwriters who have already licensed their music, find out who they have worked with. Ask if they have been satisfied with their deals and with the money they have received. The way a company treats one artist is a sign of how they’re going to treat you., Get out and meet people in the business. Listen to what kind of music is getting played, and where it’s getting played. Try to determine where your music will fit in. Licensing may include TV commercials, TV and movie background music, theme songs. Even licensing for background elevator music brings in money and leads to exposure. Do the research to figure out where you are going to have the best chances to get your sound out there.	Research licensing companies online. Talk with other artists you know. Attend music conventions.
Most modern vehicles have a serpentine belt instead of a fan belt, though the names may be used interchangeably. Older model vehicles and some high performance applications still utilize fan belts instead of electric fans. Older belts were made of neoprene and would benefit from the application of belt dressing, but newer EPDM-made belts may dry out as a result of using belt dressing.If your fan belt was installed after the year 2000, it is likely an EPDM-made belt. The two belts are difficult to tell apart visually until they are worn out and need to be replaced.; , You will need to apply the belt dressing directly onto the belt. In order to do so, you will need to open the hood of the vehicle and remove any cowl cover that may be in place over the fan belt itself. This may require the use of some basic hand tools like a socket or hand wrench.Some vehicles have engine covers that will need to be removed. You will need direct line of sight and access to the belt while the engine is running.  The fan belt will likely be located at the front of the engine, attached to a pulley that rotates the cooling fan or fans for the radiator. It will often be black or grey. You may be able to locate it faster by starting at the radiator fan and working backward.In many older American vehicles, the fan belt is connected to shaft with a large metal fan at the end and is easy to identify. Serpentine or accessory belts that serve the same function as a fan belt may be on the side of a horizontally mounted engine.  Ensure the vehicle is in park with the parking brake engaged, then start the engine. You will need the engine to be running in order to apply the belt dressing evenly over the entire length of the belt.Leave the hood open and engine covers removed when starting the engine.  With the engine running, spray the belt dressing directly onto the back of the fan belt. As the engine runs, the fan belt will be moving quickly, so you can leave the can in one place and spray onto the belt as it spins.Spray the belt dressing onto the belt until the entire belt is wet. The squeaking from the fan belt should stop almost immediately.	Ensure your vehicle is equipped with a neoprene belt. Open the hood. Locate the fan belt. Start the vehicle. Spray the belt dressing directly onto the belt.
The antenna is one of the simplest parts of a homemade radio: all you need is a long piece of wire and a small cylinder. Ideally, the wire should be 50 feet long, but if you don’t have that much, you can use 15 or 20 feet. Use any small diameter insulated wire, like a 20 or 22 gauge., In this radio circuit, you'll need to make a simple inductor. Inductors store energy in the form of a magnetic field, though the specifics and behaviors of inductors is a little complicated. You can make your own by wrapping wire around a small cylinder. Find a small cylinder. You can use a glass bottle, a cardboard tube, or any other cylinder you can find from around the house. Just make sure it’s not metal, because metal will conduct electricity and throw off your signal. Look for any object with a 2-3 inch diameter. Gather five inches of slack, then tape the wire to the cylinder at the five-inch point. You can use electrical tape, or any other tape you have on hand. Begin wrapping the wire around the cylinder slowly, pushing the coils together to avoid gaps. Continue wrapping until the whole cylinder is coiled with wire. Tape off the end, then measure another five inches of slack. Cut the wire off at the five-inch point. You should now have a cylinder completely coiled over with five inches of slack on either side.  Tuning capacitors set a resonance frequency for the radio, meaning that they allow you to tune in to certain resonances of the medium wave radio bands.Variable tuning capacitors aren’t too expensive, costing around 10-15 dollars if you buy online at sites like Amazon. You may also be able to find one at a local electronics or hobby store like Radio Shack.  Capacitors and resistors are small electronic components that affect the flow of electricity in different ways. Capacitance is measured in farads (F), while resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). These measurements help you to know which type of capacitors and resistors to buy.Buy one 33pF (pico-farad) capacitor, one 10nF (nano-farad) capacitor and one 22uF (micro-farad) electrolytic capacitor. Capacitors can be bought from a variety of online shops and electronics hobby stores very cheaply, with most vendors selling these specific parts from between two cents and 25 cents.Buy one 1 megohm resistor. Keep in mind that “one megohm” may be abbreviated as “1.0M Ohm” As with the capacitor, shop online or look at electronics shop, and expect prices to range from 10 cents to 25 cents. Always buy extras of your components. These pieces are very small, and are made inexpensively, so it’s not uncommon to get a faulty piece every once in a while.  Amplifiers help us take the small signals that we pick up from the radio waves and make them bigger so that we can hear them. For this radio, we’ll use something called an operational amplifier, or op-amp. Op-amps are small integrated circuits with 8 prongs, and they look a bit like small spiders.Look online for a “general purpose” op amp. Search on Amazon or in Mouser Electronics’ catalog, and look for amps in the four to seven dollar price range., Speakers receive voltage amplified by the op amp and turn them into sound waves that we can hear. The voltage moves a magnet, which in turn moves a cone that produces the sound waves.If you have a speaker around the house, feel free to use it. Otherwise, look online for any kind of small speaker with two speaker-wire leads (not the kind that plugs in with a headphone jack).  Breadboards allow you to create a mockup of a circuit without requiring any soldering. They have many rows and columns of holes, and electrical connections can be made by simply placing component wires into adjacent holes.Breadboards are an inexpensive investment for anyone with an interest in electronics, as they’re easy to use and can be changed over and over again to create new circuits. Look online or in a hobby store, where they’re sold for five to ten dollars.  You’ll need a bit of wire in two different colors to make into jumpers. You’ll also use it to attach to the ends of your power source. Make sure you have around 10 or 15 inches of each color.  This particular circuit requires 9 volts of electricity to function. Any variety of 9 volt battery will work. Tape one five inch wire to the negative (flat) end and one five inch wire to the positive (raised) end with electrical tape to get it ready for attachment.   Cut two five-inch pieces of shielded wire. One will attach to each pole of the battery, and then to the circuit board. Using wire strippers or a sharp knife, cut 1-2mm of shielding off of each end of the wires. Tape one exposed-metal end of one wire to the positive (raised) end of the battery, using electrical tape. Tape the other wire to the negative (flat) end of the battery, again using electrical tape.  Lay your breadboard on the table in front of you “long-wise” so that the long edge is facing towards you and the short edges are on the outside. It doesn’t matter which side is on top, because both halves of the breadboard work the same way. Connectivity is achieved by placing components adjacently into the short columns, not the long rows.The only exceptions are the long, connected rows at the top and bottoms of the breadboard. These connect left-to right, not up and down.  Most breadboards have a long trough running across the middle, separating the board into two equal halves. You’ll want to place your op-amp so that four legs are on one side of the trough and four legs are on the other; four legs on the top half and four legs on the bottom half. This will allow you to build the input (the antenna) on one side of the breadboard and the output (the speaker and tuning capacitor) on the other side.         Be aware that the amplifier has a “front” and a “back”. The “front” of the op-amp has a small circular divot and the “back” does not. Make sure that the “front” is facing towards the left of the breadboard.  Current flows both ways over a resistor, so you don’t have to worry about it being “backwards” or “forwards”.Place one lead into the hole directly above the op-amp’s second leg on the top side of the amp. Place the other leg in the hole directly below the op-amp’s second leg on the bottom side of the amp. To clarify, “second leg” means second from the left, or “front” of the op-amp.  Place the short lead of your 10nF capacitor in the hole directly below the lead of your 1.0M Ohm resistor, on the bottom side of the breadboard. Next, place the long lead of your 10nF capacitor in a hole four columns over, to the left.  Most resistors and ceramic capacitors, like your 10nF and 33pF capacitors, let voltage travel over them in both directions. However, electrolytic capacitors do not: they are “polarized”. This means that they can only accept voltage going in one direction, and it needs to come in on the shorter, or positive leg. Do not apply voltage to the negative, or shorter leg: this can cause the capacitor to fail in a puff of smoke.On the top side of your breadboard, place the long lead of the 22uF capacitor in the hole directly above the top lead of your 1.0M resistor. Again, keep in mind that capacitors only allow voltage to flow in one direction, so the long lead needs to be the one connected to the resistor. Place the short lead in a hole four rows away from the long lead, to the right.  Get your black and red insulated wire. Cut one black jumper wire and one red jumper wire. Make sure they’re long enough to reach holes several rows away. Strip the insulation from one both ends of the jumpers. Using a pair of wire strippers, scissors, or a knife, cut off about 2cm of insulation from each end of the wire. This will allow the wire to form connectivity when placed into a hole on the breadboard.         Put one end of the red wire into the hole right above the first leg of the op amp, on the top side. Stick the other end into the long row at the top of the breadboard. Unlike the rest of the grid of the breadboard, which makes connections going up and down, this long row creates connections going left to right across the whole row. Place one end of the black jumper wire into the hole beneath the fourth, or furthest right leg of the op-amp, on the bottom side of the breadboard. Connect the remaining lead to the bottommost row of the breadboard.  This capacitor, like the first one you placed, isn’t polarized. There’s no backwards and forwards for this one, as it allows current to pass over it in both directions. It won’t matter which lead goes in which spot.   Look at your 10nF capacitor. One of the leads is attached to a bottom leg of the op-amp. The other isn’t connected to anything yet. Place one lead of your 22pF capacitor into the hole directly above this unconnected 10nF lead. Put the other lead of your 22pF capacitor into a hole four rows away, to the left. Make sure the row you place it in is empty.  Your antenna has remained unused up until this point, so let’s go ahead and attach it. Place one end of the antenna into the hole directly above the empty lead of the 22pF capacitor; the lead that you just placed four rows away to the left. Spool the rest of your wire out across the room, as far as the walls will allow you.  Place the variable capacitor on the table, on the top side of the breadboard. Connect one lead in the hole above the rightmost lead of your 22pF capacitor. Place the other lead in any hole on the bottommost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with your black jumper wire.  Place the coil on the table below your breadboard. You saved five inches of slack on either side of the coil, so place the left-hand lead into a hole on the bottommost row, where it will connect to your variable capacitor and your black jumper wire. Place the right-hand lead in a hole in the row where your 22pF capacitor and your 10nF capacitor make connection with the variable capacitor’s lead.  Place your speaker on the table to the right of the variable capacitor. Your speaker will have one black lead and one red lead, so untwist them and get ready to plug them in. Put the red lead into any hole on the topmost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with the red jumper wire. Place the black lead into the hole directly above the short lead of your 22uF electrolytic capacitor.  Now that your circuit is finished, give it some power. If you haven’t already used electrical tape to attach wires to the positive and negative sides of the battery, do that now. Remember, the flat end of the battery is negative, and the raised side of the battery is positive.         Place the positive wire into any hole on the bottommost row of the breadboard. It will now create connectivity with the black jumper wire and the variable capacitor. Place the negative wire into any hole on the topmost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with the speaker and the red jumper wire.  Once the circuit has power, the electricity will begin to flow to the amp and the speaker. The speaker should now be making sound, whether it’s a faint radio signal or just static. This is a good indication that all of your components are correctly connected.  Turn the variable tuner slowly, listening for audible radio stations. The further away from AM radio stations you live, the weaker the signals will be. However, be patient and turn the knob slowly. You’ll easily find a station with a little patience.  All circuits are touchy, and many require troubleshooting, especially if this is the first circuit you’ve ever built. Make sure that all leads are firmly pressed into their holes, and that they are all in the correct spots. Continue to check connections until you hear audio. If it fails to work, it may be necessary to rebuild the circuit and repeat the steps again.	Make an antenna. Make a coil. Buy a variable tuning capacitor. Buy capacitors and a resistor.

Despite the all-in-one rocket ships popular in science fiction stories, going to the moon is a mission best broken into separate parts: achieving low-Earth orbit, transferring from Earth to lunar orbit, landing on the moon, and reversing the steps to return to Earth.   Some science fiction stories that depicted a more realistic approach to going to the moon had astronauts going to an orbiting space station where smaller rockets were docked that would take them to the moon and back to the station. Because the United States was in competition with the Soviet Union, this approach was not adopted; the space stations Skylab, Salyut, and the International Space Station were all put up after Project Apollo had ended. The Apollo project used the three-stage Saturn V rocket. The bottom-most first stage lifted the assembly off the launching pad to a height of 42 miles (68 km), the second stage boosted it almost to low Earth orbit, and the third stage pushed it into orbit and then toward the moon.The Constellation project proposed by NASA for a return to the moon in 2018 consists of a two different two-stage rockets. There are two different first stage rocket designs: a crew-only lifting stage consisting of a single five-segment rocket booster, the Ares I, and a crew-and-cargo lifting stage consisting of five rocket engines beneath an external fuel tank supplemented by two five-segment solid rocket boosters, the Ares V. The second stage for both versions uses a single-liquid fuel engine. The heavy lifting assembly would carry the lunar orbital capsule and lander, which the astronauts would transfer to when the two rocket systems dock.; , Because the moon has no atmosphere, you have to bring your own oxygen so you have something to breathe while you’re there, and when you stroll about on the lunar surface you need to be in a spacesuit to protect yourself from the blazing heat of the two-week-long lunar day or the mind-numbing cold of the equally long lunar night – not to mention the radiation and micro-meteoroids the lack of atmosphere exposes the surface to.You’ll also need to have something to eat. Most of the foods used by the astronauts in space missions have to be freeze-dried and concentrated to reduce their weight and then be reconstituted by adding water when eaten.They also need to be high-protein foods to minimize the amount of body waste generated after eating. (At least you can wash them down with Tang.) Everything you take into space with you adds weight, which increases the amount of fuel necessary to lift it and the rocket carrying it into space, so you won’t be able to take too many personal effects into space – and those lunar rocks will weigh 6 times as much on Earth as they do on the moon.  A launch window is the time range for launching the rocket from Earth to be able to land in the desired area of the moon during a time when there would be sufficient light for exploring the landing area. The launch window was actually defined two ways, as a monthly window and a daily window.   The monthly launch window takes advantage of where the planned landing area is with respect to the Earth and the sun. Because Earth’s gravity forces the moon to keep the same side facing Earth, exploration missions were chosen in areas of the Earth-facing side to make radio communication between Earth and the moon possible. The time also had to be chosen at a time when the sun was shining on the landing area. The daily launch window takes advantage of launch conditions, such as the angle at which the spacecraft would be launched, the performance of booster rockets, and the presence of a ship downsite from the launch to track the rocket’s flight progress. Early on, light conditions for launching were important, as daylight made it easier to oversee aborts on the launch pad or before achieving orbit, as well as being able to document aborts with photographs. As NASA gained more practice in overseeing missions, daylight launches were less necessary; Apollo 17 was launched at night., Ideally, a rocket bound for the moon should be launched vertically to take advantage of Earth’s rotation in helping it achieve orbital velocity. However, in Project Apollo, NASA allowed for a possible range of 18 degrees either direction from vertical without significantly compromising the launch., In escaping the pull of Earth’s gravity, there are two velocities to consider: escape velocity and orbital velocity. Escape velocity is the velocity needed to escape a planet’s gravity completely, while orbital velocity is the velocity needed to go into orbit around a planet. Escape velocity for Earth’s surface is about 25,000 mph or 7 miles per second (40,248 km/hr or 11.2 km/s), while orbital velocity at the surface is .Orbital velocity for Earth’s surface is only around 18,000 mph (7.9 km/s); it takes less energy to achieve orbital velocity than escape velocity.   Furthermore, the values for orbital and escape velocity drop the further away from Earth’s surface you go, with escape velocity always about 1.414 (the square root of 2) times orbital velocity., After achieving low Earth orbit and verifying that all ship’s systems are functional, it’s then time to fire thrusters and go to the moon.   With Project Apollo, this was done by firing the third-stage thrusters one last time to propel the spacecraft toward the moon.Along the way, the command/service module (CSM) separated from the third stage, turned around, and docked with the lunar excursion module (LEM) carried in the upper part of the third stage. With Project Constellation, the plan is to have the rocket carrying the crew and its command capsule dock in low Earth orbit with the departure stage and lunar lander brought up by the cargo rocket. The departure stage would then fire its thrusters and send the spacecraft to the moon.  Once the spacecraft enters the gravity of the moon, fire the thrusters to slow it down and place it in orbit around the moon.  Both Project Apollo and Project Constellation feature separate orbital and landing modules. The Apollo command module required that one of the three astronauts remain behind to pilot it, while the other two boarded the lunar module.Project Constellation’s orbital capsule is designed to be run automatically, so that all four of the astronauts it is designed to carry could board its lunar lander, if desired., Because the moon has no atmosphere, it is necessary to use rockets to slow the lunar lander’s descent to about 100 mph (160 km/hr) to ensure an intact landing and slower still to guarantee its passengers a soft landing.Ideally, the planned landing surface should be free of sizable boulders; this is why the Sea of Tranquility was chosen as the landing site for Apollo 11., Once you land on the moon, it’s time to take that one small step and explore the lunar surface. While there, you can gather lunar rocks and dust for analysis on Earth, and if you brought along a collapsible lunar rover as the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions did, you can even hot-rod on the lunar surface at up to 11.2 mph (18 km/hr).(Don’t bother to rev the engine, though; the unit is battery powered, and there’s no air to carry the sound of a revving engine, anyway.)  , After you’ve done your business on the moon, pack up your samples and tools and board your lunar lander for the return trip.   The Apollo lunar module was designed in two stages: a descent stage to get it down to the moon and an ascent stage to lift the astronauts back into lunar orbit. The descent stage was left behind on the moon (and so also was the lunar rover)., The Apollo command module and the Constellation orbital capsule are both designed to take astronauts from the moon back to Earth. The contents of the lunar landers are transferred to the orbiters, and the lunar landers are then un-docked, to eventually crash back to the moon., The main thruster on the Apollo and Constellation service modules is fired to escape the moon’s gravity, and the spacecraft is directed back to Earth. On entering Earth’s gravity, the service module thruster is pointed toward Earth and fired again to slow the command capsule down before being jettisoned.  The command module/capsule’s heat shield is exposed to protect the astronauts from the heat of re-entry. As the vessel enters the thicker part of Earth’s atmosphere, parachutes are deployed to slow the capsule further.   For Project Apollo, the command module splashed down in the ocean, as previous manned NASA missions had done, and was recovered by a Navy vessel. The command modules were not re-used.For Project Constellation, the plan is to touch down on land, as Soviet manned space missions did, with splashdown in the ocean an option if touchdown on land is not possible. The command capsule is designed to be refurbished, replacing its heat shield with a new one, and reused.	Plan to go in stages. Pack for the trip. Determine the launch window. Lift off.

Over time, your windows can collect dust and grime, preventing the maximum amount of sunlight to enter the room. This is an easy, and often forgotten, step to increasing the natural light that enters the room.Clean your windows with a commercial glass cleaner or homemade window cleaning solution.  Make sure that you are allowing as much natural light into the room as you can. If the room lacks windows, and it is within your budget, consider adding a window to allow more natural light to enter the room.Trim trees that block natural light from entering the room. Open the curtains and blinds during the day. Move furniture away from the windows.  If the room does not have another room or attic above it, consider installing a skylight. Skylights are windows that are installed in the ceiling of the room. Much light ceiling fixtures, they allow light to rain down in the room.Install a skylight in an interior room that cannot have a window.	Keep your windows clean. Take advantage of natural light.

Like most things, the first step to getting involved is getting informed and the internet is a great place to start. Take some time to browse your nearby theater's website, if they have one,and read about their mission state, what shows they are casting, if they have crew openings, if they are holding audition, or are in need of donations., They can help direct you and suggest whom to speak with further either by email, phone, or in-person.  Chances are you’ve already visited the theater before as a patron, but if not plan on checking out a show. Stick around after the show, too, and see if you can chat up current cast members. This is a good way to get a vibe of the troupe and get tips or pointers from someone already in the know.	Research your local theater online. Call and speak to a staff member. Visit in-person.
These cables have an HDMI plug on one end and a smaller HDMI plug on the other end, as opposed to traditional HDMI cables.  The 2017 line of Kindle Fire HD's does not support HDMI output. If your TV doesn't support HDMI input, you'll also need to buy an HDMI-to-analog converter box and a set of RCA male-to-male cables.  The large end of the cable should go into the TV, and the small end connects to your Kindle Fire HD's micro-HDMI port.  The micro-HDMI port is next to the charging port on the bottom of the Kindle Fire HD. If you're using an HDMI-to-analog converter: plug the Kindle Fire HD into the converter using the HDMI cable, then plug the converter into the TV with the RCA cables.  You should see your Kindle Fire HD's screen reflected on your TV's screen, though you may need to rotate your Kindle Fire HD in order for the display to appear right-side-up on your TV.  If necessary, you'll also need to change your TV's input to match the slot to which the Kindle Fire HD is attached (e.g., Video 3).	Buy an HDMI-to-micro-HDMI cable. Connect your Kindle Fire HD to your TV with the HDMI cable. Turn on your TV.
A comic book binder with clear plastic sleeves will help prevent folding and tearing when comic books are kept on a bookshelf or in a box. Using a filing cabinet is another option.   Paperback and hardback collections can be stored on a bookshelf as usual.  Store your comics in a dry area at room temperature. Keep them away from direct sunlight. If they are kept in a storage area instead of on the shelf, keep them in plastic bags to minimize water damage.  Keep issues from the same series together, and order them by issue number. Use folder dividers to separate series kept on the same shelf or in the same container.  Purchase plastic slips to further protect your most valuable issues. Keep these in a secure place in a designated area of your comic collection, so you can easily locate them. When handling them, wear latex gloves to prevent leaving traces of skin oil on the pages.	Keep comics in sturdy containers. Protect comics from heat and moisture. Organize your collection. Protect valuable comics.
Any type of household vinegar or even table salt in water can be used to antique brass. This can take longer to take effect than the other methods — several hours for vinegar, and up to several days with salt water— but you do not have to handle any dangerous chemicals and probably already have the necessary ingredients in your kitchen.   Prepare the brass first as described above to ensure the antiquing succeeds. Wear rubber gloves for any method to prevent getting oil on the brass.  A mix of equal parts table salt and water will oxidize the brass, simply speeding up the natural aging process brass undergoes. Apply it with a small paintbrush over the entire surface and reapply daily until you've achieved the appearance you enjoy., Apply with a brush or simply dip the piece in any type of vinegar. Allow it to dry, then apply an additional coat if you'd like a darker color.   Mix a spoonful of table salt into the vinegar for a greener patina.Heating the brass with a hair dryer or oven to around 450ºF (230ºC) will produce more noticeable results, but you'll need oven mitts or thick gardener gloves to handle it at this temperature., This may not achieve the authentic appearance that ammonia or antiquing solution will, but some people prefer the "gingerbread" appearance that results.In any case, it is certainly safer and less expensive than those methods.   Pour some vinegar into a plastic bucket with an airtight lid. Place wooden blocks or other objects into the bucket so a stable, flat surface is dry above the level of the vinegar. Place the brass on top of the objects. Seal the lid to trap the vinegar fumes and let them alter the brass for several hours or overnight.  Once the result you want is achieved, which may take several applications, wash the brass in warm water. Dry it gently with a towel or by applying heat.   Once it is dry, you have the option to preserve its color by coating with a brass lacquer or wax.	Use vinegar or salt water to antique your brass safely and easily. Apply salt water to make brass slightly darker. Coat with vinegar instead for more pronounced aging. Use vinegar vapors for a warm brown appearance. Whichever method you used, wash with warm water and dry.
Prepare as much as possible while the boat is on the trailer, and on dry land. Prepare the engine, fuel, safety gear, mooring lines, fenders, etc. You should be ready to drive the boat off the trailer right after it's backed down the ramp. Other people want to launch as well, and tempers will flare if you use dock time to do things you could have done in the parking lot. It is a good idea to have your own written checklist.; , If bringing along guests, brief them on where to go and what tasks to do. If bringing along children, forbid young children and pets from playing or loitering on a boat launch ramp as this is a roadway that transitions into a waterway. Keep children and pets supervised by an adult in a different area than at the boat launch ramp. NEVER let children or pets play or be unattended at a boat launch ramp.  Unplug the trailer towing light assembly from the vehicle's electrical system.  This is very important!  , Undo and stow the hold down straps, but leave the winch hook in the bow eye. , This is easiest done with two people: one driving and one as a spotter. With a truck or SUV it can be easier to see when backing up if you put the tailgate down or open the rear hatch/door/window. Drive slowly, making tiny fine-tune steering corrections as you go. How far to back the boat trailer into the water depends on many factors - type of trailer, depth of the water, type of boat, etc. A good rule of thumb is to back in until the water is just above the hubs on the trailer. Be careful about backing in too far otherwise the tow vehicle might become stuck.   When backing down the ramp, have the vehicle in neutral. This makes it easier to control the vehicle quickly. If something fails, quickly put it in gear and go forward.    When getting out of the vehicle on the ramp, apply the handbrake first, check that it is holding fast, and then put it in park. When the vehicle is sitting in park, the whole weight is sitting on a little piece of metal in the trans (parking pawl). Should this break and the park brake doesn't hold, you launch the whole rig. ,,,, Make sure the engine is in the water, and turn it over. Once it's running, undo the winch hook from the bow eye, and back the boat out of the trailer. For smaller boats, you can just push the boat out while holding a mooring line.  Tie the mooring lines to cleats on the dock. Use fenders to prevent the hull from being scratched.  Boat ramps can be slippery with moss and algae and it is important to not let the vehicle's tires spin. If your tow vehicle is equipped with four-wheel drive, this can be useful if your back tires start spinning. Once the boat is afloat and secured to the dock, drive the vehicle back up the ramp and park it at the landing, in the designated parking area.  Do not turn the boats steering wheel in the opposite direction of the dock, with the boat a mere few inches from the dock, and just hit the throttle - or your engine's outdrive will push your boat right into the dock, scratching or gouging the gelcoat in the side of the hull. Make sure that you have pushed away several feet from the boat dock before driving away, so that your stern has ample room to turn the boat without scraping the boat alongside of the dock.	Prepare the boat. Make a plan together. Unplug the trailer towing light assembly. Put the drain plug in the boat. Undo the hold down straps. Have your dock lines and fenders ready to go for immediate use.  , Back the trailer down the ramp. Ensure that your tow vehicle has the parking brake set before exiting the vehicle. Lower the lower unit (for boats with outboard and inboard-outboard engines).  , Turn on the bilge blower to remove any gasoline fumes that may have accumulated in the bilge.  , Ensure that no person is near the engine when starting and that no person or boat is in your path before you put the boat in reverse.  , Pay attention to currents, wind and waves that can easily pull your boat off course and into a collision course with another boat or dock.  , Crank the engine. Secure the boat to the dock. Slowly pull the vehicle out. When pulling away from the dock, it is important to understand that unlike a car, the stern of the boat is pushed to one side or the other, whereas a car's pivot point is in the front.
For a 12" wreath, you'll need about 60 yards (54.9 m) of ribbon total. Basically, cut loads and loads of ribbon. Most ribbon fabrics will work, but the stiffer the better. At such a short length, most will stay erect and fluffy. As for widths, you'll find it's easiest to work with ribbons around 1" (2.5 cm) wide or less.          Experiment with a bunch of different colors. Think about using a zinger fabric -- a handful of more muted colors and one color that really pops. Cut the ends at an angle. This is not only pretty, but keeps them from fraying as easily.; , Take one color and tie a handful of pieces at different points around the wreath. After a dozen or so are tied, switch colors. This guarantees an even gradient to your wreath.          Tie 'em tight! You don't want them coming undone. And make sure you cover all parts of the frame -- there might be some small pieces that aren't in the main circle, but provide structure.  Once you think you're getting done, scrunch the ribbons together. New spaces should form for you to tie in more. There should be some overlap -- this will make your wreath voluminous and full.  Though your wreath is beautiful now (and ready to hang!) you may add a few touches if you'd like. Does it feel like it's missing anything?          A thin sheen of spray glitter can add a nice touch to ribbon that's otherwise solid-colored and uniform. A giant bow on top may make your wreath seem more wreath-like and less like, well, a circle.	Cut your ribbon into 7-8" (18-20 cm) pieces. Tie knots of ribbon around the wreath form. Adjust the ribbons and squeeze in more. Add any finishing touches, if desired.
If your goal is to get your waterworks started, you may have to go over the top in your imagining. Usually, there is at least one thing, like mistreated animals or impoverished children, that you can’t help getting sad over. Use these to water up! Some other ideas that might get you teary-eyed include:   War Starvation Disease Death, Try to assume the position you were in at a time when you were teary-eyed for some reason. Then, as closely as you are able, mimic the motions, rate of breathing, and noises you made at that time. Though this might seem a little awkward, with practice your body’s muscle memory can be trained to activate your tear glands to water your eyes., You don’t have to be an actor to make use of actor’s tricks. By identifying with a character, either an imaginary one or a live-action one you’ve seen on TV, you can make yourself misty eyed.   Try to choose a character whose situation you can relate to. Relatable characters will make it easier for you to slip into their mindset, and from there, get the watering response going., Some phrases may have the ability to really upset you. Professional actors and acting teachers refer to this as a “power phrase” due to the fact that it can be used to give you power over your emotions. Simply repeat the phrase to yourself until you feel your eyes begin to moisten. Some examples of power phrases include:   ”I’m not good enough.” ”No one will ever love me.” ”I can’t do anything right.” ”Why does everybody leave me?”, Music can evoke a powerful emotion response inside of you, both in negative and positive ways. Think of a song that you find particularly depressing, and loop it in your head. You may also want to think about things you find sad or depressing as the music plays in your head.   To help yourself get into the mood to cue your eye watering, you might want to bring some headphones and a music player so you can listen to the sad song before you need your eyes to water. When it’s time to water up, take off the headphones and continue playing the song in your head until your tear glands begin to water.	Imagine things you find sad. Use muscle memory to trigger teary eyes. Assume a teary-eyed persona. Find your power phrase. Think about sad music.
Almond trees, which are native to the hot and arid climate of the Middle East and South Asia, do best with hot summers and mild winters and do not adapt to other conditions especially well. Almonds do not usually grow at all in colder climates.Unless you have a large, carefully-controlled indoor growing setup, you may have a hard time growing almonds outside of areas with a Mediterranean or Middle Eastern climate profile.   If you're in the US, a good way of determining whether your local climate is suitable for growing almonds is to use a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.These maps rate geographical areas by their minimum temperatures, giving an approximate indication of the types of plants that can survive there. For almonds, you'll want your area to have a rating of at least "6" — higher is better. According to this system, suitable areas in the US include much of central and southern California as well as parts of Arizona, Texas, and inland Florida.; , You have two options for starting your almond tree — you can either use seeds (fresh, unprocessed nuts) or seedlings (young trees).Nuts allow you to experience the growing process from the very beginning, but can be more time and effort-intensive. On the other hand, seedlings are more convenient, but can be a little more expensive.   If you want to harvest edible almonds, you'll want to be sure to pick seeds or seedlings for a fruit-bearing sweet almond tree. Keep in mind that bitter almonds are inedible and that not all sweet almond trees bear fruit. These varieties are only suitable for shade and decoration. Talk to the staff at your local garden supply store if you're unsure of which almond trees are productive.  Almond trees do well with lots of sun. Before you get started, find a spot in your yard or garden that gets plenty of full, direct sun, free from shade. You will grow the almond tree in a pot prior to planting it in the ground, but it's still important to choose a location ahead of time — the tree will only fit in the pot for so long.   You'll also want to make sure your growing spot has well-draining soil. Almond trees don't do well if water is allowed to pool around their roots — this can lead to root rot.  If you're growing your almond tree from a seed (which are just almond nuts surrounded by their protective husks), start by germinating the seed in a controlled environment — once it's started, you can plant it in a pot or in the ground. First, gather your seeds in a single large bowl (the more you use, the better — some may not sprout or may succumb to mold). Then, germinate them according to the following steps:          Add water and let the seeds soak overnight. The next day, use a nutcracker to crack the almond shells open slightly — the shell should still hold itself together, but you should just be able to see the nut inside. Throw away any seeds that show signs of mold. Fill a few small flowerpots with potting soil. Make sure the pots have holes on the bottom for drainage. Plant the seeds an inch or two under the surface of the soil with the cracks pointing upward. Rest the flowerpot indoors in an area that will receive direct sunlight. Now, just wait for seedlings to sprout.  Once your seedlings have started to grow (or, alternatively, if you bought ready-to-plant seedlings), prepare your decided-upon spot in the ground for planting. Make a small mound an inch or two tall (and slightly wider than it is tall) for each seedling. Push the seedling about an inch into the center of the mound until it's below the surface of the soil. This mound technique helps prevent water from gathering around the roots of the plant as it grows, which can cause serious problems (including root rot).          If you're planting germinated seedlings, plant them at the end of winter or in the spring. Alternatively, if you're planting un-germinated seeds, plant them in late fall so that they have a chance to sprout in the spring at the very start of the bloom season.If planting multiple trees, space each tree at least about 20 feet (6.1 m) apart. This gives the trees' roots plenty of space and allows for easy, effective irrigation., Immediately after planting, almond trees should be "tanked" (watered heavily) with at least a gallon of water to thoroughly hydrate the soil.After this initial watering, you'll want to maintain a regular watering schedule as the tree grows. Almond trees thrive in hot climates, but they're not desert plants, so watering is vital to keep the growing plant healthy.         Water each almond plant at least once a week unless it rains. Established trees can survive on two or three inches of water without rain, but growing plants will usually require more.Alternatively, you may want to use a drip irrigation system. This is an especially convenient choice if you have many trees.  Once the growing season begins, it's appropriate to use a reasonable amount of fertilizer to boost your plant's growth (though this is not required). For young trees, you'll want to use small doses of Nitrogen every few weeks throughout the growing season. For mature trees, on the other hand, you'll want to use about two pounds of urea or 30 pounds of manure (applied once).   No matter what kind of fertilizer you're using, be sure to "water it in" after you apply it. Fertilizer can have a harmful "burning" effect on the plant if it's applied without water or an excessive amount is used at once., Fruit-bearing almond trees will start to grow small green fruits during the growing season — these hard, sour fruits aren't a common dish in the Western world, but are semi-popular in the Middle East. In the fall, these fruits will harden, turn brown, and crack open. Once the exposed almond husks have a dry, brown exterior, they're ready for harvesting. See below for more information on harvesting.   There are two types of almond tree: trees that grow "sweet" almonds and trees that grow "bitter" almonds. Bitter almonds and their fruit aren't safe for eating. Bitter almonds contain prussic acid, a toxic chemical. Just a handful of raw, unprocessed bitter almonds can potentially be deadly.However, it is possible to process bitter almonds with a special toxin-leaching process, rendering them edible.  Winter is the perfect time for pruning — the tree's dormant wood makes for safe, easy removal. Note, however, that dead or diseased limbs should be removed immediately at any time of the year. To prune branches, use a pair of garden clippers to make a clean cut near the bottom of the branch. For tougher pruning jobs, use a saw.          Pruning a tree encourages healthy, even, visually appealing growth. Smart pruning choices can also make a tree stronger, sturdier, and more resistant to certain diseases.When pruning, try to thin out especially dense areas of foliage and eliminate spots where two branches rub against one another. You'll also want to prune any stray branches that grow higher or further to the side than the others to encourage even growth., Almond trees take some time to start producing nuts. Typically, this "waiting" period lasts about five years. However, depending on the species of tree, it can take as long as 12 years for it to reach full nut-producing capacity. Be patient — a mature, healthy tree can produce over 40 pounds of nuts in a single harvest!   Once an almond tree begins bearing fruit, it will do so every year for as long as 50 years, ensuring plenty of almonds for years to come.  It's important to understand that most almond trees don't produce almonds "by default". The fruit of the almond tree (and, thus, the almonds themselves) are usually produced as a response to pollination as a method of sexual reproduction. This means that unless you have a self-pollinating variety of almond tree, you'll need to cross-pollinate your tree with another tree of a different variety to get almonds.          The easiest way to do this is usually just to have multiple trees of different varieties. Once you have two to three trees growing near each other, pollinators like bees will bring pollen from one tree to another as part of their natural behavior. You can also pollinate trees manually by taking a flower-bearing branch from another tree and rubbing it against the first tree's flowers, mixing the tree's pollen in the process. However, this is much more time-intensive and may not work as well as natural pollination.  Grafting will turn an unproductive tree into a productive one if the existing tree is not self-fertile and you graft on a scion from a different variety. Once the graft "sets", the grafted-on part will still have the ability to produce fruit, even if the rest of the tree doesn't. This is how the vast majority of certain crops like oranges are grown.          There are several ways to graft a productive limb onto your tree. The simplest is usually a technique called T-budding that involves making a long, narrow cut on the "host" tree and slipping the new limb into the groove formed. After this, the new limb is secured with string or rubber ties until the host tree accepts it. Note that most grafting is performed in the spring when the material under the bark is moist and green. Keep in mind that grafting will not make an unproductive tree productive if it isn't producing due to poor site selection, lack of nutrients, etc.  Almonds are usually harvested between July and October (in some countries like Saudi Arabia, it starts end of May) once the external fruit has dried and cracked open. Shake the tree and gather the almonds that drop, taking care to throw out any rotten ones you come across. Sometimes, the fruit may fall without the tree being shaken. Unless they begin to rot, these nuts are still edible.          After harvesting, it's a good idea to freeze your almond husks for 1-2 weeks to kill any residual pests., One problem that can affect nearly any tree (including the almond tree) is root rot. This harmful condition is caused mainly by fungi that start to grow on the tree's roots if they're in contact with water for too long. Since root rot can be very tough to treat, the best policy is prevention. Never over-water your tree — any sort of watering that results in standing water around the base of the tree can do much more harm than good.          To help prevent over-watering, you may want to increase the drainage capability of your soil. This can be done by mixing in plenty of extra hummus or organic matter to give it added permeability. Note that shallow, heavy, and clay-rich soils have especially bad drainage. If you have a case of root rot on your hands (usually signified by drought-like symptoms, including yellowing, wilting, and dying leaves), dig up the plant's roots and cut away any dark, slimy patches. If problems persist, dispose of the plant to prevent the fungus from spreading throughout your garden.  Weeds are not a huge concern for old, established almond trees, but they can be a serious threat to young seedlings. Weeds compete fiercely for the same nutrients, water, and sun as young almond trees. If ignored, weeds can even "strangle" a seedling before it has a chance to grow.The best policy for weeds, especially during your plant's first few months, is to start weeding early and often. Try to keep a five or six foot strip along each row of seedlings free of weeds — you can use manual methods (like your hands or garden tools) or herbicides to kill the weeds.You can use a layer of mulch, or landscaping fabric to control weeds. This works well for small, home orchards.  One particularly annoying almond pest is the navel orangeworm. Over the winter, this insect shelters in so-called "mummy" nuts — almonds that aren't harvested and are left on the tree into the late fall and winter. Once the spring rolls around, these grubs become active, resulting in damage to the almond crop. The best way to prevent this is simply to get rid of the mummies. Without any place to shelter over the winter, orangeworms should not appear, as they cannot penetrate healthy fruits later in the year.   After the mummies are removed from the tree, be sure to destroy them by mowing. Orangeworms can still shelter in intact mummies on the ground.  Peach twig borers are just what they sound like — small, grub-like insects that bore into stone fruits like peach and almonds. These insects can cause significant damage to almond crops with their feeding, so if you see these pesky bugs (or chewed-up leaves, which can signal their presence), use a pesticide immediately to protect your crop. Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterial insecticide, is a great choice for killing borers. Time the spray with the spring hatching season to kill the insects before they have a chance to do significant damage.         In addition to the two examples above, a huge variety of additional pests can potentially attack almond trees — so many, in fact, that it's impossible to list them all here. For more information, use a search engine query for "almond pests" or contact your local garden supply store or a local university's botany department. You may also want to learn about integrated pest management. This is a method of controlling pests that combines biological, environmental, and chemical pest management techniques. It is more effective than using one method alone.	Make sure your area has proper almond growing conditions. Purchase seeds or seedlings. Choose a sunny location for the tree. Germinate the seeds. Transplant the sprouts. Water generously. Fertilize in the spring. Harvest nuts in the fall. Prune in early winter. Wait 5 years before expecting fruit. Be sure the tree is pollinated. Graft a different variety onto the tree as an alternative. Harvest the almonds when ripe. Avoid over-watering to prevent root rot. Practice good weed control. Keep the tree free of mummies to fight navel orangeworm. Use Bacillus thuringiensis spray for peach twig borers.
This method is cheap, quick, and easy — perfect if you don't want to spend money on specialty molds for making ice balls. All you'll need is a few round water balloons (and, of course, water and a freezer.)   Remember that, if you're using your ice balls to cool your drinks, they'll need to be able to fit inside your glasses. Thus, when it comes to water balloons, generally, the smaller, the better. ; , If you want color ice balls add two drops of food coloring when you do this. Grab a balloon, open the neck, and slide it over your faucet. Turn the water on at a low level so that it gradually fills the balloon. You want enough water so that you have a small globe that you can easily handle with one hand — this is probably a lot less than you'd use if you were going to have a water balloon fight.   Once again, you'll want to make sure that your ice balls are small enough to fit in whichever glass you plan to use. A good way to check this is to put your glass around the balloon as it fills. Keep in mind that water expands when it freezes, so you want to leave a little extra room on each side., When each balloon is full enough, remove it from the faucet and tie it off. Use tight knots — having a leaky balloon in your freezer can lead to an icy mess.  Now comes the easy part — waiting. Simply leave your water balloons in the fridge until they are frozen all the way through. For the most round shapes, don't pack the balloons into a container — they will push against each other and create oblong-shaped pieces of ice. Instead, give each balloon its own space on a plastic tray or baking sheet so that none are touching.   Note that, even with this precaution, ice balls made using this method won't be perfectly round. Instead, they'll have one side that's a little flattened (the side of the balloon that it was resting on.)  , Once your ice balls are completely frozen, they're ready to use. Simply use a knife or a pair of scissors to cut the balloon off each one and drop the (mostly) spherical pieces of ice into your drink. Voila!	Buy a package of water balloons. Fill your balloons with enough water to make small spheres. Tie the balloons. Leave the balloons in the fridge. Pop and peel off the balloon before using each ball.
With your hands even with your chest, rest your body on the ground, Keep your shoulders back and your hips forward to do the worm. Make sure you've stretched your back before attempting it., One of the most important parts of the move is keeping your toes curled in, so you can use them to push and create the distinctive "wave" that starts the move. You can't push up if your toes are pointed straight back. Use them to grip and push yourself up and forward once you've kicked.  Lift your feet so the bottoms of your feet are pointing straight up toward the sky. Practice donkey-kicking up and back to get your hips off the ground. This is the easiest way to get the move started, but takes some practice to get the physics of it right.  To try the first motion, kick your legs up and back. With your hips off the ground, push up with your hands as you would to do a regular push-up. Let your feet come down first and let your hips, stomach, and chest roll back forward to the push-up position. This will send that wave-like motion through your body.   Get the rhythm down and practice getting more of your body off the ground with each kick.  It's important to remember that the move starts from your toes. Keep them curled in and land with your toes ready to immediately push off again. Chain several of these 'kick-and-push' moves together to do the worm.  Once you've got the basic motion down, you can change the way the move starts, how many times you do it, and how high. You can also start the worm from a kneeling position by rolling forward from your knees and kicking up and back when you roll all the way forward onto your hands.   Try a backward worm by starting from a standing position. Put your hands on the ground and kick your legs up in the air as if you were about to do a handstand. Instead, let your body lower to the ground by rolling from the chest to the stomach and the hips. When your toes touch, push off as you normally would and push-up with your hands again. Your momentum should carry you in the opposite direction.	Go into a basic push-up position. Curl your toes in. Bring your legs up at a 90 degree angle. Kick and push. Land back on your toes. Try variations.
Obtaining the exact amount of money owed on your car loan will allow you to make financial plans regarding paying off the loan. If you do online banking, this information can be found under your account summary. Alternately, you can review your mailed monthly statement.; , You can request this from your financial institution in person or by logging in to your personal account on your lender's website. Speak directly with a loan adviser or review the terms and conditions of your loan to determine if penalties apply for paying the car loan off quickly.   Some banks or financial institutions may charge you fees or penalties for paying off the car loan sooner than the original life of the loan, especially if you cause them to lose money in interest. These are typically called "prepayment penalties."  , You can find online loan payoff calculators at Bankrate.com or MortgageLoan.com where you can plug in your loan's interest rate, monthly payment and payoff amount. Then you will be able to compare how much you can save by paying the car off in one lump sum, making payments twice a month, or increasing the amount of your monthly payments.If there are penalties for paying off your car loan early, compare the savings you calculated with the amount of the penalties. Then you will know if you will save money by paying off your loan early.  Your loan adviser may be able to educate you on the most beneficial way for you to pay off your car loan faster, especially if penalties apply. For example, ask your lender if they can decrease the balance of your car loan if you can pay the remaining balance in one lump sum.In some cases, lenders may lower the remaining balance of your car loan substantially if you can pay off the remaining balance with just one payment.  Some lenders may only charge you a fixed monthly interest, which can allow you to apply additional payments toward the principal amount. However, other lenders may charge you interest on every payment you make. Ask your lender if you can make additional payments toward the principal amount of the loan without having to pay interest. If so, you can plan to make small, additional payments toward the loan each month and pay less in interest over the life of the loan.   An example of the difference between the kinds of interest you pay is: if you have a $100 payment due every month with $4 interest that means you pay $104 per month. What you need to find out is if that $4 is a fixed amount per month, which would mean no matter how much you might pay on the principal ($100, $200, $300) you still pay just $4 monthly interest. If, however, they charge interest on every payment, you would end up paying 4% interest on whatever you are putting down on the principal -- $8 if you chose to pay $200 instead of $100, for example. Even if you have to pay interest on each payment, it is usually worth your while to make extra principal payments to pay your loan off faster.  Use a check or pay online to make an extra payment per month, that is separate from your regular car loan payment. Write “Principal Only” on the check so that the lender will not count it toward your loan payment for the next month.If you are paying online, pay the extra principal amount before you are billed for the next month.  Instead of making one monthly payment, split it in half and make payments every two weeks. This typically works out to twice per month, but by the end of the year you will have made two more biweekly payments (one full payment) because most months are longer than an exact 4 weeks. In other words, make 26 half payments per year (every other week for 52 weeks) that will equal 13 full payments, rather than the 12 you would've otherwise paid. This means that the total amount you owe will go down faster, saving you interest on the loan., Extra income such as tax refunds, bonuses from your job, or cash gifts from birthdays or holidays could be applied to your car loan, resulting in a faster payoff. You will be paying more in interest on your car loan than you would earn in a savings or money market account., If you have the time outside your normal work hours, consider starting a side business in order to generate additional money to pay down your car loan. Examples of side businesses are:   Rent out a room in your home. This could be for a student or someone staying in your town temporarily for a job. You can advertise this on your local craigslist.com. Mow lawns and/or shovel snow. Run errands for elderly people or busy professionals. Buy china, artwork, tools, jewelry, books, etc. for low prices at estate sales and flea markets and then sell them on eBay. Offer at-home party sales. Check out Tupperware, Pampered Chef, Longaberger baskets, Silpada jewelry, Mary Kay cosmetics, Cabi clothing and The Happy Gardener. If you organize a sales team you’ll be able to reap a percent of their profits as well.  If you have paid off one of your credit cards, for example, continue to pay that former monthly amount toward your car loan. Then you won't be tempted to spend it on other things.  Make a list of your monthly income and expenses, including expenses that occur only once or twice a year. Then you will be able to see if you have extra cash at the end of the month to pay down your car loan. If you don't have extra cash, look for areas where you can cut expenses.Eliminate expenses you do not need such as cable television channels or a landline telephone. The money you apply to costs such as these can be applied toward your car loan instead. Seek lower rates on mandatory expenses and bills such as auto insurance, internet bills, or cell phone bills by consulting with each of your service providers for bundled or promotional rates. You can get auto insurance quotes online to compare to your current policy. Lower your food expenses by cooking or preparing meals at home rather than eating out in restaurants. In most cases, a specific meal will cost significantly more if you purchase it from a restaurant than if you buy the meal or ingredients from a grocery store.  Banks will often have much better deals than car dealerships, so look at the loans offered at your bank. Talk to a bank employee about how the loans work, how much interest and what kind they charge, and if there are prepayment penalties. If you choose to take out a car loan with your bank, make sure to take the information about the bank and the loan to the car dealership so that they have the information.  Now that you've learned how to pay off a car loan faster, you know how detrimental it is if there are prepayment penalties. There are many choices of where to take out a car loan, so next time make sure you choose a financial institution that does not require prepayment penalties.  The fastest way to pay off a loan is to not take one out in the first place. If you were paying $300 a month for your car loan and the loan is now paid off, continue to put this amount in a savings or money market account. Then when you are ready to buy your next car you can pay in cash for a large down payment or the entire amount.  If you have started to make and follow a budget while cutting expenses, keep up these good habits. Put any money you save into a money market account to earn interest. Or if you don't plan on buying a new car for 3-5 years, you could invest this money in a certificate of deposit (CD). Then you will be able to make a large down payment or not have to take out a loan for your next car.	Determine the exact payoff amount of your car loan. Obtain a copy of your bank or loan agreement. Calculate savings as a result of making extra payments. Consult with your financial institution for loan payoff recommendations. Determine if you can make additional payments to the principal balance only. Make a separate payment for principal. Make biweekly payments. Apply extra earnings or cash gifts to your car loan. Earn extra income. Use the snowball technique. Establish a budget and minimize extra expenses. Ask about car loans at your bank. Don't take out a car loan with prepayment penalties. Continue paying yourself the monthly car payment. Continue to budget and cut expenses.
Kompa dancing is done in pairs, generally male and female. Many of the maneuvers in this style of dance are intimate, so be sure it is with a person you are comfortable with.; , While facing one another and standing straight, the man then places his right hand under the shoulder blade of his partner and intertwines her free hand with his own. The left arm must be at the height of the shoulders. The woman’s left hand must be placed at the top of her partner’s shoulder blade.  One of the more important steps to Kompa dancing is hip movement. Slightly bend your right knee and pick up your right foot as you move your hips toward that direction. When swaying to the right and hitting that step, simultaneously slightly bend the left knee and pick up the left foot while shifting your hips toward that direction. Doing this will help you build a rhythm.  While doing the same hip movement, move closer to your partner with the man now placing his right hand on his partner’s side, under her armpit and close to her breast. The woman places her entire left arm around her partner and places her left hand on her partner’s left shoulder blade. Doing this will create a stronger sense of guidance and direction for you and your partner.  Now that you and your partner have the hang of the first few steps, now it is time to get out of a stationary position. While doing the previous steps, move in a rhythmic pace frontward and backward. Be sure to move your leg simultaneously with your partner’s opposite leg. (If they move their left leg, move your right).  This step all depends on the chemistry your partner and you have with each other. While doing all the previously mentioned steps, add moving in a circular motion with your partner to it.	Find a partner. Grab each other and position your bodies. Sway the hips from side to side. Get closer. Move back and forth. Add a turn (optional).
A common goal to improve your overall health is to ditch the sugary drinks and increase water intake. This is a great goal as water is essential to your hydration and health.Increasing water consumption is a virtually free and painless way to instantly make a positive change for yourself.   Your long-term goal should be to drink about 64 oz or 2 L of clear, sugar-free fluids every day.Ditch sweetened beverages. Drinking more water is great, but skipping the sweetened beverages will help reduce your overall calorie intake and promote weight loss.If you're not drinking a lot of water now, start slowly. Add in one glass or one bottle of water every day. Or, swap out one soda or one energy drink for an equivalent amount of water. Slowly increase the amount of water you drink and decrease a number of sweetened beverages you drink. Don't drink your fruits. Give up drinking fruit juice and get all those wonderful nutrients from real, whole fruit. You'll get the added benefit of having the fiber from the fruit in addition to missing out on the liquid calories of fruit juice.  While you are increasing the amount of water you drink, you can also be strategic about when you drink it. Drinking a big glass of water (about eight oz) right before a meal or snack can help decrease your overall portion size and how many calories you consume.Try to make it a habit to drink water right before you eat. When you're stomach is more full on water, it can help decrease your hunger. This may lead to or help support your weight loss. You can also consume other no-calorie beverages including: sugar-free, flavored waters, coffee, tea, no-calorie sports drinks, and even low sodium broth.  Eating enough fruits and vegetables is key for a healthy lifestyle and diet since these foods are essential sources of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. However, eating the recommended seven to nine servings of fruits and vegetables everyday may be daunting or difficult.If you're not a big fruit or vegetable eater, make a list of your top five favorite fruits and vegetables. Start by adding in just one serving of fruit or vegetables a day. As you get comfortable with this goal, add two servings a day. If you dislike a variety of fruits and vegetables, go to the grocery and pick out something new or unfamiliar to you. Or try an item that you haven't had in a while. Keep fresh fruit on the counter and vegetables cut, washed, and ready to eat in the fridge. The less preparation needed, the more likely you'll include them in your diet. If you enjoy a sweet after dinner, try having fruit with your dessert.  Whole grains are minimally processed grains that are higher in fiber, protein, and other nutrients compared to refined grains (like white bread or plain pasta).They also have a more nutty flavor and chewy texture which may not be enjoyable by all people.   If you typically eat mostly refined grains, start with making about half of your grain choices whole grains. As you get more comfortable with this goal, you can work up to making most or all of your grain choices whole grains. Whole grain foods to try include: 100% whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice or 100% whole wheat bread. Try a variety of whole grains and a variety of brands of whole grains. For example, try 100% whole wheat pasta. If you don't like it, try another brand of 100% whole wheat pasta as each brand has a slightly different flavor.  Making lifestyle changes to be healthier doesn't mean you can't enjoy a snack. In fact, having a snack can help manage and control hunger and support weight loss.Healthy snacks should contain some lean protein and a fruit or a vegetable. However, start slowly changing your snacks for a lasting change. For example, if you normally have a small bag of chips in the afternoon try swapping to a small bag of whole grain chips with salsa.  Studies show that packing your lunch can help cut down on your overall calorie intake (and food costs).Brown-bagging your lunch will give you more control over what foods you eat and how they're prepared.   If you typically eat lunch out everyday, start by packing your lunch just one to two days a week. Also pack an afternoon snack if you typically stop by the vending machine to grab an afternoon pick-me-up.	Drink more water. Drink water before a meal. Eat a fruit and vegetable every day. Choose whole grains most of the time. Eat healthy snacks. Pack your lunch.
Therefore, some of the things you do to break in tap shoes might seem similar to these tips.; , This is to prevent a lot of blisters from coming. You are still going to get blisters, just not as much as you would without the Vaseline. , Just do maybe five to ten in a row. Sevens work too, if you would rather. These exercises will help increase the wideness of your hard shoe.  Make sure you rub at the sides and the front and backs.  Walk up and down the stairs about three to five times. Remember to walk at a very fast pace.  Once again, every Irish step dancer knows what this movement is. Repeatedly, do these exercises about ten to fifteen times.  You can leave it overnight. This will help make it easier to go en pointe.  You could do any one you want, as long as it will make your shoes feel "worn." This will probably give you blisters, but it's essential.  Once you are comfortable standing in three-quarters pointe (with just the balls of your feet on the ground), you should begin working towards a toe stand, if they are allowed for your age group. Begin by holding onto a surface at waist height such as a desk or a sturdy chair. Go into full pointe on one foot and pick the other up off the ground while using the desk for support. (It's okay if you have to bend your knee, but as your hard shoes become more broken in, try to straighten it more and more.) Meanwhile, repeatedly tap the heel of your standing foot with the toe of your standing foot. This will help give your shoe the flexibility you need to do a toe stand. Switch feet and do the same exercise on the other foot.	First things first, a hard shoe is like a tap dancing shoe, but it is a little more expensive and instead of metal it has fiber-glass or resin tips. Apply some Vaseline to the inside edge of your hard shoe where your heel will be. Walk around.Since your hard shoe is now on, walk up and down stairs, walk around the house, but do not walk outside, the concrete will ruin the leather sole.  , Start doing hop two threes.Every Irish step dancer know what a hop two three is. If your feet are starting to hurt, take a break and start rubbing the inside of your hard shoe. After rubbing, apply some more Vaseline, and put your hard shoes back on, because it is time to do more exercises. Hop, hop back, hop back two three four. Bend your hard shoe in half and put it under the couch. Once you have done everything here, try to dance. Toe stand practice.
You could grow them from seed yourself, but in all honesty, the tobacco seeds are almost microscopic and they are difficult to germinate successfully. Get some starter plants off eBay or something.; ,,, Place the plants in each row no less than two feet apart.  You may need to fertilize, but keep the chemicals to a minimum.  The flower is where seeds are produced and leaving the flower on the plant will stunt it's growth. You must remove the flower.   After about four months of growing, your plants should be mature.  You can stake them upside down in a traditional fashion and leave them to dry like that in the sun for a few days, but I did not. I washed mine and hung them upside down in my garage where it was about 80 degrees. I left them hanging for about two months until they turned golden brown.  The top leaves are supposedly the sweetest with the lower leaves being harsher. I discard the lowest row of leaves, but I believe this to be personal preference.  The leaves will be flaked once processed. The tobacco may or may not smell like the tobacco you are accustomed to buying from the store, but it is still tobacco and it smokes great.  You can expect to get about one half of a coffee container per plant.	Locate a nursery or person who grows tobacco plants from seed. Put your starter plants in cups with some good potting soil and leave them in the sun for a week or two, watering them daily/as needed until they have accepted their new environment.  , Till your garden.  , Plant the tobacco plants in rows where the rows are three feet apart. Water and maybe use some Miracle Grow and keep an eye on them as they take hold and grow. When the flower develops on the top of the plant, you need to cut it off. Cut them down. Be as selective as you like as to which leaves to pull from the plants. Once you've picked all of the dried leaves you wish to harvest, simply run them through a food processor. You can store your tobacco in leftover three pound coffee containers.
Select a location that is similar to where the plants would grow in the wild. For instance, primrose grows along banks and rocky ridges, while Columbine prefers the shade of trees.   The size of the growing area is entirely up to you. It is best if you can set it aside to grow wild once the seeds have been sown, so perhaps consider placing it away from areas of the garden, yard or land that are frequently tended, such as lawns and vegetable plots.; , When you grow a natural garden, it is best to select flowers that are local to your area.   Visit a local nature preserve to find out what types of wildflowers flourish in your area. Bring a notebook with you so you can write down names of flowers you enjoy, and note what flowers grow well together. Find information about natural gardening online, at the library, or at your local nursery store.  Purchasing wildflower seeds at a nursery, online or garden shop will ensure that you receive fertile and ready-to-grow seeds.  When you grow a natural garden, you need to get the soil ready for the seeds. Clear out the vegetation where you want to create your garden. Use a hoe. , When you grow a natural garden, it needs to have nourishing soil. , Then plant them in the other direction to ensure adequate coverage when you create a natural garden.  When you create a garden with wildflowers, you don't want the seeds planted too deep, because they may not develop.  This will help to stop birds eating them. After a good amount of growth has happened (around 2 to 5 months), you can lift up the netting and let it grow., The seeds should start sprouting within two weeks, and then you may need to water them occasionally, especially during the driest months of summer.  Mow the flower garden once after the flowers have seeded and just before spring. You should then have a patch full of color and habitat., Lift up a new area of turf next to the existing growing area and throw in additional wildflower seeds collected from the existing flowers. Doing this will ensure that the wildflowers spread and grow well.	Decide where to create a garden with wildflowers. Determine what types of wildflowers you want to plant. Obtain wildflower seeds. Prepare the soil. Till or rake the dirt about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep.  , Mix in some potting soil with a hoe, to enrich the garden dirt.Plant your wildflower seeds in the spring when all danger of frost has passed. Sprinkle the seeds evenly in 1 direction. Press the seeds into the soil with a garden roller or gently walk on them with your feet, rather than burying the seeds. If needed, net off the place where you have sown the seeds. Water your wildflower seeds, being careful not to drown them. Mow the land area only after flowers have seeded. Start over the following spring.
It is designed to catch water that gets through the sunroof. Wipe it with a cloth to remove any visible debris on the seals and edges of the sunroof.; , These are very small holes, usually at the corners of the sunroof just under the seal.  These tubes are designed to carry water that gets through the roof down and out of the car. Tubes can get blocked with dirt and debris over time and need cleaning.	Clean the sunroof trough, located just inside the rubber seal. Locate the sunroof drain tubes. Blast compressed air through the drain tubes located at the base of the sunroof seal.
Just assume from now on that at the beginning of every dance, your right toe is pointed in front, your left foot is pointed outward, and your shoulders low and back, hands at your side.  Then, point your left foot and put it in back. When you "put it in back," put it in the same opening foot position -- closed and crossed.  That's a lifted knee on 1 (the right knee) and walking (on your toes) for 2,3,4,5,6, and 7. On 7, place your left foot solid on the ground.   When you lift your knee, really lift your knee and keep your toe pointed. The more exaggerated you feel, the better it probably looks.  This takes up an 8-count. Start again with your right foot, taking 4 counts. If you say it aloud, "point" is on 1, "back" is on 3, with silence on 4. For the left foot, point on 5, back on 7.  Again with the right knee, lift it high and place it down in front of your left foot. The "step in" serves as a ball change; when you place your right foot down on "step," shift your weight to your left foot on "in." When your weight is on your left, point your right foot forward and bring it back to conclude the step.   Once you get the basics down, make it "hoppy." There should be a livelihood to your points and knee lifts that makes it seem like you're sort of jumping. With every accented step, add a small hop on your back foot.	Assume the opening position. Point your right foot and put it in back. Lift your knee and walk in place for a seven. Point and put it in back once more for each leg. Lift up your knee, step in, and point in back to finish.
If you are the partner or principle guest of the mother, make sure you are ready to assist her during delivery with helpful tips, reminders, and encouragement.   A childbirth preparation class will teach you the stages of delivery, options for pain management, breathing techniques, assistance tips you can use as a guest during birth, and even what to bring with you to the delivery.  If you have been invited to attend the delivery of a child, it may help to learn how labor and delivery function.   Knowing the basics of what the mother is experiencing and how labor is expected to progress can help you calm the mother, prepare yourself for the sight of blood, and inform you of how long you can expect to be on your toes as a guest.  Many times, labor can begin hours before delivery occurs; as a guest, you may wish to think of strategies for keeping the mother pleasantly occupied during dilation.   Write down a list of things to discuss or safe activities to do while she is waiting to begin delivery. Suggestions include talking about future vacations, taking a walk, giving her a massage, listening to music, taking a bath (you may wish to pack a swimsuit), sitting on an exercise ball to relieve discomfort, watching the mother’s favorite movie on your laptop, and other low-stress activities to kill time and calm everyone’s nerves.	Consider attending a childbirth preparation class with the mother. Learn the biology of birth. Prepare ideas of what to do during the waiting period.
If water and mild detergent are not effective, you can use a pressure washer to remove tough stains from a stamped concrete surface. Pressure washing can help remove tire marks, leaf stains, and grease spots. Try renting a pressure washer at your local hardware store., An alkaline degreaser can help lift stains like oil and grease to the surface of stamped concrete. Use the degreaser with hot water. Make sure you follow all directions on the degreaser label., If your stamped concrete has a rust stain, you might be able to remove it using a cleaner with oxalic acid. Make sure you consult the company that installed or manufactured your stamped concrete before deciding to use oxalic acid.	Consider pressure washing outdoor surfaces. Try using an alkaline degreaser to remove oil, grease, or soot. Use oxalic acid to remove rust.
You need to know what's happening, so that you understand why your character is saying what you are saying. Do you have trouble with your character? Can you not read the lines clearly? Ask a friend for help.   Get into character. If you don't know what that means, it means to be the person/creature you're playing, walk, talk, look, like the part you're playing; then, you will make it more realistic.; , You should practice doing it as it would be done in real life, on stage or in a studio. In the performance it won't be done in your head.   Ask a family member or a friend to help you learn them, reading along with what you are saying and to catch skipped or wrong emphasis on words.  If you know your lines -- but you don't know when to say them -- you're going to struggle. Know the last bit of the previous person's lines or the events leading to yours; so that you know when to say your lines.  It will make it more realistic, and it will also help you with your performance skills.  Take a few lines at a time. One time you can look at one scene, and then split the scene up into groups of lines. Learn a few lines at a time and keep going over them -- even if you know them. Going over them again will make you feel confident.  If you see a big speech, split that into smaller parts and you will be able to learn it. It might be really cool if you have a lot of lines, just make sure you learn them all, to do them with real feeling.  Acting is work, but it can also be a lot of fun. If you enjoy doing it, you will be able to excel in it a lot easier. You will be able to learn the lines easier if you are enjoying it, otherwise, you will be bored and not able to concentrate on it for long.  It is very important that you take a breaks, preferably after a set amount of time. The amount of time you can work before having a break will vary with the individual, but it doesn't matter whether other people can work longer than you. Everyone is different!  , Always have a drink of water with you. It will really help you concentrate if you have a drink of water. Also, it may help if you have sweets or candy with you. If you get stressed, then stop for a minute, have some sweets and continue.  When you are walking or driving somewhere you have to go to anyway, practice some lines. Incorporate the practice in your daily routine. Practice in front of the mirror. Look at yourself. Find out which expression works best with your character. Have your lines close to be able to quickly glance over them for help.  This step should be practiced at least five weeks before the performance. Have your friend or friends read certain parts as you try to remember you lines to respond. Don't use your playbook for this step.  Use wardrobe and put makeup on for this step.	Read the play and understand it. Walk around a room while you are saying the lines out loud. Know your cues. Perform your parts of the play while you are learning your lines. Split it up. Don't be overwhelmed at the amount of lines you need to learn. Have fun. Take breaks. Drink plenty of water. Say the lines to yourself during your daily routine. Use a friend to help you. Make a schedule with the rest of the cast to practice.
Keep watering until water leaks out through the drain hole at the bottom of the pot.You shouldn't have to water your herbs more than once or twice a week.If you water too often, the soil will become waterlogged. This can lead to root rot, which can kill your herbs.  Every herb is different, so you might want to read the seed packet, or the label that came with your herb. In general, however, most types of herbs need 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day.A bright, sunny window would be ideal. If you live in a place that gets very little sunlight, consider getting a UV lamp for your herbs.   Consider rotating the pots every 4 to 5 days. This will help the herbs grow straight up, instead of bent to the side., Water, sunlight, and potting soil are not enough to grow healthy herbs. You will need to fertilize them every once in a while. When buying a fertilizer, make sure that you get something that promotes healthy leaves instead of pretty flowers. After all, you eat the leaves of herbs, and not their flowers., This will help them produce more leaves. When harvesting, make sure that you leave a few inches of stem on the plant. This will allow the plant to continue to grow. You also want to avoid taking the large leaves. These leaves capture the most sunlight, and aid the plant with photosynthesis.Many herbs will produce flowers. You will want to pinch these off, so that the herb can focus on producing tasty leaves rather than pretty blooms.The one exception to this is chamomile; the flower itself is the herb. Pick leafy herbs, such as basil, right at the top of the stem.Snip delicate herbs, such as cilantro and parsley, closer to the base of the stem.Trim woody herbs, such as rosemary, with scissors or garden shears.	Water only when the top layer of the soil is dry. Make sure that your herbs get enough sunlight. Don't forget to feed your herbs. Remember to prune and harvest your herbs.
You will need 1¾ yards (1.6 meters) of fleece fabric, about 44 to 45 inches (1.2 meters) wide. Plaid patterns work best with this, but a solid color will also look nice.Make sure that you are using flannel and not fleece. Fleece does not fray the same way flannel does. For a larger blanket, opt for a 2-yard (1.8-meter) piece of fabric instead.; , This blanket will only have a fringe on the narrow edges. The long edges will be left alone for a finished look. Take a look at the long edges of your fabric, and trim off any stray threads. You won't be hemming them because the salvage already takes care of that.If you want to have a fringe on all four sides, cut the selvage edges off., Choose a thread color that matches your fabric, and sew across the narrow sides, 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) from the edge. Use a short stitch length. This will keep the fabric from fraying past the fringe.If you want to have a fringe on all four sides, sew around the blanket using a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance. Turn the fabric at the corners so that you sew in one continuous line.If you want a longer fringe, leave a larger seam allowance.  Cut the slits from the narrow edges of the fabric so that they are aligned with the selvage edge. This will make the proceeding steps easier.Be careful not to cut through your stitching!   If you want your blanket to have a fringe on all four sides, cut a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) square into each of the corners. Be careful not to cut through your stitching. This will make it easier to pull the threads out. If you want to make a longer fringe, cut longer slits/bigger squares.  Be careful not the pull the actual stitching threads out, however. You are only pulling the threads that make up the fabric out. The easiest way to do this would be to grab a thread or two with a seam ripper and then pulling it out. Keep doing this until you reach the stitching you made.   Be sure to pull the threads out from the notch you cut into the selvage edge. Do not fray the rest of the selvage. Run your fingers through the fringe when you are done. This will loosen up the fringe and get rid of any residual fuzz.	Choose your fabric. Clean the selvage edges up. Sew across the narrow edges of your blanket. Cut 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) slits into the selvage edges. Pull the threads out of the fabric until you reach your stitching.
Cook with citrus in the spring, berries in summer and apples and pumpkin in the fall. Food prepared at the peak of its freshness has unbeatable flavor and nutritional value.; , Instead, choose healthy ways to enhance the flavor of fruit in your cooking. For example, serve baked apples with frozen yogurt, cinnamon, walnuts and dried cranberries; or add balsamic vinegar to strawberries to bring out their natural sweetness.  Fruit juice and dried fruit, when used in moderation, is a healthy addition to many meals. Cook a dish like Moroccan chicken with dried plums to boost the fiber content of the dish, or use freshly squeezed orange juice to give a citrus kick to a salad dressing.  Applesauce is a great substitute for vegetable oil in muffin and bread recipes. You’ll have to do some research to calculate just how much fat you can replace with fruit in your recipes, but the fruit can add the same moisture to your dishes without making your fingers greasy, so it’s worth it.	Use fresh, local fruit that is in season. Avoid adding table sugar to fruit dishes. Don’t forget juices and dried fruits. Use fruit purees in place of fat when baking.
In order to lengthen the life of your cut flowers, you need to make sure that the container you keep them in is as clean as possible and free from any bacteria that might kill off your flowers early. Usually, scrubbing the vase with warm water and mild detergent is adequate, but if you know that previous flowers in the vase had a disease or if the vase looks especially dirty, use bleach. Scrub the inside using a bottle brush and follow by soaking it.   If your vase is dishwasher safe, you can also run it on a normal dishwashing cycle. You should verify that the vase can withstand such hot water before attempting it, however.; , Your garden shears will be the first surface to come into contact with the delicate interior of the freshly cut stems, making it essential that they are clean and free from harmful bacteria. Wipe the blades using a rag soaked in a little bleach or alcohol. Rinse the sterilized blades under hot water.  Roses last longest when they are cut immediately after the bud stage, when the petals are starting to open. Rose varieties with many petals, such as the Moonstone variety, should be cut at a more open stage, while rose varieties with fewer petals, like the Silverado, should be cut closer to the bud stage.  Then, that night, give the rose bush a thorough watering, drenching the soil completely so that the roses have plenty to drink. The more water your roses absorb by the following morning, the longer the roses will last after being cut.  Anytime from daybreak to 10:00 AM should work, but after that point, the weather begins heating up too much. Hot, sunny weather deprives your roses of substance, drying them out and making them weaker. On especially hot days, you should make it a point to cut your roses as early as possible.   Alternatively, you can also cut your roses in the evening. If the roses are watered in the morning or if they receive a great deal of morning dew, cutting them in the evening, after the weather has cooled and the roses have had a chance to recover, can also work sufficiently well.  Using your clean shears, cut the rose stems at roughly a 45 degree angle. Cutting the roses at an angle prevents the stems from resting flat in the vase, which could prevent them from drinking all the water they need, resulting in an early death. Cut the stems low to the ground, leaving plenty of stem to work with for you to resize appropriately later on.  This does not need to be your vase. Instead, you should use a bucket with a large enough opening for you to work inside. All further cutting should be done inside this bucket of water to prevent air bubbles or embolisms from emerging inside the stems.  Bacteria and rot can fester in leaves the sit in still water. You still need to leave the foliage above the water line, approximately the top half to the top third, intact. Otherwise, the roses will be unable to draw up water.  Make an angled cut underwater, similar the first. This cut will determine the final length of the stems and the final height of your roses. Temporarily remove the flowers from your bucket of water and measure them against the side of the vase to determine where to make the necessary cut. Once you have chosen the spot, return the flowers to the bucket and cut them beneath the water.  Use warm water. You can either use commercial rose food or make your own plant food by using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) vinegar, 1 tsp (5 ml) sugar, and 3 to 5 drops of household bleach per 1 liter (1 quart) of water.Bleach is especially useful in preventing harmful bacteria from attacking the freshly cut roses. Thoroughly dissolve the plant food before adding the roses.  Transfer the roses into your vase and sit the vase in a cool, dark room so that the water can thoroughly nourish the roses. Do not allow the blooms to get wet, however.  The roses must chill at approximately 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) for at least two hours or until you are ready to gift them or display them.  If possible, change the water daily to rid the roses' environment of bacteria. Frequently changed fresh water will help make the roses last longer.   Avoid using softened water that contains salt since salt can hurt your roses.	Clean the vase you plan to put the roses in. Clean the shears. Choose the right roses. Water the roses.If possible, make sure you know which morning you will cut your roses on the night before. Cut the roses in the early morning. Cut the roses to remove them from the bush. Move the cut roses to a bucket of warm water. Cut off leaves below the water line. Make a second cut. Fill your vase with water and plant food. Allow the roses to sit in the conditioned water for one hour. Transfer the roses into the refrigerator. Change the water frequently.
Standing outside of the shower area, take a hair brush and go through your hair a few times. Gather any loose hairs in your hands and throw them away before stepping into the shower. This will minimize the number of hairs that may fall out and clog your drain., If you wash your dog or cat in the bath, then give them a good brush down elsewhere beforehand. Try to get off the matted areas and any clumps of loose hair before putting them under the water. In addition, if your dog is muddy, try to remove any larger chunks of dirt before bathing.To minimize the strain on your drain, when the weather is warm you might want to bathe your pets outside instead, if possible.  As you run your hands through your wet hair, place the hair strands that end up on your hands on the wall or the shower ledge. This is better than letting them go on down the drain. When you step out of the shower or bath, wipe up these hairs with your hands or a paper towel and toss them in the trash.Make sure to gather up the hairs after every shower or bath or you could end up creating a hairball that could lodge in your drain.  Debris, such as make-up pieces or clumps of dirt, can partially block the drain. When combined with hairs, this can then develop into a full clog. Be extra careful when putting on your make-up above the bathroom sink, for example. Placing extra screens on all drains can help to minimize these seemingly random clogs., Always let the water run for an extra minute or so after you step out of the shower or bath. This flushes any debris further down the pipes and helps to prevent a clog close to the drain. It is also a good idea to flush your bathroom sink with water as well since toothpaste and other products can clog the pipes otherwise.	Brush your hair beforehand. Remove any excess dirt from pets before washing. Gather any loose hair mid-showering. Avoid putting foreign objects in the drain. Run the water after finishing.
Hold the spray paint can at least one to two inches (2.5-5cm) away from the carpet for consistent coverage without over-painting.   Avoid shaking the can over the area you want to paint to prevent the paint from splashing or splattering.       Run the paint over the carpet in a smooth, even fashion. If the first pass is too light, repeat the step until you're satisfied with the coverage.       Dab any puddled paint on painter’s tape with a rag. You don’t want to have puddled tape dry on the tape as when you peel it away it could not only stick to the carpet, some paint could not be fully dry and spill on other areas of the carpet.  Make sure you are fully satisfied with the section you are painting before moving forward.  This may take some time, but doing it the right way will be worth the wait.   Be sure you lay painter's tape on fully dried paint. During the second or third phase of the painting, you may be laying painter’s tape on previously painted area. Never place tape on a painted area unless completely dry or you risk compromising the integrity of the previously painted area.  Typical dry time is anywhere from eight to 10 hours depending upon the climate and humidity levels.	Paint the carpet. Work from one end of the carpet to the other end. Allow the paint to dry before adding a new color to your design. Wait until the rug is completely dry before using.
Replace your right-hand needle with a similarly-sized crochet hook. This method is very similar to the standard cast-off, but many people find working with a crochet hook faster and easier. Additionally, this method requires no additional yarn other than a short tail, in case you misjudged length or are otherwise in a bind. , Slide the hook underneath the first two loops on the needle. Remove them from the needle onto your crochet hook. Slide the hoops down so that they rest on the straight part of the tool rather than the hook itself.  With either your fingers or knitting tools, carefully take the second loop and bring it up over the first. Remove the second stitch from the crochet hook while leaving the first.  You should now have two loops on the hook. Repeat the previous step with these two stitches. Continue this process with each loop that remains on your needle. Pull the small tail of yarn through the last stitch to finish.	Finish your entire project, including the last row. Pick up two stitches with the crochet hook. Pull the second stitch over the first. Transfer the next stitch from the needle to the crochet hook.
How long the wires are will depend on how big you want your cloud to be. You will be folding these wires into a ring, so keep this in mind. Make sure that all of the wires are the same length.; , Take your first wire, and overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Twist the ends to hold the ring together. Repeat this step for the other wires.  Hold one right horizontally. Hold the other ring above it, vertically. Slight the vertical ring into the horizontal one halfway. Your two rings will make a cross.  You can do this by putting beads of hot glue on the joints between the two rings. You can also tie the joints together with some more wire. Be sure to tuck any sharp ends into the wire "orb."  , Slip the third ring over your frame at a left angle. Secure it to the joints between the other rings with hot glue or more wire. Repeat this step with the fourth ring, but insert it at a right angle. These two new rings should form an X.  Pull off a long strip of polyester stuffing. Draw a squiggle of hot glue across it, then wrap it over your frame. Make sure that it covers at least two rings.   Work quickly. Hot glue sets fast.  Keep doing this until most of your frame is covered. Be careful not to wrap the frame too tightly, or your will distort it.  Once you have most of your cloud covered, pull out smaller tufts of polyester. Draw a swirl of hot glue, then press it against the cloud.  If your cloud looks too much like a ball, gently pull here and there on the tufts to bring them out. This will make your orb look more lumpy and cloud–like than like cotton candy. Don't pull too much, however, of the polyester stuffing won't hold together.  Cut a long piece of fishing line. Dig through your cloud until you find a joint between two wire rings. Tie the fishing line to the joint.  Get some tape and tape your hanging cloud to the ceiling. For a stronger hold, screw a ceiling hook into your ceiling. Tie a loop into the end of the fishing line. Slip the loop over the ceiling hook.	Cut four strands of wire with wire cutters. Twist the wires into rings. Tuck the first ring into the second one, crosswise. Secure the cross. Add the other two rings to form an X and complete your frame. Hot glue polyester stuffing to the wire frame. Continue hot gluing polyester stuffing to the frame. Fill in the gaps with smaller tufts of polyester stuffing. Fluff the cloud out. Tie a piece of fishing line to your cloud. Attach the cloud to the ceiling. Finished.
Not only will you learn a lot about the craft, but you will also make connections with others that are interested in making movies. You may even be able to find work on a film crew through your classmates or professors.Many community colleges offer courses in film that you could sign up for if you aren’t ready to enroll in film school.; , People on film crews sometimes have varied backgrounds, such as in writing, theatre, or art. Consider taking classes in these subjects to broaden your knowledge and prepare you for becoming a filmmaker.  You should watch a variety of movies to get ideas and tips for your own film. Choose movies from different genres and different eras. Pay attention to details such as:What do you like about a film? What makes a movie believable? What makes a strong character? How are props used successfully? How does the location impact or enhance the film?  , It is important to keep your knowledge current regarding the market. Find out news and trends about the film industry so that you know what you’re up against., Meeting other people in the industry can help you out tremendously. Follow leaders in the filmmaking biz on social media, and attend filmmaking and movie events as often as you can., Speak to someone who has experience with filmmaking. Ask them what tips or tricks they have for you. Ask to tag along when they shoot one of their own movies so you can see firsthand what works and what doesn’t.You may be able to find a mentor in film school. Ask a classmate who has experience or one of your professors to mentor you. Alternatively, once you gain experience on a film crew, you may be able to find a mentor through your work.  In order to gain experience in the industry, you should work on a film crew. Search online for job openings near you, and ask your classmates and professors if they know of any crews seeking help.  The producer can help choose other members for the film crew as well as cast the roles for the movie. This person manages the production from start to finish. They are the group leader and the one who develops the project. You will likely need education as well as experience to qualify for a producer role, but as a beginner you can likely be a production assistant., The director is responsible for overseeing the the shooting and assembly of the film. They work closely with all the other members of the team to ensure everyone is on track., This team writes the script for the film. They must make sure that the content is interesting and follows a logical sequence. They write dialogue for the actors as well as ensure the transitions from one scene to the next make sense., A camera person films the movie. They should have prior experience using a video camera, and be able to film from different angles. Some films require multiple camera people to shoot the film from various angles., The gaffer is in charge of lighting for the movie. They are also the head electrician and are in charge of ensuring there is adequate power on the set and that all cables and cords are properly placed.Crews often also have boom operators to man the microphones, so if you are interested in ensuring the sound for the film is top-notch, become a boom operator.  Actors star in the film, so you should have acting experience for this job. It is important that actors are able to become the person they are portraying, no matter how different the character is from the actor's personality., Technical producers work hard after the filming is completed. They are in charge of choosing which shots to use, editing the film for content, as well as adding special effects and music when necessary., At the very least, you will need a camera. Don’t worry about purchasing one that is top of the line, but instead choose something of good quality at an affordable price. You’ll have plenty of time to upgrade in the future.   If your camera doesn’t have a good microphone, you may also want to purchase boom mics so that the actors’ voices come through loud and clear.  Choose an idea for your first film based on something you are both passionate and knowledgeable about. Get inspiration from the real world, even if your film will be sci-fi or fantasy. The audience should still be able to relate to the issues and connect to the characters.   Focus on content. What’s in your film is more important than the equipment you shoot your film with. Remember to keep your focus on the content of the film and create a story that other people want to see and can identify with., Making a film takes an entire crew to keep things running smoothly. Select people to fill the roles that you cannot, such as producer, director, scriptwriter, camera operator, gaffer, boom operator, costume coordinator, art director, technical producer, and actors.   If you’ve taken film classes, see if any of your classmates are interested in joining your film crew. You can also post notices at school or online to find people willing to become part of the crew.  Pick a nice day when your crew can arrive at the set location. Spend time working with your actors to ensure they deliver their lines correctly and show appropriate emotion.Take your time; your film will be stronger if you aren’t rushing. You may need to film a scene several times to get it right.  Go through each scene to find the best shots. Add music and sound effects to the film. Pay close attention to the details to ensure the film is the best it can be. Make sure transitions are seamless and that there are no errors in your film, such as an actor drinking lemonade for part of one scene and Kool-Aid for another part of the same scene.  This is the most important step because if you do not have fun, it will come across in your film. Laugh at your bloopers, and take breaks if you need them. Remember why you are filming in the first place: you love making movies. Do it for the fun, not the fame.  Distribute your film in every way you can. Post it online, to your social media accounts, YouTube, and Vimeo. You should also try to show your film to people in person. Sign up for screening contests or set up a showing of your film in your hometown.	Take a film class or enroll in film school. Study a related field. Research films. Find out what’s going on in the industry. Network. Find a mentor. Join a film crew. Sign up as an assistant producer to learn how a production works. Assist the director if you want to be at the center of film production. Join the script-writing team if you want to tell a story. Work the camera if you are interested in cinematography. Become a gaffer if you have electrical experience. Try your hand at acting if you want to be on screen. Join the technical production team to affect the appearance of the film. Get the proper equipment. Come up with an idea for a short film. Choose your film crew. Start shooting. Edit your film. Have fun. Market your film.
Using condiments to clean coins might seem ridiculous, but this really works. Get ketchup and squirt it all over a plate. Completely cover the area if you have a lot of pennies, or layer it smoothly if you just have a few.; , Any more than this will result in the job not being properly done. So grab 10 of them and lay them down, spread out flat, on the plate.  Yes, smush. Smush the pennies down into the ketchup, and let them soak in. Jiggle them around a little if necessary.  Use a Q-tip to swab up some ketchup from the side of the plate and spread it on the top of your pennies. Again smush, and continue to spread and smooth.  Use 2 Q-tips to flip each penny over, and spread more over the tops again. Let the pennies soak. Smush, spread, let soak. Smush, spread, let soak.  No, you don't have to reach in the goopy red mess with your bare hands and dig the pennies out. Use a spoon to scoop them out.  By this time, your pennies are going to look even uglier than they did before, with all the ketchup on them. Put them in a bowl and run them under the sink (water temperature doesn't matter). Then pour it out, being careful to hold your hand over the bowl so the money stays inside. Then run water over the pennies once more to ensure cleanliness. ,	Grab some ketchup. Get your pennies in groups of 10. Smush. Spread. Flip. Take them out. Wash them off. Watch your coins sparkle!  , Finished.
Submitting a casting reel can boost your chances at getting on the show. While this is typically done if you can’t attend an open casting call, you also submit a video in addition to attending a casting call if you’re really determined.Your reel shouldn’t be extremely long, but long enough to showcase your “bad girl” attitude.   Introduce yourself and explain why you’d be an excellent cast member. Don’t tell them why you think you’re a bad girl, tell them why you ARE a bad girl. You can film a video just speaking to the camera, or you can enlist a friend or family member to film a more active video, following you around.  Even though Bad Girls Club is reality TV, at the end of the day, it is still a story. Embrace the character you think you’d play on the show. If you’re an aggressive woman dealing with anger issues, highlight that. If you’re a sweetheart with a wild side, show that off. Additionally, highlight the interesting things in your past that have made you a bad girl today. Make sure that your online form, your presence at the casting calls, and your optional filmed reel all create a cohesive image of who you are.   Personal tragedy might not be fun to talk about, but it can make you a fascinating and relatable television personality. Open up about any heartbreak in your life. Reveal anything about yourself that you think no one else can say. Casting directors will get thousands of videos, so make sure yours stands out.  Don’t hurt your chances by second-guessing, doubting, or censoring yourself. Give yourself a pep talk before you begin your auditioning process, and remind yourself that you’re an interesting, strong, entertaining person. If you aren’t confident in who you are, and if you can’t hold your own in a room filled with outspoken women, you’ll probably be overlooked by the Bad Girls Club casting directors.   Fake it ‘til you make it. Even if you feel shy and unsure of yourself, mimic someone you know who is uninhibited, candid, and strong-willed. Soon, these traits can rub off on you and it won’t be “fake” anymore.	Film a reel. Embrace your “character” and back story. Hold nothing back.
Take your sashay yarn and unfurl it so that it looks like a wide flat piece of ribbon. Then, find the loops at the top of the yarn. These will look like small rectangular spaces large enough to easily put your hook through. Count five of these loops and then fold you’re your yarn., With the folded over piece of yarn behind your working yarn, insert your hook through the first loop.For these first few stitches, you will be working through the folded over yarn as well, so you will really be going through two loops.  After getting the first two loops on your hook, skip over the next loop and then insert the hook through the one after that (make sure to get the front and back loop) and chain one.Repeat this four times. To chain with sashay yarn, insert the hook through a loop and then through another. Then, pull the second loop through the first loop on your hook., After you finish four stitches, turn your work and then begin working single crochet stitches into the loops. Do your first single crochet stitch in the first chain stitch in your row.Single crochet every other stitch to the end of your row. To single crochet with sashay yarn, insert the crochet hook into the first stitch and then through a loop on your working yarn. Pull the loop through the first stitch. Then, insert the hook through another loop in your working yarn and pull through both of the other loops on your hook.Continue to turn and single crochet across every row until your scarf is the desired length. You can make a ruffle scarf with just one ball of sashay yarn, but you may make it longer if you prefer.  Once you reach the end of the scarf, cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch (15.25-cm) tail.   Tuck this tail end in between the nearest two ruffles. Use a sewing needle and thread to tack the end in place, securing it and preventing the scarf from unraveling. This completes your ruffle scarf.	Fold over the first five loops of the yarn. Insert your hook through the first loop. Skip a loop and chain one. Turn your work and single crochet into first stitch. Trim the yarn.
The amplifier will need to be turned up fairly loud in order for this to work, so you should protect your ears from potentially harmful sound levels. A good pair of earplugs might be sufficient, but for very loud volumes, specialty sound dampening ear protectors might be best. , Plug in and switch on your amp. You should hear a faint tone caused by the electricity running through it. This means your amp is ready for input. Take the cord end of your mic and plug its audio jack into your amp.   You’ll also need to plug a microphone into your amplifier. You should place your mic as far away from the amplifier as the cable will allow to prevent distortion and mic feedback. Use a microphone stand if you have one available. Singing hands free will allow you to focus more intensely on the task at hand. Remember to wear your ear protection. Also, to minimize your exposure to loud volumes, you should stand behind the amp, or behind it and off to the side. If your mic doesn’t work, check it for an on/off switch. If your mic is already switched on but still is not working, check the audio jack to make sure your it is fully connected to the speaker.  If you are using an unfamiliar amp, test its volume at a medium level before attempting to put it on the maximum setting. Most glasses will require you to reach a minimum of 100 to 110 decibels, which is about the volume of a passing motorbike, a nearby car horn, or the music in a nightclub.You may want to layer the wall your amp is pointed at with sound dampening material, like heavy blankets or cushions. This will prevent the loudness of your amp from aggravating others. Other sound dampening measures you might make use of include acoustic panels, soundproof curtains, and other techniques.  You’ll want to save your voice from unnecessary strain by singing at a soft to moderate volume. Slide your voice in very small increments around the resonant pitch until you feel confident that you have it perfectly. Then increase your volume until you are singing into the microphone directly at a moderate volume.   If your glass refuses to break, check your pitch with a pitch finder. The pitch you are singing might only be off a slight bit, but this can prevent your glass from breaking. Vowels are less obstructed and will help you to achieve louder volumes. In particular, the "ee" vowel sound has the highest volume rating. The vowel “ay” is also rated very highly for volume. Sustain your note as long as possible while making slight adjustments. Even if you hit the resonant frequency dead-on, you’ll have to hold the pitch perfectly for a few seconds before the glass vibrates enough to shatter.Since you are using amplification, you shouldn’t need to shout into the microphone. Speaking loudly puts strain on your voice and can do permanent damage if you’re not careful. Sing into the microphone at a moderate volume and take a break whenever your voice feels tired., A pair of rubber gloves will help prevent you from getting any nicks or cuts from the glass while cleaning. You may want to use a flashlight to help you find difficult to see fragments. Pick up and throw away large pieces of glass with your hands, sweep up smaller fragments, and use care when vacuuming. Glass fragments may cause damage to your vacuum cleaner.A common trick for picking up small shard and slivers of glass uses a slice of soft sandwich bread. Press your bread into the floor wherever you see glass. The glass should get caught into the bread, which you can throw away when the glass is clean or the piece of bread is full of glass. You may need to use several pieces of bread to clean the entire area.	Protect your hearing. Prepare your amplifier. Adjust the volume of your amp. Sing into the microphone. Dispose of the broken glass carefully.
If you do not want the look of an elastic waistband, you can sew a small strip of elastic into the back of your pants. This will help to cinch in your waistband in a less noticeable way. Cut a 1 ½ centimeter (½ inch) wide strip of elastic about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long.The length of elastic will vary depending on the size of your waistband. For example, the elastic should reach about half way between the center belt loop and the side belt loop of your pants.  Turn your pants inside out and center the elastic along the waistband at the back of your pants. To hold the elastic in place, pin it to the pants. Place a pin on either side of the center belt loop, to mark where the belt loop is located.  Begin near the center of the elastic, on one side of the center belt loop, and use a zigzag stitch. Sew through the center of the elastic until you reach the end. In order to sew a zigzag stitch, select the zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. As you sew, pull the elastic tight and let the material of the pants feed through the machine normally.Then repeat the sewing process, starting on the other side of the center belt loop and sew outwards towards the other side of the elastic. Remove the pins as you are sewing. Do not sew over a pin because this could break your needle. Use a thread that matches the color of the pants.	Cut a small strip of elastic. Center the elastic in the back of your pants. Sew the elastic onto the waistband.
The floor is likely to get a little dirty, so thoroughly cover the floor with newspaper. Don't do this on carpet or other floors that should be protected, unless you've lined the floor with plastic.       ; , Place it in the middle of the newspaper-covered area. , This works best if you hold the blade of the screwdriver sideways against the outer portions of the cog and gently turn the cranks. Try to avoid allowing the scraped-off dried mud and dirt to land on the chain.  Dampen it. Provided that you are working in a well-ventilated area, you might like to add a degreasing cleaner, such as lighter fuel or a citrus degreaser. (See "Tips", however.)         , Hold on tightly. Turn the cranks a couple of times while holding the rag around the chain firmly. This works best if you hold the upper portion of the chain, the one that's closest to the saddle (seat). You will notice that the chain becomes much cleaner.           Mark one link with a magic marker, sticker or a piece of tape, so that you know where you started. Starting with the marked link, apply one drop of chain lube to each link. It's best to apply a little drop to each gap where two links overlap. Don't use too much or it will be wasted because you'll wipe off the excess lube anyway!  , When you've lubed all the links, turn the cranks again for half a minute or so to make sure that the lube settles properly into the inside of the link. ,	Lubricate your bicycle in the garage or outdoors. Turn the bike upside down. Familiarize yourself with the parts that touch the chain:          front chain wheels possibly a front derailleur (the part that changes gears in front) rear cogs possibly a rear derailleur with two more cogs.  , Scrape off any mud and dirt from the cogs on the rear derailleur. Prepare the rag. Take the rag in your palm and wrap it around the chain. Lubricate the chain. Allow the lube to settle. Remove any excess lube on the outside of the chain using the rag.         , Clean up.
No matter what bridge you might have, you may be able to set it just about where Ibanez has theirs. Examine an authentic Ibanez and experience the feel and sound of their guitar, paying special attention to where the bridge is set. Then mimic that setting on your own guitar, putting your bridge where it feels most similar to the Ibanez. If you want to, use a guide with a straight edge so it lays almost or is flat across the strings on floating bridges. Make sure not to set the bridge too far away from where it was originally, or you won't be able to play at all.  After raising or lowering the bridge, your strings will be out of tune. Using a tuner, tune your strings until they are fully tuned in E-A-D-G-B-E configuration. Tune them to your preference and make sure they sound right and hit the right notes. Don't worry about buzzing just yet, though.  Buzzing is a major problem when strings are set very low, and most of the buzz comes from the lower strings. To stop this, try using a different gauge of strings. You may think that using thicker strings is counterproductive, but in fact they will be more tensioned when tuned and they will buzz less and will stay in tune longer. Still, thicker strings are not always the best way to fix buzzing. Depending on precisely when and where the buzzing occurs, your diagnosis (and the solution) might be slightly different, so check to make sure all the nuts and frets are in place and secure, then figure out when and where the buzzing occurs before you proceed., Ensure that they are glued down properly. If this doesn't fix the buzzing, you may have to change the nut height. Ibanez guitars straight from the factory are set up either on a slight incline towards the nut or just flat across. If yours are not right, try adjusting them.   To remove the nut, use a sharp blade that is designed specifically for cutting, such as a box cutter or X-acto knife, to cut away the finish. Cut in front, behind, and at the sides, then, gently tap the nut out of its placement. Replace the nut. After the nut is out, replace any wood that came out and then dry fit the new nut. Almost every single nut is imperfect and will require a sanding to make it fit. The best guitar nut to replace the old one is a roller nut, but many are not adjustable, so find one at size or simply add wood underneath to raise the nut. To glue it in place, use wood glue mixed with water, because you may soon need to replace it again.  If you still can't get that Ibanez feel, then try replacing your frets with something different. However, buying an Ibanez is cheaper than having someone redo your frets, and unless you know what you're doing, trying to do them on your own could destroy your neck. If you think this is necessary in order to make your guitar feel like an Ibanez, it may not be worth the expense and risk, so think carefully before taking this step.  After getting everything to feel just right to you, tune or restring your guitar and play, making small adjustments as necessary. Many adjustments will probably be needed to the way you play, so play and correct your action until the result is satisfactory to you.	Set your action. Tune your strings. Set the strings to prevent buzzing. Check the guitar nut. Check out your frets. Tune and restring the guitar.
Moss roses are well-known for their combination of beauty and durability. They suit most climates well, and amply reward their caretakers with amazing blooms. However, they do have a few quirks, so double-check to make sure your garden can support them.   Moss roses are succulents, storing water in large, fleshy leaves. This means that they will be fine if you forget to water them.They can grow in poor soil or even rock gardens.However, they might drown in a very rainy climate. Moss roses are low-lying, rarely topping six inches in height. They are good for borders and pots, but do not command large-scale attention on their own.Moss roses can absorb the carbon dioxide from car exhaust especially efficiently. This means that they are sometimes used to line driveways, or parking lots.Though some varieties of their seeds are edible to humans, moss roses are toxic to pets. Do not plant them where a dog or cat can snack on them.; , Now that you know you’re ready for moss roses, it’s time to figure out where to put them. Since moss roses love sun, make sure they will get full sunlight for at least part of the day. If you are planning to use them in a flower display, plan to put them in front, as portulaca plants are low-lying.   To know how many moss rose plants you need for a border, measure the length in yards or meters, then divide by three--that’s the number of roses you need to fill the border with plenty of space between the young plants. Don’t worry; moss roses grow fast, so you won’t have gaps for long.You don’t have to plant moss roses outside. They are pretty in pots, too, as long as they get plenty of sunlight., If you are a more confident gardener, you may already be planning to work with seeds. If you would prefer to begin your garden with a little bit of a head start, seedlings may work for you. There are pros and cons to each, so think about it and decide which suits you better.Seeds are cheaper, and you can start growing them (indoors or outdoors) whenever you’re ready. However, it can be difficult to wait two weeks for them to germinate, and then an additional month until they're sturdy enough to move. Seedlings are convenient and already healthy, but because a greenhouse has done the work of germination for you, they are often expensive.  You can buy moss rose seedlings at any local greenhouse, since they are popular summer plants, though they may be tricky to find in grocery stores. Seeds can also be found in greenhouses or garden supply stores, or well-reviewed online shops.  If you're using seeds and experiencing a long winter, you should start growing inside. This will keep the seedlings warm and protected until you’re ready to plant them outdoors. Your specific seed variety will probably have instructions, but in general, moss roses grow in similar ways.   Place seeds uncovered on shallow dry soil (a few inches deep is fine) and keep at room temperature.You can sprinkle them with a little water every few days, but they don’t need much. The seeds should germinate within two weeks, but wait an additional month before you move them., Moss roses are used to balmy summer climates. As hardy as they are with little water, a cold snap can easily kill them.Keep seedlings inside until you’re certain the ground won’t freeze. Treat them as you would if they were outside--make sure they get full sun and a sprinkle of water every now and then.  Once the frost is gone for good, it’s time to plant your seeds or seedlings outside. Make sure to space them out (12 inches, or .3 meters, is great) and cover them with minimal soil. They should be thriving in no time.   If you live in a warm area, you can plant seeds directly--just scatter them on the ground and cover with a little seeding soil.If you’re transplanting home-grown or commercial seedlings into the warmed ground, dig a small hole the size of the container the seedlings are in, then lift up the plant by its base and place it into the hole., Plan to baby your moss roses for their first few days outside. For about a week, water them on a daily basis, since the roots have not yet expanded to fill the full area needed to get water to the whole plant.After this first week, you can water them less frequently.  You should try to mimic desert rain habits by watering the plants thoroughly, and letting them dry out before watering them again. Watering them about once a week will usually work well. Make sure they don’t experience too much runoff from other plants that need more water.  Not only would it be a tragedy to lose the flowers, but they could poison the animals you know. You probably already planted the seeds where they couldn’t be reached by your own pets--make sure to prevent other pets in the neighborhood from running amok through your garden, too., This is one of the few tasks you will have to do for your portulaca on a frequent basis once your plant is settled. Manually removing blossoms that have gone to seed ensures that your plants replace dead flowers. To deadhead, take a firm hold on a dried-up bloom, and them pull steadily. It will come off, revealing the bud of a new flower beneath it.Save a few of the heads if you want to reuse the seeds next year.  Moss roses are nearly as versatile as many weeds, but they can still be choked out if you don’t remove invasive plants. Weed weekly at the very least, for the amount of water your garden gets, and its fertility, are both factors in how many weeds your garden will attract.  Most moss rose varieties are annuals, which means that they don’t live past the autumn. You can replant them next year, even using the seeds you collected when deadheading them. Just crush the old flowers to reveal the seeds, then place them in an envelope and keep it in a cool, dry place until next year.	Find out if moss roses are right for you. Plan out your planting. Decide if you want seeds or seedlings. Get your flowers. Grow seeds indoors. Wait until after the last frost to plant outside. Plant outside. Make sure that the roots are set. Water your moss roses. Keep away from pets. Deadhead your plants. Weed your plants. Repeat the process next year.
Play with as many musicians as you can. Meeting other artists can lead to future opportunities. Collaborate with other established acts whenever possible.  A CD showcasing your abilities is a simple method of letting potential employers or band mates know what you can do.   Record a few solid tracks that highlight your drumming skills. It should be strong representation of your ability, and it should include some versatility in musical genres.  Carefully listen to all of the tracks you can find from the artist for whom you are auditioning. Practice the songs you are going to be playing by continuously running through them before the gig.  Knowing how to sight read a drum chart will impress during an audition, and it often can make a studio session run much more smoothly.  Tune your drums before a gig or audition. Replace old, worn out drumheads.  If an audition or performance goes badly, try to pinpoint what went wrong and straighten it out for the next time. Use your shortcomings to motivate you to improve your craft.  Playing live is vastly different than playing in the studio, and musicians are often judged by whether their live performance is up to par.	Network with other musicians. Record a demo. Prepare for auditions or studio sessions like a professional. Learn to read drum charts. Maintain your gear. Learn from your mistakes. Learn about stage presence and live performance skills.
They usually will if you call ahead for permission. Or obtain large pieces of cardboard elsewhere, for example, an appliance store.   The cardboard will stay flat better if you use a string trimmer to clear the area first. Trim as close to the ground as possible, being sure not to damage bark of shrubs or trees with the trimmer. You could also mow the area closely. If the ground is dry, water it. Put down cardboard, overlapping edges by at least 6". Weigh down the cardboard with bricks, large rocks, or best of all, a heavy (4") layer of mulch such as wood chips. This is most effective when the ground is damp and the growing season is active. Late winter is ideal in many climates. You can accomplish the same thing by putting down heavy layers of newspaper and covering with mulch. You may wish to pre-moisten the newspaper by dipping it in a bucket or wheelbarrow full of water. If you're using cardboard, remove tape, staples, labels, and anything else that won't break down eventually.; , By spring, all the weeds will have been smothered and it will be easier to start a garden there. Move the carpet to the next area and repeat. Cover the carpet with wood chips for improved aesthetics. In late spring, rake off the chips, remove the carpet, and rake the chips back onto the weed free area to keep new weeds from growing.   Carpet is not biodegradable, so plan to remove it before you plant.  In Idaho it costs five dollars. Rock makes a great mulch and will extend the growing season by retaining heat into the night. This is less environmentally friendly than wood chips, and small rocks may well work themselves into the soil and make it harder to dig weeds out.  Some electric companies remove plants that grow near wires and shred them. The electric company will deliver a load (dump truck) of not cleaned wood chips. Look in the yellow pages. Wood chips make perhaps the best mulch, except on vegetable gardens. Coarse wood chips allow weed seeds to fall down through them, then never get enough light to germinate. When the chips rot, they will improve the soil and you can add more. Use a generous layer—at least 4".   Place wood chips on top of cardboard or newspaper to exclude weeds for longer (at least until the mulches break down). The wood chips will soften the look of the material underneath.  (These also make a great wrap to protect shrubs through the winter.) Coffee shops may also be able to offer spent coffee grounds and filters, which can be composted or applied to soil directly.  They often are available for free to local residents at a service center or some other location. You will need to contact the appropriate office in your area to check. Be sure to bring your own rake or shovel and containers or pickup truck.  If you have a large tree that drops leaves, or your neighbors do, take a bin and collect them. You can use a lawn mower to help shred them, let the kids play in piles, or just use them whole. Whole leaves will take a lot longer to break down, but they will smother weeds better in the meantime.	Ask your local landfill if you can take some flattened cardboard home for your garden. Place a square of used carpet on the planned garden area and leave it over the winter. Get a permit from your local Forest Service to collect rocks. Many tree services and electric companies will deliver a free load of wood chips. Ask your local coffee shop if they throw out empty burlap coffee bean bags. Many cities or municipalities will collect branches and leaves in the fall, which are ground or chipped into a mulch. Collect your own leaves.
The kanji for "Kurenai" can also be read as "beni" which is a word used for red makeup used traditionally in Japan to color the lips red. The red she wears is somewhat dark, so look for darker shades. For the eye makeup, you should can wear lavender eyeshadow and apply black/dark mascara with thin, dark eyeliner. For the face, try to apply a thin layer of usually light colored foundation, and use cover-up for blemishes/scars.; , (Or, if on a really small budget, just wear a regular headband, preferably a dark blue.) Be sure to wear it covering most (but not all) of your forehead. That's just the style. The "bangs" should go over the headband.  Bangs should be grown out, and parted in the middle. They should also stick up over the headband, and then fall flat. (See photos of Kurenai for reference)  , If you really want to act like her, you also have to keep up with your personal hygiene.  Wigs should be styled slightly wavy in certain spots, with curls at the ends of strands.  Athletic tape can work well. Or just you can just wear a really long or tight wrist band if you want to give it that Kurenai touch.	As for the lips, wear red lipstick. Wear the Konoha {Leaf} village headband, which can easily be found online, in the mall, or in anime speciality stores for usually a low price. Wear your hair long, but not too long. Keep your face nice and clear. Have a medium black hair or get a nicely styled wig. Wear white (but not clear) tape on your wrists/almost halfway up your arms.
If you’re looking to create a uniform row of plants, try growing your plants from cuttings. This essentially means you are growing clones of a parent plant.   Growing from seed or bulb may mean your plants have more variety, which may not be the look you want to achieve.; , Remove any remnants of the previous year’s crop and any fallen branches, weeds, and stones. Till the ground to break up the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches (15.2 cm). Try to improve the soil by adding well-rotted manure. Add this manure well before you plan to plant your field.   For example, sweet peas will grow better if manure is dug into the beds at least a month ahead of planting time.  If you need to alter the soil pH, you should also plan to do this well before you plan to plant your field.   For example, if you are growing lavender (which favors an alkaline soil) you might try to add lime to acid soils to raise the pH.  A ‘green manure’ crop is a fast-growing crop that protects the soil’s nutrients and the soil structure while the field is bare. The green manure is then tilled back into the soil so the nutrients are returned and the soil is ready for the next crop (your flowers).   Green manures include alfalfa, buckwheat and clover.  This depends on which variety you are growing and what size the plants achieve, as well as how much space you need between rows in order to tend them. Start planning your rows by hammering a stake into the ground at both ends of the first row. Tie a piece of string between the stakes and use this to guide your planting.   Lavender plants need at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) between them, plus room for you to walk between the rows to prune and harvest (you should create rows that are at least the width of your shoulders).  Dig holes for your plants that are as deep as the plant container and twice as wide. Add a handful of slow release fertilizer, such as bonemeal, to the hole and mix the fertilizer in.   Don’t let the young plant’s roots touch the fertilizer directly.  You may find it helpful to carry a backpack watering device to help cover the large area of the field. You can then lay down weed proof matting, but this is not essential.   Water the young plants until they are established. Plants will usually become established within a few weeks.  You may want to lay an irrigation system to efficiently water your plants using minimal water. This is especially recommended for lavender, as watering directly to the base of the plant via an irrigation pipe laid on the ground helps avoid ‘splitting’, a problem that can occur from overhead watering.  Established plants such as lavender shouldn’t need watering unless it is exceptionally hot, dry or windy.   Check the pruning advice for your particular variety. Make sure you go out into your field regularly to inspect for problems such as bug attacks or disease.	Grow from cuttings it you want your field to have a uniform look. Prepare your soil. Alter the pH of the soil if necessary. Try planting a ‘green manure’ crop the previous year. Decide how wide the rows need to be. Dig your holes. Plant the young plants and water well. Create an irrigation system. Continue to care for your field of flowers.
,,,, Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its to the left of the correct one). Then loosen the pump from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet/hammer, but if it does not come loose pretty easily -- check again for another bolt.  If your water pump used a metal gasket and it is still secure to the engine and in good shape, do not remove it. Just clean it up and mount your new water pump to it. The metal gasket is better than any new fiber gasket that might have come with your new pump.  To tighten 12mm bolts securely without over-tightening, breaking one off: Start the bolts by hand; first just barely snug them, then gradually tighten them evenly, in two for three passes, in a star pattern, back and forth across, from side-to-side to minimize any possible warping. Seal the new gasket only onto the new pump with "gasket cement." Do not cement it onto the block. Put anti-seize grease on bolts. You can put an even coating of marine grease on the gasket after it is cemented onto the pump so it will not stick to the engine block.   Or if you prefer to use a silicone gasket maker, then apply a small even bead but not an excessive amount that could squeeze out and cause plugging/blockage of coolant passage-ways in the engine or radiator.  Hook the new spring in the hole of the tensioner ear/tab and use the Allen wrench in the hole that is in the front surface of the tensioner pulley for that wrench to bring the spring clockwise to get the spring near and then hooked onto the pin that protrudes from the engine block just above the pulley. Be sure the spring is hooked into the groove on the engine pin. , (Like a 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) open end wrench on special hex-part of cam along the middle length of the cam can be used to budge the cam just slightly to get a cam timing mark back aligned while keeping the the stopper "jammed" in (to hold the sprockets/cams) in place until you get the belt on and the tension spring on correctly. So, starting at the crankshaft sprocket place the belt a little more than halfway onto the sprocket and then going counter-clockwise making sure the belt is tightly against the idler pulley/roller as you slip the belt onto the cam sprockets and tight across between the cam sprockets when on both of them.  While holding that hex wrench, begin to work the belt in steps farther onto each sprocket until it is on all the way. ,   Hand rotate the crankshaft two times around, using a wrench on the crankshaft sprocket bolt, then check to see that when the crankshaft key is aligned, then the two cam timing marks are still aligned as described earlier. Be sure one or both isn't off by one notch or something. If it is not aligned properly then remove the belt, carefully realign all 3 marks and reinstall the belt, and double-check it again.	Readying to remove the timing belt, you need to turn the timing belt-tensioner pulley toward "counter-clockwise" with an Allen "el-shaped" hex tool that fits in a hole in the pulley to rotate it to be able to slip the belt off little by little.  , Turn (pivot) the timing belt tensioner pulley toward "clockwise" with the Allen hex wrench enough to take the tension off of the timing belt tensioner spring, and then remove the spring with very long-nose-pliers.  , Remove the tensioner pulley by one bolt in the middle (14mm).  , Remove the "idler" pulley of the timing belt system by one bolt in the middle (14mm).  , Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- (12mm) socket -- and a medium size ratchet (called 3/8 inch drive in the USA). Clean the engine block surface carefully where the water pump gasket will make contact for sealing well -- so carefully scrape off any pieces of stuck-on old gasket material corrosion, rust, or dirt to bare metal but not gouging or roughing the metal. Put on the "new water pump"; follow instructions that came with it. Install the "new timing tensioner" pulley and tighten its mounting bolt securely. Install the new "idler pulley" and tighten the mounting bolt securely.  , Put on the "new timing belt"; follow instructions that came with it. Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way enough, using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide onto the sprockets. With the Allen wrench in the hole in the tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.  , Remove the "stopper block" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.
Different string gauge and material give you different feel and sound. Research what you need by all means necessary, including playing your guitar. Some examples are; Rock genres- 46-36-26-15-13-10. Metal/down-tune- 54-48-42-24-17-12  , After finding a gauge you like string them onto your guitar and always stretch them. Remember that most guitars will not hold past certain brands of 56 gauge.  Sometimes a perfect lower gauge action will not be welcomed with a higher gauge string. Adjust your bridge referencing to step 1 to accumulate the best of your guitar.	Know what you need. Find a gauge. Adjust accordingly.
