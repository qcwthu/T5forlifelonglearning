Using temporary coverings like newspaper, towels, old sheets, or painter's groundsheets, cover anything of value as this will prevent possible spills of water or cleaning solution from ruining the carpet or furniture.; , Move these pieces of furniture because dust can build up behind dressers, appliances, and other types of furniture. Once it’s out of your way, you can clean the areas that often go neglected.  Use either a broom, a dusting brush, or a vacuum cleaner to do this. Run the broom, brush, or vacuum up and down the walls in a vertical motion.If the broom or brush has strong bristles, tie an old t-shirt or other cleaning rag over it to prevent the sharpness of the bristles from scratching against the wall.  Then, move up gradually, drying as you go. This will help you to avoid the creation of streaks or drip marks.	Cover any carpet or furniture in the immediate area. Move everything that is against the wall. Dust the walls. Start at the top of the wall when washing.
Combine the two ingredients in equal amounts. Mix them and they will form a paste. This paste may also help remove dark spots, including pet stains, without scrubbing.Other options are to sprinkle on the baking soda and mop the next day or combine equal amounts of baking soda and water into a paste., Place the paste on the stain using a non-abrasive sponge, brush, or cloth. Allow the paste to sit until it dries. Afterwards, wipe it up and see if the stain is gone.  Place some of your castile soap or plant-based dish detergent on a microfiber cloth. Use it to break down the grease., Dampen a clean microfiber cloth. Wring it out first so it is not dripping. Remove all of the soap. If the spot is not gone, you can try repeating the steps, cleaning with more detergent. When you’re finished, you can sand down the grain to make it look as good as new.	Mix baking soda and white vinegar. Apply the paste to the stain. Rub oil-based stains with dish detergent. Rinse the spot with water.
On the back of the computer, use a screwdriver to remove the two screws that hold the access panel in place, then slide and lift it away from you.  Press in on the two plastic tabs which are next to the underlying green arrows, then rotate it away from you and lift it out., Most Compaq Evo towers have one or two CD drives and a floppy drive. Disconnect the power, data and CD drive cables (if any) from all drives. After disconnecting the cables, while holding the green button, pull each drive from the computer. Replace the drives by following this step in reverse order, but insert them horizontally and with the floppy drive at the top., On the back of the front panel, rotate the silver Compaq Evo logo upside down by pressing out on the two plastic clips. After rotating the logo upside down, with the back of the front panel facing you, remove the drive bezel by lifting it out, then rotate the drive bezel counterclockwise.,	Remove the access panel. Remove the front panel. Rotate the CD and floppy drives to the horizontal orientation. Rotate the drive bezel so that it corresponds to the desktop orientation.Repeat steps 1 and 2 in reverse order to reassemble your computer.
Which form do you prefer? Makashi? Soresu? Djem So? Something else? Particular forms work better with different lightsaber styles.; , A short person would have real trouble wielding a lightclub. A strong person probably doesn't want to use a curved-hilt lightsaber. Certain lightsabers require certain physical traits to wield effectively.  Pacifist Jedi were disapproving of weapons such as the saberstaff, calling them "more slaughter per swing". Sith, on the other hand, loved weapons like this. More aggressive people probably want lightsabers that do greater damage, and more pacifist people should choose sabers better suited to defense (funnily enough, a saberstaff fits both these requirements).  Quarterstaff or bo staff training lends itself well to saberstaff wielding. Whip users can become lightwhip users. Ever practised with one of those batons that policemen (or stormtrooper TR-8R) use - the one with a handle sticking out of the side? Look no further than the guard shoto.	Look at your combat style. Consider your physique. Look at your philosophy. Consider your training with other weapons.
Combine 1 part ammonia and 1 part water in a spray bottle, then close the spray bottle and shake. Spray the ammonia spray around entry points in your house and other places where spiders tend to gather. Reapply the spray every week.Instead of making a spray, you can also dip a cloth in the solution and use it to wipe around the entry points of your house for a more concentrated application.  Combine one part vinegar to two parts water in a spray bottle and shake to mix. Spray the vinegar spray around doorways, window frames, or other points of entry in your house, reapplying the spray every week for the best results., Pour half an ounce (14.78 ml) of salt into a half gallon (1.89 liters) of warm water and mix until the salt is dissolved. Then pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Use the spray on points of entry to deter spiders, reapplying the spray once a week.Spraying salt water directly on a spider can kill it.  Fill a spray bottle almost to the top with hot water, then add a healthy pinch of tobacco. Allow the tobacco to soak into and infuse the water for about an hour, then spray the mixture around the entry points of your home. The strong smell of the tobacco will drive away unwanted spiders.	Make an ammonia repellent. Make a vinegar spray. Make a saltwater spray. Create a tobacco spray.
It is much easier to hit a fly that is not moving. Be stealthy! The fly is probably scoping you out as much as you're scoping it out.   If it's in a position you don't like, wreak havoc around it. It'll be forced to go into a different, hopefully, more open area. If you know it's somewhere but don't know where, turn off the TV and anything else that's making noise. This will enable you to hear the fly and track it more easily once it takes to the air.; , Get close enough to be able to swing and hit the fly, but not so close that it startles the fly into flying around again.   This takes some skill. You are up against an evasion artist. Before the fly takes off, it is executing a complex pre-flight routine: precise leg-to-eye positioning is taking place moment-by-moment. The extraordinary eyes (viewing field nearly 360°) pinpoint your location and the fly's nervous system translates this perception into precise leg positioning. These optimize instant take-off in the most likely evasive direction.And this is why it often seems that the fly is blessed with precognitive powers.  You'll need to be able to swing fast and accurately. If flies are a constant problem, start practicing your aim and stealth (and clean up and shut your windows and doors).   The fly is planning to fly away at the last second. What you have to do is to predict where it is going to fly and aim there. You're going to beat him at his own game. Try to get him into a corner to limit his possibly flyaway zone.  Be sure to clean up the remains of the fly after swatting it. Or you could leave it, completely creep out your family, and leave a stain on the wall.   You may want to use Windex, Pledge, or some sort of cleaner. This goes double if your victim was one of those huge, bulbous, super-buzzy flies.	Wait until the fly is stationary. Sneak up behind the fly. Swing at the fly. Clean up the mess.

In case the inspection by the officer concerned does not happen within 30 days, speak to the assistant commissioner or Taluk supply officer concerned. Thereafter, if the application is found acceptable by the assistant commissioner or Taluk supply officer as per the above eligibility conditions, then the application is approved and sent for the family card to be printed.  After approval by assistant commissioner, applicants are requested not to get in touch with the AC or TSO offices (unless filing additional documents) earlier than 30 days, to avoid unnecessary workload on the offices of this department. This will enable the department to serve you better.   As soon as the application is filed, the applicant must collect the acknowledgement slip with the office seal, date of application, serial number and date of final disposal. The Government of Tamil Nadu has fixed the time limit for passing orders on applications for new ration as 60 days from the date of application. Once the application is found eligible for issue of a new family card, the card is sent for printing. As soon as the printed card arrives in the office, the Assistant Commissioner or Taluk Supply Officer has to send a post card to the applicant requesting him/her to collect the ration card in person with the acknowledgement slip within 15 days. In case the application is rejected, the assistant commissioner or Taluk supply officer has to send a post card to the applicant indicating the reasons for rejection within 60 days of the application date.

Put a small amount of an alcohol-based cleaner such as cheap hairspray or rubbing alcohol on an inconspicuous spot on the wood. Wipe the area clean and let it dry.  Use enough hairspray or other alcohol-based cleaner to fully cover the stain.If you’re using hairspray, cheap hairspray is best, as it contains a higher percentage of alcohol than more expensive hairsprays. Use cotton swabs to apply the hairspray or other household item, especially if the ink stain is a thin line.  Choose a cloth that you don’t mind getting stained, since the ink will transfer to this cloth. Blot gently by pressing the cloth into the stained area. Do not rub it around or scrub, as this can spread the stain.   Keep turning the cloth over to a fresh surface so that you are not transferring ink back onto the carpet., Use lukewarm water to rinse the carpet thoroughly. Dip an old clean cloth into a bowl of water and wring out some of the excess water. Dab this cloth on the cleaned stain area to help rinse the carpet.   You may need to do this rinsing process several times to fully remove the hairspray.  Leave the carpet overnight to give it time to dry. Turn up the heat in the room to help speed up the drying process. Vacuum the rug to remove any excess cleaning debris.	Pretest the cleaning product. Cover the stain with an alcohol-based household product. Blot with a white towel or cloth. Rinse with water and allow to dry. Let the carpet dry and vacuum.
Fetch a roll of duct tape, electrical tape, or any other type that is totally opaque. Open your shoebox. Hold it up to a light source to see if any cracks, joins, or holes are permitting light to enter the box from the outside. If so, cover those areas with tape to keep all unnecessary light out. Do the same with the cover to the shoebox.  Use a pencil or pen to trace a 1”x1” (2.54 cm x 2.54 cm) hole on one of the box’s smaller ends. Place it near the edge of the box’s bottom, but leave about a half-inch of space between the hole and the edge so you don’t accidentally tear the edge when you make your cut. Use a utility blade to cut the hole along your outline.For safety’s sake, always have the sharp end of the blade facing away from you in case it slips.  Cut out a piece of tin or aluminum foil that is slightly larger than your hole. Cover the hole from the inside and tape the foil’s edges to the inside of the box. Use a pin, needle, or thumbtack to prick a very tiny hole in the foil. Aim for the center.Make sure the foil is pulled taut when you tape it. Otherwise, you may end up only pushing the foil with your pin or needle instead of poking a hole through it.  Place it inside the box, directly across from the foil, in the exact same position along the box’s other smaller end. Tape it in place along its edges. Close the box with its cover once you finish.When the foil end is aimed at the eclipse, the sunlight should penetrate the foil through the hole you poked and then strike the piece of paper that you just taped up at the opposite end, just like a film projector aimed at a theater screen.  Trace another 1”x1” (2.54 cm x 2.54 cm) outline to cut along one of the box’s longer sides. Use your utility blade to cut the hole out. Peer inside and make sure you have a clear view of the white screen.If you placed both the foil and the white screen near the bottom of the box, you can judge the best angle for viewing the screen from the top before closing the box. If the lid to your box is totally detachable, you can also use other lids to cut new viewing holes if your first attempt does not provide a good view of the screen.  Seal the lid with opaque tape to keep any more light from creeping into the box. Just before the eclipse begins, aim the foil end of the box at the sun. Check its shadow to make sure the box is lined up perfectly with the sun. As the eclipse begins, peer into the box through the viewing hole. Look for a circle of light projected onto the white screen. Track the moon’s shadow over this circle of light as the moon passes between Earth and the sun.	Block all light from entering the shoebox. Create a square hole to aim at the eclipse. Cover the hole. Add a “screen.” Cut out a piece of plain white paper that is roughly the same size as your foil. Cut a square viewing hole. Use your box.
If your extended family is too large for you to see everyone on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, use Boxing Day to include them in your holidays. Have a formal holiday feast or keep true to the more relaxed spirit of Boxing Day and have a simpler get-together.Popular food served as a Boxing Day meal includes leftover Christmas turkey served as sandwiches or another full meal, or alternately a cold ham or roast beef served as a buffet to minimize prep and cooking.In the UK and Canada, many restaurants welcome large parties for Boxing Day carveries, or buffets serving roast meats carved to order.  If you’ve already checked family off your list of holiday duties, feel free to make Boxing Day a time to spend with friends instead. Go to a sporting event or watch one at the local pub. Or just hang out together at someone’s home., Put the formality of the holidays behind you. Host a potluck where everyone’s free to get rid of their leftovers. Make it a pajama party if you want to make it even less formal and more inviting. Tune into the football marathon on TV, zone out, and be merry., Since sports and exercise are such a large part of Boxing Day, stay in the spirit and have the whole family get some exercise. Use this extra time together to go for a long hike through the woods or walk through the streets., Take the young kids to see this family-friendly piece of lively theater based on fairy tales, which is traditionally performed on Boxing Day. Sing along with the musical numbers and interact with the performers onstage.	Visit family. Spend time with friends. Keep it casual. Go on an outing. Attend a pantomime.
Larger hearts require thicker, longer strips of paper, whereas smaller, delicate hearts will come from thinner, shorter strips.   Avoid using construction paper for this project, as it is too heavy and won’t curl properly.  No template is needed for this project––each heart is created from a strip of the quilling paper. Just make sure that you have an even measurement/edge on each strip. Note that a symmetrical heart has an equal width on each strip.  Each heart should be created the same way, using your pencil and clean fingers.   Fold the paper strip in half. Make sure that the ends meet up evenly and you have a firm crease in the middle of the paper strip. Place your pencil or pen side along the top of one of the paper strips. Hold the paper strip firmly next to the pencil. Wind the pencil and paper downward toward the center crease of the paper. Wind halfway down the middle of the folded paper strip and then slowly remove the pencil. Repeat the curling step on the other paper strip. Curl inward and stop halfway down.  These can be glued onto cards, posters, etc., or glued together in a chain for a garland or wreath, etc.	Determine the sizes of the paper hearts before cutting the paper. Cut the paper strips. Create the heart. Finished.
What's the worst part of this? The demolition. Cost: $1,000 or more.  DIY is great for many things, but it is virtually impossible to do a decent bathtub refinishing job by yourself. Porcelain, fiberglass, and cast-iron tubs can all be refinished.  But they are always cheaper than full replacement, and unlike refinishing, you never worry about the finish wearing away.  Nearly impossible to achieve a smooth finish, and DIY finishes will begin to peel and chip soon after.	Replacement: Tear out your existing tub/shower and replace. Refinishing: Refinishing is a hire-the-pro project. Tub Liners: At prices equal to or greater than refinishing, bathtub liners are not the bargain option. DIY Refinishing: Worth mentioning as something you probably do not want to take on.
While this folding technique will do wonders for preventing wrinkles during the traveling process, it can't do anything for wrinkles or stains that are already there. To ensure your suit jacket is in tip-top shape, send it to the dry cleaner's at least a week before you leave and ensure the cleaner presses the suit in addition to removing any stains.   If you're pressed for time, you may want to iron the suit yourself. If you do so, ensure the lapels are well-ironed - it's possible to hide wrinkles elsewhere on the suit, but nearly impossible to hide them on the lapels.; , Turn the fabric of your jacket around so that the lining is on the outside. This protects the actual outer fabric of the jacket - now, if the jacket incurs any wrinkles while traveling, they're likely to be on the inside of the jacket when you wear it.  Next, put your hand inside the coat and push your fist into the shoulders so that the lining of the shoulders "pops" out. These inside-out shoulders make the jacket much easier to fold - if you hadn't popped them out, you would have to deal with the awkwardness of inward-facing shoulder pads.  Gather both shoulders in one hand and use the other to grasp the jacket at the midpoint of its collar. This should have the effect of folding the jacket in half lengthwise. Straighten the material of the jacket out after folding - the liner should still be on the outside.  Place your forearm horizontally across the middle of the jacket and fold the top of the jacket over. This should create a roughly square "bundle" that fits easily in a suitcase.  To protect your jacket in your luggage, it's a wise idea to place it in a plastic bag separate from other clothing. Slide the square, folded "bundle" that your jacket is in into a large plastic bag (like a dry cleaning bag or a large ziplock bad). Seal the bag carefully. If you don't have a bag handy, use a sheet of sturdy plastic material. Place the folded jacket in the middle of the sheet and fold the sides in and under the jacket.          If you're using a plastic bag, try to trap a little air in the bag with the suit. This protective "bubble" can prevent the other clothes in the suitcase from pressing into the jacket, eliminating wrinkles.  Try keep the suit as flat as possible and to avoid compressing it. To minimize wrinkling, place only other flat, folded items of clothing on top of the jacket. Avoid placing hard, awkwardly-shaped items like shoes on top of the jacket.  When you arrive at your destination, you'll want to essentially do the steps above in reverse. Remove any clothes on top of the jacket, open its bag, undo the horizontal and vertical folds in it, and turn the fabric right-side out. Wrinkling should be minimal - to combat any wrinkles that remain, hang the suit immediately.   For persistent wrinkles, try hanging the jacket in the bathroom. When you take a shower, the warmth and steam will loosen the fabric, helping to release any difficult wrinkles.  The simplest option when it comes to folding pants for traveling is to make only vertical, lengthwise folds. This strategy is best for pants with "pleats" - vertical folds sewn into the fabric along the waist of the pants. If your pants have pleats, fold vertically along these. This way, even if the fold sets into the pants as a wrinkle, the long, continuous vertical wrinkles will look like the result of ironing.   You may also fold the pants in half vertically to further save space.  One of the big disadvantages of folding pants only vertically is that many suitcases simply aren't big enough to stretch the entire pant leg out in. If you're pressed for space, try rolling your pants. Fold the pants in half vertically and lay them on a clean, flat surface. Starting at the bottom, roll the pant legs into a tight bundle. This prevents wrinkles by exposing a minimum of the pants' surface area to other items in the suitcase and makes the pants take up relatively little space.  If you can, you'll want to avoid folding dress pants horizontally, as this can contribute to creases that can't be explained away as the result of ironing. However, if you do fold your pants horizontally (this is usually done after folding the pants once vertically), you can minimize by wrinkles by following the same rules as listed above for suit jackets - place only flat, folded items on top of them, place them in a bag if possible, and so on.   One great idea for pants folded horizontally is to "sandwich" them within the two sides of the folded suit jacket. This provides them the protection of the inside-out jacket fabric as well as the jacket's bag.  You don't necessarily have to button every button - just enough to keep the front of the shirt closed. Next, lay the shirt face down with its material spread flat and its sleeves stretched out.   If you happen to have extra dry cleaning bags, you may want to lay one squarely in the middle of the back of the shirt. This prevents the shirt from pressing against itself while folded, reducing the chance of wrinkles.  Make two vertical folds along the back of the shirt to bring the edges of the shirt roughly one sleeve-length inward. Straighten the edges of the shirt so that they are uniform and parallel.  Next, take each sleeve and fold it down so that it lines up with the folded edges of the shirt. The edges of the sleeve should be roughly in line with both the new outer edge of the shirt and with the edge of the shirt material that has been folded inward. Make minor adjustments, straightening the fabric as necessary until it lines up perfectly.   At this point, a good rule of thumb is that the shirt's shoulders should now be shortened so that only an inch or two of material is left on either side of the collar.  Like with dress pants, long, continuous vertical creases look better on dress shirts than horizontal folds do. The former resemble the types of creases that can result from ironing, while the latter generally look like nothing other than what they are. Because of this, if you have room in your suitcase, you may want to place the shirt in now, rather than after the next fold.   If you have a bag that's big enough to hold the shirt in its current partly-folded state, use it. If not, you can try bunching up the bottom of the shirt in the bag - since this part of your shirt will be covered by your jacket, it's not as important for it to be 100% wrinkle-free.  If you don't have enough space to put your shirt in your suitcase halfway-folded or simply aren't worried about wrinkles, continue folding. Grab the bottom edge of the shirt (including the sleeves) and bring it up to the shoulders. Flip the shirt over - it should be a nice, tidy square with the collar and buttons centered in the middle.   If you laid a dry cleaning bag in the middle of your shirt at the beginning of this method, it will protect your shirt from pressing against itself at this point. You can also get a similar effect by slipping a flat cardboard insert between the two halves of the folded shirt.  Place the folded shirt in a dry cleaning bag or a large ziplock bag and seal the bag. As noted above, you may want to trap a small amount of air in the bag along with the shirt to create a protective bubble that can help prevent the other items in the suitcase from pressing on the shirt.  Ensure the shirt sits face-up in the suitcase and that nothing heavy or hard is packed on top of it. Ideally, the shirt should be surrounded with flat, folded fabric clothing.   Upon arrival, unpack your suitcase and inspect your shirt for wrinkles. Hang the shirt immediately or iron.	Clean and press your suit before you travel. Turn the jacket inside out. Pop the shoulders inside out. Fold the jacket vertically. Fold the jacket in half horizontally. Place the jacket in a plastic bag. Lay the wrapped jacket in your suitcase. Unfold your jacket at your destination. Fold the pants along their pleats. Roll the pants to save space. Fold horizontally with caution. To begin, button the shirt and lay it face-down on a flat surface. Fold the edges of the shirt inward. Fold the sleeves down along the new edges. Consider packing the shirt as-is. Fold the shirt horizontally in half. Place the shirt in a bag. Lay the shirt in your suitcase.
When stalking your friend, be sure to dress for the weather. You don't want to stand out with a trench coat and an elaborate mustache disguise.   Use common sense: if you're stalking your friend at a beach in the hot summer, wear a bathing suit; if you're stalking him/her in the rain, wear a rain jacket and carry an umbrella. If you're stalking at night, wearing dark clothing may help you remain unseen; however, in the event you are spotted you will seem more suspicious. Many people walk/jog/run at night, so athletic clothing may be a good choice. Don't dress flashy: err on the side of muted colors.Don't overthink your attire: dress like everyone else.; , Your friend obviously knows what you look like and how you normally dress, so you'll probably want to alter your appearance slightly.   Depending on how determined you are, you could go to a thrift store and buy some inexpensive clothing so that your friend won't recognize your usual style. Wearing a hoodie can be effective, but it can also make you stand out, particularly when wearing a hoodie up draws attention. If you normally wear your hair a certain way, try styling it differently. If it doesn't feel like you, that's a good thing because it probably doesn't look like you either. If you're not usually a hat person, wearing a hat will definitely make you unrecognizable to your friend at a quick glance. Don't go for an elaborate disguise: less is more in this case. You don't want to draw attention to yourself.  Your friend is going to recognize your face, so consider wearing something to slightly obscure it.   If it's sunny, consider buying a cheap pair of sunglasses to cover your eyes. If it's cold out, wear a scarf that can cover the bottom half of your face. If you wear make-up, perhaps apply it differently, maybe thicker.  In some cases, you may need additional supplies for your stealth operation. Here are some supplies you might consider bringing along in a backpack:   Binoculars. Although good for observing from long distances in nature, in urban areas binoculars will probably stand out. A long-distance lens. A camera with a long-distance lens is good for observing your friend from afar just as long as you're not always focused on him/her: make it look like you're an amateur photographer taking pictures.A spare outfit. If your friend spots you but doesn't recognize you, that's a good time to change your outfit (and personal effects) because if he/she spots you again in the same clothing he/she will definitely become suspicious.  Before you start stalking your friend, think up a reason for why you are where you are. In the event your friend notices and confronts you, this will be your explanation.This is especially important when stalking at night, when there are fewer people around to blend in with and there are fewer reasons to be outside. Here are some ideas for explanations: you dropped something; you're looking for lost pet; you're lost; you're walking home (from somewhere).  Where you're stalking your friend (e.g. a beach, a store, a restaurant) should determine your behavior -- which should appear natural to the environment.   If your friend is shopping, you, too, should appear to be shopping. But if your friend is shopping at store where you might stand out (e.g. for women: a cigar shop; for men: a lingerie shop), then perhaps a better idea would be to wait casually outside for him/her to emerge.If you don't know how to act in a certain place, remember: do what everyone else is doing.  This doesn't mean crouching behind bushes or diving into garbage cans. Rather, use cover appropriately for the situation. Here are some examples:   If you're at a bookstore and your friend is approaching your direction, lower your face into the book as though you were short-sighted. If you're at the park, leaning behind a tree is normal behavior -- so use that tree for cover! If your environment offers no suitable cover, use your phone: hold it low and bow your head to hide your face. People do this all the time, so you'll look normal. Remember that you never know who else might be watching you, so avoid suspicious crouching and hiding even when you think you're unseen.  Even if you're only following your friend walking down the street, appear engaged in either your thoughts or the sights.   Very few people stare straight ahead while they walk, so don't always keep your eyes trained on your friend. As it is seldom done and will likely broadcast your stalking hijinks, eye contact is the wrong kind of engagement, especially with the friend whom you are stalking.  Approaching too closely increases the risk of your friend spotting you, so keep just close enough so that you can always see them.If you're following your friend by car, keep a few car distances behind you and them, with cars in between. Remember, all you need is enough of a distance to see where they're headed and not to lose them if they turn.If you're in nature (e.g. the woods), one way of keeping your distance while observing your friend is to use binoculars or a long-distance camera lens.A greater distance between you and your target might be necessary at night due to the absence of other people.  Rather than a "hawk's gaze," you should keep a "soft focus" on your friend because you don't want to alert suspicion or make eye-contact if they were to turn toward you unexpectedly.   A "soft focus" utilizes your peripheral vision, so that where your nose is pointing isn't necessarily where you're actually looking., Managing the sound you make is most important when you're stalking at night, as there typically are fewer people around at that time.   Walking quietly is largely a matter of balance: keep your legs bent and practice slow, heel-to-toe steps on the outer edge of your feet.Watch where you step so that you don't accidentally step on something, such as a branch, and alert your friend to your presence.  If you see that your friend has spotted and identified you, running away will only raise his/her suspicions when you don't really know if they're even suspicious yet.  Don't overdo it, but be surprised to have run into them. If you're feeling really confident, you could even act like you're delighted to see them, which will probably shake them of the suspicion that you were following them.  When your friend asks why you are where you are, give your explanation that you planned beforehand.  If your friend doesn't believe your planned explanation, your last chance at saving face is to act incredulous at their incredulity. If you get the urge to laugh, let it out because the situation is indeed ridiculous.  If your friend refuses to believe your planned explanation and your incredulity, the jig is probably up and it's time to tell them the truth about what you were doing.	Wear appropriate clothing. Consider a slight disguise. Obscure your face. Bring some supplies. Prepare an explanation. Act appropriately. Use cover casually. Appear engaged. Keep your distance. Keep a "soft focus" on your friend. Be quiet and stealthy. Don't run away. Show surprise. Use your planned explanation. Act incredulous. Tell the truth.
First, make some lemon paste. Then, scrub this paste all over the sippy cups. Pay particular attention to the areas that have a stinky smell. Some parents will even let the lemon paste remain in the cup overnight.To dissolve the lemon paste, rinse it with hot water.  Fill the sink with hot water and squirt a few drops of dishwashing liquid into it. Submerge the sippy cups in the water and wash the cups thoroughly, using the brush that you prefer. Cotton swabs and pipe cleaners are perfect for the small crannies that are hard to reach with a regular brush.   However, avoid using dishwashing soap that will leave an after taste on the sippy cup; your child may refuse to use the cup if it has a bad taste.  Place some denture cleaning tablets in a bowl or container. Full the container with water and immerse the sippy cups in the mixture. Let the cups sit in the water while the tablets fizz.You can purchase denture tablets over-the-counter at your local pharmacy.  Boil the vinegar then put all the sippy cups into it. Soak these cups for a few minutes. Remove and let them cool on a dishtowel.   After this, you can wash them again using a dishwashing soap for a thorough cleaning.  You can do this by putting two to three tablespoons of baking soda into each sippy cup. Fill the inside of the sippy cup with boiling or hot water. Let the baking soda stay in the cup overnight. Wash the cups with water and soap to complete the cleaning process.	Use lemon paste. Wash your sippy cups with dish soap solution. Try using denture cleaning tablets. Wash the sippy cups with vinegar. Use baking soda.
Everyone will find a different method of holding a pencil which feels best. But there are some basics to help you find your sweet spot.   Place the pencil between your forefinger and thumb on your dominant hand. For basic drawing, you don’t want to hold your pencil too close to the tip or you won’t be able to move it enough. Likewise, holding it too far back won’t give you enough control. Try holding it a few centimeters up from the tip. About a fourth of the way up. Keep a loose enough grip so that you can move your fingers, hand, and wrist. When drawing a line, use your fingers. Think if it like a small flicking motion. When drawing a curve or circular shape, use your wrist, while keeping your fingers in place. Though it feels weird a lot of the time, try to keep your pencil connected to the paper. Even when drawing a circle. Lift your wrist off the paper and practice making a continuous loop. Don’t make small jagged lines. A lot of the time, novice artists will make small dashes, trying to connect each one as the pencil progresses. This won’t make your drawing look smooth. Though it may feel weird, and harder to draw longer lines and curves without lifting your pencil, keep practicing. Once you get used to the feeling, your lines will look much better. Sometimes, you want to grip the pencil in your palm when shading. This technique lets you use the edge of your pencil to create a smoother shade and gives you more control on the amount of pressure you apply.; , Most of what you are doing when drawing is using your pen, pencil, or another tool to define the edges and contours of forms. These forms can be anything from a coffee mug on a table, to a superhero flying between tall skyscrapers.   Begin with a pencil. When training yourself to draw, a pencil will be your best friend. You can control how dark or light a line will be. You can also easily erase any mistakes you make and correct your drawings. A lot of what you draw is essentially made up of shapes like circles, ovals, squares, rectangles, and triangles. Your art will incorporate these shapes in different ways to form an image. Practice drawing these shapes. See how well you can sketch out these shapes with a freehand. Get a feel for how your hand moves the pencil on the paper. Keep practicing until you can draw these basic shapes well. Practice shading. Draw a 20 centimetres (7.9 in) x 2 centimetres (0.79 in) rectangle. You can use a ruler if you’d like. Divide your rectangle into boxes which are each 2 centimetres (0.79 in) wide. You will have 10 blocks. Number these blocks going left to right, starting at 1. Leave the first block blank. Then very lightly shade the second block. As you continue to each new block, make it a darker shade until the last box is colored in black. You will now have a shading gradient as a reference guide. , Depending on how realistic you intend your drawing to be, you sometimes want to have hard outlines for your shapes. This is good for a lot of cartoon drawing. For drawing more realistic objects, you may want to use shading to soften your outlines to edges. Outlines are are made by going over the outside lines of your object again with your pencil or pen and tracing over these lines with more pressure to give your object a solid outline and shape. This will make an object look more two-dimensional. Edges are created by shading your object so that the darkest part of the shade is the same as your outline. As you shade farther away from the edge, lighten your shade. This will make your object look more three-dimensional.  Whether you’re an experienced artist, or just starting out, getting back to basics is a great way to improve your drawing skills. A great way to get back to basics is to simply draw what you see around you. As you do, pay attention to light and shading.   Everyone’s seen countless drawings of bowls of fruit or a coffee mug on the table. This is because drawing these objects helps you to understand how to shade an object, incorporate depth, and light. Find something near you like a bowl, fruit, or even your smartphone and practice drawing it on paper. Look at how the light source casts a shadow on and around the object. You can tell where a light source is coming from because the shadow will be pointing opposite the light. Practice drawing an object you are looking at using shapes. Dissect the object and break it down into your basic shapes. If you are looking at a coffee mug, think about the different shapes that make up the mug. The main part of the mug is a cylinder, made up of a rectangle with a curved bottom, and an oval to show the curved top which is open. Practice drawing these shapes together to form the main part of your mug. Next, look at the handle. The handle is like a half circle or oval. Don’t worry about having your lines overlap or not making everything even. You can always erase and adjust. Use your pencil to help you measure the proportions of what you’re drawing. If you line up your pencil to the coffee mug and see that the mug is about ¾ the height of the pencil when your pencil is vertical, and the width of the mug is slightly less the ¾ of the length of the pencil when it’s horizontal, you can use that knowledge to help you get the proportions correct on paper. Once you draw your vertical lines, use your pencil to make sure the distance between the two is relative to the width.  Take some time to read up on the different styles, techniques and ideas that inspired these artists. What about these experiences or techniques excites your interests? There should be plenty of ideas and approaches to enthuse you to learn from.   Books and videos that teach you how to draw using techniques on perspective, construction, anatomy, and color theory will help you hone your own skill. These kinds of material can not only provide you with exercises to practice in a visual way but can also help you discover what kind of drawer you are. These types of reference materials will help you with step-by-step instructions or techniques that you can learn to improve your ability.  Drawing the objects, places, and even things from pop culture you like will help you hone your skill. This is because you will naturally pay more attention to the details of what you are looking at, and take more time when drawing it. Your natural interest in drawing a great rendition of something you like will help you understand how lines and shapes work. How shading is incorporated, and so on.   Draw the cartoons you like. If you like a certain cartoon or comic, and like that art style, practice emulating that style in your own drawings. Drawing your favorite characters in a certain style will give you an idea of what’s easier and harder for you. Perhaps you find that you’re not as good at drawing very realistic objects or characters. But that anime or cartoon styled drawings come much easier.  After you've done some research and practiced drawing what you like, move out of your comfort zone and try other drawing styles. You might feel comfortable with one method of drawing but if you don't try other styles, you'll never know if there are other styles that fit your skills well. Or styles that you can blend into your own mix.   Branching out will help you discover what you are good at and what you are not. You may find that you can draw beautiful, colorful cartoons, but have a difficult time drawing realistic figures. Don’t discount an art style just because you’re not good at it. Keep practicing it and use this as a chance to improve on areas where you are having a hard time. Pick a piece of art or drawing, that is outside of your comfort zone. Then try to recreate it by looking at it. Doing this will give you an idea of where you are having trouble, and it will force you to figure out how to get better. By drawing something that is hard for you, you will train your brain and hand to discover the movements your pencil needs to make. Attempting different drawing styles will also help your own style to emerge naturally over time. You can't force a certain style, it has to develop.  If you have always been drawing in pencil, try charcoal. Or switch to watercolor pencils, colored pencils, or ink.   While a pencil is great for sketching out the first part of a drawing, and sometimes doing the whole drawing, other tools may suit you better. You may find that you have more control with markers, pens, or paint. Or that your personal style really seems to fit a certain medium. Perhaps your style looks ok in just pencil, but once you add a pen, and are able to play with the thickness of the pen’s stroke, you see that your style really comes through.  Artists use colors to evoke a certain mood or atmosphere. Colors are used to create space and light and shadow. Therefore, playing with not only what colors you use in your drawings but how you use these colors, will help you get better and create a style all your own. Look at your favorite comics, cartoons, artists, etc. Notice how color is used in these drawings. Are there bright, happy colors in a shot of Batman as he jumps from a roof in downtown Gotham? Or are the colors darker, more muted? In Batman, the colors are darker and muted to enhance the noir-like tone. Practice with color pencils to get a sense of how your use of color can be incorporated into your drawings. As you use your color pencils, take the time to study your drawing. Does your drawing look better because of the color, or worse? Learn to use color to depict temperature and shades. Blue hues are cooler for example. The darker the blue and the closer to black, the colder the temperature is. , If you truly want to become a better drawer, like every skill, you have to practice, practice, practice. Draw every day, whether it’s a doodle for ten minutes, or a larger piece of art you work on for several hours.   As you continue to draw, you’ll notice where your strengths lie, and where you can improve. Look at your drawings and analyze each one. Take note of what is common throughout your drawings. Are you always drawing cartoons? Or do you frequently only draw part of someone’s body, like the face and head, but never the rest? Spend more time on the types of things you avoid when drawing. If you have a hard time drawing hands, look up tutorials on how to draw hands, and practice drawing just hands over and over. Then, once you’ve improved, incorporate your new skill into your art.  While you may draw pictures that don’t have a human, animal, or human-like figure, chances are a lot of drawings do. Use your own body as a guide.   Say you’re drawing a character you’ve created in action. Picturing and sketching the body in movement, or even standing still, can be tough. It’s not always easy to draw correct proportions or get the placement of body parts right. Position your own body in the pose you are trying to draw. Look at yourself in the mirror or take a picture. Having this kind of reference will help you get a visual understanding of how the body moves, how the arms look in a certain position. What the head looks like when turned at a certain angle.  After mastering the techniques of drawing objects, adding depth, texture and form, the composition is the real telling point of an advanced drawer. The composition can be dull even if your drawing technique is excellent; the real art is found in careful and well-spaced composition. Composition is the spatial relationship of your objects within a frame. Being able to draw with a good sense of space and distance between objects is a skill that takes time. Use real life examples to help you use composition in your art. Say you’re drawing a fence going off into the distance. The gaps between each post will be slightly different. Give objects different sizes and space within your drawing. If you’re drawing a crowd of people, not everyone will be the same height and width. And if some are closer to the eye, or further off in the distance, the size of the person and the detail will vary. Use the rule of thirds. This means dividing your paper into nine equal sections. Your paper is divided horizontally into three sections, and vertically in three sections. Align your areas of focus near the intersections of your imaginary lines. Say you are drawing a person sitting in a chair in a room. You may consider drawing the head in the top left area where your top and left thirds intersect. This is an area of focus and will draw the eye to your person’s face. You might leave the right third of your paper emptier with fewer details and objects to show depth to the room and balance out your drawing.  Some people can draw quickly, and fill in details with ease. But the only way you’ll improve your ability is if you take your time and draw slowly at first. The slower you go the more control you have. You can pay more attention to the slight curve of a line, or get the details of that hand just right.   It may get frustrating to go slowly as you draw, but it makes a big difference. Look at a drawing you did quickly, then go and draw again, this time going slowly, notice the difference. The more you draw, and the more time you take to care for your drawing will be your biggest advantage to becoming a better drawer. Once you’ve learned the basics of drawing, it really comes to down to practice and patience.	Learn to hold your pencil. Practice basic drawing techniques. Practice drawing edges and outlines. Draw what you see around you. Study books and videos about and from famous illustrators. Draw what you like. Attempt different drawing styles. Change medium. Play with color. Draw every day. Use anatomy as a guide. Work on composition. Take your time.
