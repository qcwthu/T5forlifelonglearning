How do I install a second hard drive onto my Windows 98 SE computer? What steps do I have to follow in order to have an extra working hard drive on my computer? Most USB devices require special drivers to use on Win98.  If you want to purchase an external drive, make sure it include Win98 drivers.\n\nOtherwise, you need to pop open your case, and install an internal drive.  Before installing, make sure you have an extra connection on the cable leading to the existing hard drive.  If not, you'll need to purchase a new IDE cable.  Make sure you purchase an 80-pin IDE cable (as opposed to 40-pin) as your drive can only achieve it's best performance with an 80-pin IDE cable\n\nMost cases have the space to add an extra drive internally.  There are two types of drive bays - 5.25" and 3.5".  Since all desktop hard drives are 3.5" use one of these if possible.  Otherwise you can purchase a rail kit to adapt a 3.5" drive to 5.25".\n\nNext comes the drive settings.  Your current drive may either be set for Master or Cable Select.  Usually there are a series of jumpers next to where the drive connects to the power cord (4-pin) and/or cable leading to the controller (on the motherboard).  On some drives, they're marked MA, SL, or CS.  If not it may indicate on the top of the drive.  If the drive is MA(ster), you need to set your new drive for SL(ave).  If it's CS (cable select), set yours for CS.  Plug your drive into the empty connector on the same cable that connects to your hard drive.\n\nI would recommend connecting hard drives in series instead of putting a hard drive on the same cable as your CD/DVD drive.  IDE can only perform as well as the slowest device on the cable.  Since CD/DVD drives are typically slower than hard drives, your new drive won't be able to achieve it's maximum performance.\n\nThat's usually it.  Your system BIOS should automatically detect the drive.  You can either use Windows to partition and format the drive, or, if your new drive included a setup utility, use the disk that came with the drive.  Since you're using Windows98 you must setup the drive to use a FAT32 partition as Win98 does not support NTFS, and FAT has a limit of 2GB.	computers and internet

Why I can t get any names to show  in my chat  friends list ?  I am assuming that you're talking about the yahoo messenger.\n\nIt could be that you've your friends in the ignore list or reported as spam , hence you will not be able to add them. If this is the case then you wouldn't be able to invite others ; some error would show up.\n\nThere's another possibility (only if you can successfully add ppl as your friend but they just don't show up in the list ) that you've unchecked the option -  "Show offline contacts" . In this case only the online friends would show up. This can be undone as follows :\n\nY!Messenger -- > Contacts ---> Check the option - "Show Offline Contacts".\n\nLastly, you might have checked the option "Show Address Book" instead of "Show Messenger List" in the contact tab fo yahoo messenger. This can be corrected as follows :\n\nY!Messenger -- > Contacts ---> Check the option - "Show Messenger List".	computers and internet

Who knows something about Steaua Bucharest?  FC Steaua Bucureşti is a Romanian football club based at Ghencea Stadium, Bucharest, Romania. It was founded on June 7, 1947 as ASA Bucureşti (Asociatia Sportivă a Armatei - English The Army Sport Association). The club changed its name several times before settling on Steaua (English: "The Star") in 1961.\n\nBeing the only Romanian football team and the first in Eastern Europe, to win the European Champions Cup in 1986, having also won the European Super Cup in 1987, Steaua is the most successful and the most popular football club in Romania. Alongside the two European trophies, they have also won 23 National Football Championships, 20 Romanian Cups and 5 Romanian Super Cups	sports

What are the rules/scoring stuff for football? I'm curious and clueless. Objective: American football is played by two teams who will have eleven players on the field at any one time. The object of the game is to get the ball to the opponents end of the field, and score more points than the opposing team.\n\nTo start a game, the referee will toss a coin. The visiting captain calls. The winner of the toss can decide whether to start in offense (receive the kick) or defense (deliver the kick). When play restarts in the second half, the captain who lost the toss at the beginning of the game chooses.\n\nIf a game goes into overtime, the first team to score wins, so the captain will almost always choose to go on the offense. Teams change ends at the start of the quarter.\n\nPlaying time lasts for one hour, divided into four fifteen minute quarters. There is a fifteen minute break between the second and third quarters (each half of the game).\n\nThe clock is stopped when the ball is not in play, when a foul has been committed, or when a fair catch has been caught. The clock is also stopped for time outs. Both teams are allowed three time outs, lasting a maximum of two minutes each, in each half.\n\nBoth the clock and the game itself are stopped two minutes from the end of each half by the referee to allow the teams to plan their strategies.\n\nIf the scores are level at the end of the fourth quarter, overtime will be played. In NFL games, only one period of overtime is played, and if the scores are still level, the game is declared a draw. For championship and playoff games, periods are played until a winner is decided (the first team to score).\n\n\n\n\nMORE COMPLEX RULES\n\n\n\nKick off \nTop of page\n\nPlay starts with a kick off at the start of the second half, but when the teams turn around and change ends at the start of the first and third quarters, play is started from the same position on the field as where it finished, but in the opposite half of the field. The same team will keep possession.\n\nThe kick-off is used to restart play after all point-afters and field goals. The kick-offs are always taken from the 35-yard line, unless a penalty has been given. The team making the point after always restarts the game with a kick-off. If the kick is unsuccessful, the defense starts play from their own 25-yard line and so they become the offense.\n\n\n\nScoring \nTop of page\n\nAs with many sports, the object is to score more points than the opponents. There are several different ways of scoring in American football.\n\nThe largest single score comes from a touchdown. This is worth six points. It is scored when an offensive player runs into the opposing end zone while in possession of the ball. A receiver can also make a catch delivered into the same area. The ball does not have to be actually 'touched down' on the ground for the points to be scored.\n\nA successful touchdown is followed by a kick through the goalposts, known as the conversion, or 'point-after'. This is worth one point. For this, the ball is placed on the 2-yard line and snapped (passed backwards through the legs) to the kicker, who tries to kick it over the crossbar and between the upright posts.\n\nA player can touch the ball onto the ground in the end zone without their whole body being in the end zone, and the touchdown still counts. However, the scoring player must not be pushed or helped in any way by other players.\n\nThe next type of scoring is called the field goal. A field goal counts as three points. It is taken from 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage (the line where the last play ended, so the next play is made from there), to give the kicker more time, and some protection from the defense. Again, the ball must be kicked through the posts. The kicker is credited for the kick from whatever distance it was taken from.\n\nThe fourth and final way of scoring is called the safety. Two points are awarded to the offensive team when the defensive team are caught in possession of the ball in their own end zone.\n	sports

How to increase my height?

Hi Amir, three factors that affect your growth rate are as follows :\n\n(1) Your Genes\n(2) Your Pituitary Gland\n(3) Your Nutrition\n\nThe Pituitary gland sits as the bottom of the middle of your brain. Its secrets various harmones, one of them including the growth harmone. Growth hormone is the key factor that controls how tall you grow to be, and the amount of it that gets produced can vary from year to year and even month to month as you grow.\n\nNutrition can help, in the sense that undernourishment can cause growth to go more slowly. Eat well-balanced meals, with protein, vegetables, and all the vitamins and minerals you need.\n\nYou certainly can't control your genes, but with a well balanced diet, you centainly can suppliment the rate of increase. The only limiting factor is your age. By 19 years, the growth of an average person stops. There are medicines available in the market, but I am certainly not in favour of using those. In case you want to , consult your doctor before using those.\n\nJust a note:\nScientists have cloned the gene for human growth hormone, and so the purified factor is now available for doctors to use. But they only use it in special medical cases where severely low levels of growth hormone can cause problems. \n\nFor a detailed explaination of how to increase your height, check out the following articles :\n\nhttp://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=96896\nhttp://www.teenhealthfx.com/answers/Sports/15469.html	health

If you have felt sad most of your life, is that depression? Most of my life, even as a child, I have felt an overall sadness.  Sometimes it gets worse and sometimes better.  I have taken medication for it and had counseling but none seem to make a difference.  All of the screening tests ask if you feel worse in the last 2 weeks, well I never felt any better so no I don't feel worse.  Do I enjoy activities less?  Never enjoyed them that much.  Have I considered suicide. Decided a long time ago that I did not want to put family through that.  Is this depression or just a personality disorder?  Where do I go for help? I have had a drinkin problem in the past but have overcome it, mostly due to social situation.  I now overeat and am trying to overcome that. Perhaps you need to look at your childhood and what you were sad about.  They say that depression is "anger turned inwards". Were you abused, molested, traumatised or experienced great loss in some way as a child? Keep in mind that things we adults would take in our stride can be overwhelming or seem life-threatening to a child. And there will be long-term emotional effects even if we then block, forget or repress those childhood feelings. \n\nDrinking and overeating are both ways to numb one's emotional pain. I think you may need to understand the source of that pain before you can try to heal it. \n\nHave you been to many different counselors or just one? Keep trying them out till you find one you relate to .. it's a bit like shopping for clothes with the size-labels cut off .. you've got to try them out to know for sure if they fit for you! :)   In my experience the most helpful ones have been therapists who practise CBT or Transactional Analysis (CBT is cognitive behavioural therapy).\n\nPerhaps if you work on reducing fatigue and increasing your energy, that might help some. Try drinking plenty of water, eating fresh fruit and veg, breathing and stretching exercises, go for walks in the fresh air, and get about 7 to 8 hrs sleep. Oversleeping can make you feel just as tired if not more, than insomnia. There are lots of simple things you can, mostly with your lifestyle, to reduce the impact of your depression and feel better about life.	health

i have a presentation on distribution channels of bata so give m contents?  I hope you are looking for info only on Bata India and not its overseas operations. \n\nBata India markets its products through three distinct channels.\n\n1. Company operated retail outlets\n\nThe Company operates its own retail network of over 1,100 retail stores spread across the country. These outlets are serviced through six distribution centres spread out geographically and each responsible for a particular region. \n\nThe process flow begins with the transportation of the finished products from the Company’s manufacturing units and contract manufacturers’ plants to the distribution centres through the services of third party carrying and forwarding agents. The distribution centres in turn transport these products to the Company operated retail outlets based on specific demand requirements. These retail outlets are manned by the Company’s employees and exclusively market the Company’s footwear brands.\n\nAs part of its strategy to provide complete footwear solutions to customers, the retail outlets also market accessories like shoes laces, socks, shoe polish. In certain outlets, the Company also provides cosmetic services like pedicures, etc. \n\nOut of the 1,100 retail stores, the Company has designated 84 stores as factory outlets which are used to sell merchandise at marked down prices. These factory outlets are used primarily by the Company to sell surplus or non-moving products and factory seconds stocks.\n\nInstitutional sales as well as supplies to the civil and defence agencies are also taken care of through the Company’s distribution network. The Company has designated specific senior managers to oversee the marketing to this segment of buyers. The requirements are directly supplied from the Company’s distribution centres.\n\n2. Dealer Network\n\nThe Company also uses the dealer network of the footwear industry to market its products. Through this channel, the Company supplies its products to non-exclusive wholesale distributors who in turn distribute the Company’s products to independent dealers across the country. The dealers covered under this channel are non-exclusive Bata dealers and hence sell footwear and related products of other companies also.\n\n3. Market Extension Programme\n\nThe Company is undertaking steps to generate volume business in semi-urban markets and markets which are unrepresented and under-represented footwear markets, pursuant to its Market Extension Programme, through authorised Bata dealerships. Under this programme, the Company appoints authorised dealers, subject to certain selection criteria who run outlets which exclusively market the Company’s products and adhere to rules and regulations of the Company.\n\nAs on date, there are 470 such outlets in the country. The dealer outlets are not manned by Bata employees but are manned by the employees of the private dealer.	business

What is in your bank account cannot possibly verify your income, that is via your employment.  Never give your bank account info and address over the phone to anyone asking for it.  If you feel that you are being hassled, just tell them "I'll call you in a few minutes" and hangup.  Then call the company they were claiming to be and report it.  That is the only way that these people can be caught is if people report it each time it happens.	business

whats the best way to defend ourself? can you suggest any home made instrument? The best defense is your mind.  Stay out of situations where the temper would escalate to violence.  If you use words and your brain, you can get out of almost any bad situation without coming to blows.  \n\nIf you absolutely *have* to defend yourself from imminent physical assault, remember that the law favors even-handed responses, meaning don't defend yourself with a deadly weapon unless you're threatened with one.	business

how can there not be a God?  If you truly do not believe in something then, to you, it does not exist - truth is the perception of the individual.\n\nSince there are countless religions with varying ideas of 'god' then they cannot all be 'right' in a strict sense.\n\nI personally do not believe (or feel the need to believe) in  a God - this, however, does not stop a God existing for you.\n\nPeace out.	science

Is centrifugal force gravity? Sounds funny, I know.  A friend of mine INSISTS he saw or read somewhere that centrifugal force and gravity are one and the same.  But the more I think on it the more it doesn't make sense.  It seems to me that they should be opposites. No centrifugal force is not gravity. Gravity is a real force, and centrifugal force is a fictitious force. Centrifugal force usually works in a direction OPPOSITE to gravity. \n\nCentrifugal force is the force we invent in a moving frame to explain what appears to be a force pushing out from the center of rotational motion (but it is just the law of inertia, really, not a force). For example, if you spin a rock tied to a rope, the rope stretches out as the rock spins. It looks like there is a force pulling the rock outward; this is the fictitious force, centrifugal force. While the rope is holding the rock in the circular path, the rope is pulling the rock in to the center of the motion, so the tension on the rope is providing the opposing force, called centripetal force. \n\nIn the case of the earth, gravity from the sun provides a centripetal force to hold the earth in a roughly circular orbit around the sun (or actually around the center of mass, and the orbit is elliptical). So the centripetal force is gravity, and centrifugal force is the apparent force, but fictitious, that makes the earth appear like it wants to fly off into space, if gravity was not there. If the sun's gravity just shut off, the earth would travel off into space, and an observer on the sun would say it looked like a force was pulling the earth outward away from the sun. We call this force centrifugal force.	science

How to obtain sugary crystals of about 1mm for Ferrous ammonium sulfate? I am trying to obtain uniform sugary crystals of ferrous ammonium sulfate hexahydrate. However crystallisation on cooling yields crystals of various sizes. 80% being crystalline powder, 10 % sugary crystals & rest 10% large chunky crystals. Could anyone suggest for increasing yield of sugary crystals.? Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 .6H2O is highly insoluble in non polar organic solvents like chloroform, dichloromethane, etc. Might be slightly soluble in alcohols. Better you dissolve it in minimum amount of water (make highly saturated solution) and add drop by drop alcohol  in a period of time and keep aside without shaking. Crystals will grow slowly.\nIt might be helpful.	science

Phenylketonuria? Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease caused by a recessive allele. If a woman has this disease, and her husband is heterozygous for this disease, what is the probability that their first child will be a phenotypically normal one?\nA) 1/4\nB) 1/2\nC) 1/16\nD) 1 Do a punnet (sp?) square.  If the mom has it, that's pp (let P = dominant normal and p = recessive disease)\n\nDad is heterozygous, meaning he's Pp\n\nSo pp x Pp has four results:\n___p___ p\nP__Pp__Pp\np__pp__pp\n\nSo the 4 results are two Pp and two pp.  Phenotypically normal will be any presence of P, since the disease is recessive.\n\nErgo, 1/2 chance.  B is correct.	science

Is it better to stay at a state college for four years or to transfer to a private university after two years? The state college isnt very well known but the private one is. Given the context of the state college not being very well known, and the private university being well known (presumably in the field that you wish to study), I would say you should go to the private university after two years.\n\nI went to a private university for four years, and although I enjoyed every second of my time there, the classes for the first two years could have been taken at a community college and I probably would have taken away more of an understanding than I did at the private school.  If you are just completing general education requirements in your first two years, you might as well get them out of the way as inexpensively as possible, so that you maximize the worth of your educational dollars.\n\nBest of luck to you!	education and reference

I think my husband is interested in another woman? We have been married 3yr and I went home to make some money and organise my things cos I have been living with my husband o/seas which I dont have a visa to work in, I am only allowed to be there cos of him.  I came back and he was acting weirdly, he started complaining about everything the food I cooked, the house was undtidy(which it wasnt) he eats food all over the house esp on my computer which was a gift.  He complained I spent to much money on food so he stopped giving me money.  I spoke to my dr whom is a bit psychic & he told me he was interested in a woman at work.  I looked up his work place and ended up going into another page but I found this woman whom I thought fitted perfectly to him, anyway a week later I called my dr and he said this woman had a b/f & didnt want to breakup for him & this coincided with my husband telling me he wanted to give me another chance so we can make things better.  He blames me 4 everything & calls me a leach & tells me I have to do wot he says there is more going on there than you think if it stays this way for while you need to let it go. because if he really wanted you and loves you he wouldnt be treating you like that. i would try to give your best shot and if nothing works i would leave and try to start your life over. if by chance your leaving scares him silly and he changes his ways then i would search your heart and see if you really want him back.	family and relationships

What is the point of refugees? Why exactly are refugees so accepted in Canada? Honastly, what do they do that helps the country? They are mostly uneducated people, who go on welfare right away. Waht is the point?! Maybe I am missing something, but PLEASE no answers saying that "we have to be humanistarian and theyre also people and we have to help them". WHO SAID?! They live in a screwed up country, either stay there or bring and contribute to the country you are coming to. Please tell me if I am missing anything. actually studies show that refugees are not infact the ones who are abusing Canada's welfares system. i've been studying about refugees in canada and although you may think that they are depleting Canada's resources they are infact not. they are the ones who are willing to do the crappy jobs that no one else in wants. why would you want them to stay in a country that is "screwed up" anyhow?\n\nWhat facts are you basing this on? you are generalizing to an entire religion based on a few members of this religions who are extremists.  Just because you say that you're not being racist doesn't mean that you aren't.\n\nNot sure where you are getting your "facts" from. But from a previous question that you posted it seems to me that you are a bit confused over the actual statistics of Canadian immigration.  You claim that Canada lets in more refugees than independant immigrants which is infact false. In the year 2002 Canada actually let in a total of 25,111 refugees compared to 136,525 economic immigrants.  In fact Canada let in 203,947 immigrants in total that year.  You also seem to be confused as to why Canada needs immigrants. Canada has a low birth rate and a high death rate. Therefore without immigration we would experience a serious deline in the population.  In order for Canada to be economically stable we need more people. Immigrants bring more to this country that they take.  They actually do create more jobs and are less likely than their Canadian born counterparts to rely on social assitance such as welfare.	politics and government

Have you ever been hit by a oblivious motorist while riding your bicycle? I was today, and it really changed my attitude toward the world of motorists.  This is what happened; I was riding my bike to school this morning to take a History test.  When I arrived at the cross street that my school resides, I pushed the "request to walk" button on the light pole, and after I recieved my walking man sign I attempted to simply cross the street.  Then a completely oblivious old lady almost slowly crushed me while I was pinned on my bike.  She was not too old, about 50-55, and she was looking at the guy on the median handing out church flyers, instead of looking forward.  She creeped to a short-lived stop on the big white line, and began to creep forward more.  Before I knew it her car was pushing me over, and  about to (slowly) roll right over me.  The only reason this lady FINALLY stopped was because in my rage I began to pound the crap out of her hood.  I went to her window, and commanded, "ROLL YOUR F*CK'N WINDOW DOWN".  The next sound I heard was the doors lock! And THAT would be why all people over the age of 50 should be required to take a driving test, written exam, and eye exam every 2 years.	politics and government

When you quote someone EXACTLY, how can he come back and say you misquoted him? John Kerry's quote: "You know, education--if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework, and you make an effort to be smart, uh, you can do well. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq."\n\nVideo of the Poodle's quote\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLuMWiQ6r2o\n\nMrs. Heinz's husband accusing the White House of DISTORTING his statement: "My statement [Monday]--and the White House knows this full well--was a botched joke about the president and the president's people, not about the troops. The White House's attempt to distort my true statement is a remarkable testament to their abject failure in making America safe." Because once a liar always a liar and John Kerry has and always be a liar	politics and government

explain what is law of agency. give me one relevant example.? law of agency Agency law is concerned with any "principal"-"agent" relationship; a relationship in which one person has legal authority to act for another. Such relationships arise from explicit appointment, or by implication. The relationships generally associated with agency law include guardian-ward, executor or administrator-decedent, and employer-employee. \n\nThe law of agency is based on the Latin maxim "Qui facit per alium, facit per se," which means "he who acts through another is deemed in law to do it himself." Agency, in its legal sense, nearly always relates to commercial or contractual dealings	politics and government

Can free-will and god's will co-exist? Whenever something bad happens and a person asks how can god let this happen, the usually answer is god's plan or mostly god's will, yet when a person does something bad for example the terrorist flying the planes into the World Trade Center and ask why did god let this happen, the answer usuallu is free-will.  So which is it? I think God has had to let His will come second to ours, thats why there is so much crap in this world	society and culture

how is there black people who are hispanic? where did the rwo groups meet? If you mean "hispanic" from Puerto Rico, Mexico, Dominican, etc., it's a result of the slave trade. There are enclaves of blacks in Mexico, for example, who were brought over during the slave trade and left there. Eventually blacks and hispanics intermingles and mixed and you get some of the people you see today.\n\nThere is a Mexican Museum of Fine Arts here in Chicago that is currently running an exhibit about the African presence in Mexico.\n\nhttp://www.mfacmchicago.org/	society and culture

Does your government really give a damn about you? Does your church? Does your Mom?  From where I stand I think the Government doesnt care  a crap that our people are getting killed and why not let these countries fight thier own wars why do we get involved ? As for as the Church I think that if you pay your dues and help maintain the church and there everytime the doors are open then yest they care they wont beable to count on your money to help cover the next crusade if you arent there and take your money else where . As for as my mother I am begining to wonder . I know she cares and all but LOVE I dont think my mother will ever know what true love will be . Standards being placed on someone isnt love ! To show favortisum isnt love to act in a way that makes others feel bad isnt love !	society and culture

If sex before marriage is a sin, is it ok if you never marry?  God says to "be fruitful & multiply." I honestly do not remember seeing  ANYWHERE in the Bible that you have to be married 1st. The only thing I recall is that we are supposed to be monogamous & commit ourselves to our mate until death. Does that mean that we have to be married in the conventional sense? I don't know. Maybe this whole formal marriage thing was put in place to deepen the commitment.	society and culture
