Why is he mad at me? My Ex bf dumped me last month.  We told each other that we loved each other and wanted to spend the rest of our lives together.  We didn't fight, we got along great.  We had amazing chemistry and loved to talk about anything.  We had a lot in common, ect... then his ex gf asked him to come back to her.  They dated off and on for a year and a half.  So, he chickened out on me and ran back to her.  I was devestated and can not understand how he would give up what we had.  He claims that she is the love of his life.  BUT.... I know this isn't true.  I know that he told other people how he felt about her when they last dated, and he told me the same thing.  He said she was "comfortable" and he could marry her, "why not".  With me, he said he loved me like no other, but that he was afraid that love was just blind.... What the heck?  Anyhow, I was having a hard time and thought that I should remind him how I felt and that I wanted him to come back. In the beginning, I texted him and emailed him a lot.  Then a couple weeks later, he got mad at me.. I asked him if he was mad at me because we were going to try to be friends. He said, "Yes, I asked you to leave me alone.  Please leave me alone".  I was reallyl shocked because he never asked me to leave him alone.  So, I went to his house, after not seeing him for two weeks.  I talked to him.  He admitted that he loved me still, but he made his choice.  He claimed it wasn't easy since he loved everything about me, but he had a "history" with her.  So, we talked, I kissed him on the cheek and I told him I would wait, then left.  He nodded with his eyes swollen and full of tears.  I thought that was a good sign.  So, two weeks after that, I find out they are gonna get married next month.  I was like, wow, he really should not do that.  I sent him an annonomous text message saying , "You don't marry the one you can live with, you marry the one you can't live without". I think it's a big mistake to marry her just so he won't be alone.  So, he texted me back saying I was a harrassing, psychotic stalker!  Wow, I was shocked again. I mean, I have left him alone like he asked for two weeks.  I didn't think sending a text message constitutes a stalker. So, I know he is reallyl angry at me.   I just don't know why?  Is it because he knows it's true and he doesn't want to be reminded, or does he really all of a sudden hate me and want me completely out of his life, when we had said we would be friends down the line. I think that he is torn between 2 different women and he had to decide to choose--- unfortunately he did not choose you.  The other women is probably controlling and has talked him into getting married.  I would say he does not want to talk to you any more b/c of the simple fact that he is ashamed, doesn't want to hurt you anymore and because he probably b/c he also doesn't want to hurt this other girl.  Just give it sometime and see what pans out more than likely if there wedding is a ways off she will probably leave him like she did before... at that point in time if he truly loved you he will come back to you b/c he will have realized what he lost.  I would say even though he is saying hurtful and mean things more than likely he isn't mad at you and is only doing what he is doing b/c he is ashamed of what he did or the crazy other women could have his cell phone and is texting it without his knowledge.  Anyways good luck and if you do happen to find another great guy in the mean time at least give them a chance maybe all of this just happened for a reason.	family and relationships

What are the best colors for a fall wedding?  Autumn is a beautiful time to get married! I love Indian Summers - (is it still politically correct to say that? I don't want to seem insensitive. ;-)\n\nI would say: (1) a deep, rich wine or plum color or (2) moss green or (3) a beautiful earthenly champagne color. Have you ever seen the pictures of Cindy Crawford in a champagne-colored dress when she was a bridesmaid/attendant for one of her model friends? That is the color I am thinking of and it was stunning! I hope you know what I mean. It was in People Magazine a few years ago.\n\nLast year, I attended a late fall wedding in Sicily, Italy. The reception was held in a castle. The attendants had shimmery gold, rustic brown and forest green dresses. Each one was a different color and it was gorgous beyond gorgous. Coupled with the massive wrap-around outdoor terrace, the Greek-syle columns in this place, cashmere walls and paintings worth a small fortune, a luxury yacht moored in the Meditteranean with little blinking strings of light everywhere, right off the grounds....it was like a fairy-tale. I know this is a bit much that most people can afford but I have no idea of your income / means.\n\nHere is another idea that may be hard to envision but someone I know did their entire wedding in black & white. I must admit I thought it was not a good idea - but it was done with class and luxury and was the most beautiful wedding I have ever seen. All the guests agreed. I know the wedding planner of that one if you need some tips!\n\nYou can have a beautiful wedding on any budget. Love is the magical ingredient that makes it all beautiful. Often times, too much emphasis is put on the wedding and not enough on the marriage. Congratulations and best wishes on entering this exciting phase of your life! Good luck!	family and relationships
My daughters are going to come out in a wedding, they wiil be holdind the tail of the brides dress.? What are they called? Are they bridal girls? it's not common anymore - but in England, it used to be a tradition to have young boys and/or girls "carry" the train in formal weddings. This was generally because they were so long (think Princess Di). \n\nThey could be called page boys, bridal attendants, flower girls, etc. I did attend one wedding were this was done, and the wedidng had an angel theme, so the girls were called Angel Attendants and each wore a small pair of white angel wings.	family and relationships

How would it affect the people who love me if I go through the star gate to Atlantis?  If you were selected to go through the Earth Stargate to the Pegasus Galaxy, then you should feel proud, as only the best and brightest are selected for such a journey.\n\nBut make no mistake, this will be no joyride.  With an active foe such as the Wraith, your demise could be far worse than death.  As such, those who love you may worry for your survival in the far-off city of Atlantis.  That is, if they have the security clearance to know where you are going and what you will be up against.\n\nIn the end, how a decision like this will affect those you love you depends entirely upon your resolve and sturdiness.  It would only affect then if you did not make it back.  So press forward with your best, and tell them you're going fishing in Minnesota.	family and relationships

So do you think it would be too weird to date MY GYNECOLOGIST? We have talked a lot. He's always finding a reason to phone me. When I go to his office we talk about US and finally He asked me out. I think he's the nicest man I've met, I had a c-section with him, he loves my baby, and I met him when I was pregnant. I like him but I thought he would be just a doctor to me and I thought he was just being nice to me until I realize that he was very interested about ME and finally he asked me out. I really like him. I'm 22 and he's a lot older than I, he's very nice, but what do you think about me dating my gynecologist, I sometimes think it would be weird, now he wants me to be more than only his patient He is breaking his code of ethic's. But heck doesnt everyone!!\nI would say go for it. As long as he is not married. Older men are the best they treat you better and are more settled down and less jealous. As long as you are ready to settle down and be okay with that.. My husband is 20 years my senior and we have been together for 10 yrs.. good luck and have fun	family and relationships

Can long distance relationships work out if the couple only sees each other once a week?  Of course it can.  Think of it this way.  You can get away from your world and into his and vice versa.  You have two cities to explore.  Love is bonding, do you trust yourself? Do you trust him?  The draw back is these darn gas prices.	family and relationships
Are hot flashes or episodes a possible early sign of pregnancy? ttc, 12dpo, no menstral cycle signs but have been overly warm and emotional the  last couple days.

How would I go about getting over my boyfriend of 5 years attempting to cheat on me and re-learn to trust him?  Silly me... I've tried that and failed... I guess my lightbulb just went off and I've come to this conclusion:\n\nRelationship is a trail to see if you're ment to be together forever.  You should be looking for someone who makes you happy <you need to define happiness 4 yourself> above all else...if it doesn't work out, then you can only look at the way you behaved, and try to make yourself better; DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP IN THIS PROCESS!!! You should be look for happiness alone if this is where you take yourself.\n\nMy friend just broke up with her feionce <SP??? Future husband>, and he won't take her dog... Now, she's moved into a tiny apartment <from a house> and she's got this massive dog.  She loves this dog, and it gives her happy feelings about the past relationship...however, she is consumed by guilt for keeping the doggie in a small space.  Concequently, she's always yelling at the doggie because of the guilt.  I realized my cheeting ex was treating me this way...he brought a new girl into his heart, now there wasn't enough room, and I got yelled at because he felt guilty...\n\nI finally got the light and "Drop kicked him to the curve".  Yeah, I'm free, and finally away from negitivity, so I'm getting happy again...I still long for the good old days, but recognize, they're in the past.	family and relationships

I love my husband but i want him bad. switching jobs is not and an option. help me. You and him are both married.  There should be no questions about the issue.  When u got married, u agreed to love and honor your husband til death do you part.  So if you want to be an adultress then go ahead but i think thats shady.  The other guy also is being shady.	family and relationships
why do i still have feelings for my ex?  Just because the two of you have broken things off, doesn't mean that your feelings will automatically shut off the moment things end. As long as you are honest with yourself then you can deal with your feelings, if you know there's no chance of getting back together then take some time out for you and then move on to someone else because time does heal all wounds, and when you meet someone else you can create new memories. Good luck	family and relationships

Can you advise me on a family problem I am having? My sister and I were seperated at birth when our mom died.  Our dad was an abusive guy and contributed to our mom's death.  The authorities took us and gave us way to foster parents.  My sister ended up living with wealthy influential people while I grew up with aunt and uncle on a farm.  \n\nDue to strange circumstances and problems with the government my sister and I came together not knowing each other.  I thought she was hot not knowing who she was but she was in love with some pilot.  Even after we figured out that we were related I still think she is hot.  \n\nI have to go face our evil dad now.  He is a high up officer in the military now.  \n\nShould I persue a relationship with my sister or just turn gay and be with her boyfriend pilot's buddy?  He is a big hairy guy and needs to shave but is kind of cute in his way.

Define Soulmate or soul to soul, it's importance  to love?  Soulmate to me means that I can start a sentence and he finishes it just they way I would have. Or to say the exact same thing at the same time. You share your love for each other and you feel complete with that person. You love being together even if its just watching TV or cleaning house. You share your thoughts and dreams and always understand what each other is feeling. You have trust, communication, and respect for each other. You never doubt that they love you and they never doubt that you love them back. It is a feeling of complete peace with each other. That is what a soulmate is.	family and relationships

What is Velehrad (Czech) famous for?  Hi, Velehrad (meaning Big Castle) is one of the most important  pilgrim sites in the Czech Republic. The place belonged to the Great Moravian Empire to where St Cyril and St Methodius brought alphabet and the Bible in a Slavonic language so the locals would understand it. They actually brought Christianity to the Moravian part of what today is the Czech Republic.\nThere is a huge complex of church buildings including monastery (belonging among the biggest European ones) in Velehrad, originating from 13th century. There are pics of the interiors and exteriors here: http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:_f7X2WicmSkJ:www.ado.cz/poutni/velehrad/velehrad.htm+Velehrad&hl=cs&ct=clnk&cd=3, http://www.velehrad.cz/vel1.html\nYou can read about it in English here: http://www.heartofeurope.cz/regions_5.html	family and relationships

Is it intimidating or should we spare you the worry and just ask ? some do some dont depends on the person  if i like a girl i ussaly ask her out first but it is a intresting felling wene the girl asks you first  but somtimes it can be annoying depending on how  they do it  wene they send a letter or a message it pisses me off but if they say it to my face ime ok with it cause they have taken to time to approch me and ask me and i have alot of respect for people like that but some people are shy so you might wanna aproch them outside school/work were ever and talk to them but some are that shy they will feel embarrest and try to get out the convo so sit down  and make it feel like a good convosation not a interagation  and make sure your to the point but in a nice way cause if your hinting it on they could get scared and not know what your getting at but the best advice i can give is observe who they are first if there shy approch him sepperate  or if hes ok with thing just see him straight up but it depends on the person look and think before you act i hope this helps  same goes wene asking chicks out if you got any more questions just email me at mrbisket@hotmail.com	family and relationships

What to do with a schizophrenic friend?? I have a friend who i've known since I was 14. I'm 26 now. A year ago he ended up in the psych ward at the hospital. All of his friends abandoned him, his father died when he was 9 and his mom has mental issues of her own. He lives in a tiny 1 room apt. now, no t.v, no radio, nothing except a bible. I run into him sometimes and feel guilty. I've visited him and called a few times, but I never know what to say. And now that I know he's been diagnosed as schizophrenic, my other friends tell me to just forget about him. But that's not me. What would you do?? PERSONAL EXPERIANCE HAS TUAGHT ME ONE THING\nseeing your friends go trhough a downward spiral is no easy task...but\n\nFirst And Foremost You need to ask YOURSLEF a serious qeustion.. \n\nAre you considering it to actually help him out, and i mean REALLY help him out? or are you wanting to help your freind because you feel guilty about not helping him? \n\nYes i am being serious...and yes they are two COMPLETELY different things.... either you want to help him out becuase you feel as though you have a responsibillity as a person of society to help him with his ordeal, OR you want to make YOURSELF feel better, and get the moral dilema off your concious....\n\nThe reason this quesiton is important, is that it will do more damage to him if, when it gets difficult and time/money consuming (and it WILL), that you find that its not worth spending months/ years devoted to helping him trhough the ordeal, and fade out of his life. \n\nIf you have read this, thought about it, and really thought about it, and still have in mind to help him, i'd say just be the freind that you are, becuase a person who would be willing to do the above knowing the sacrifices one would have to make wouldn't need to do anything else to help your friend out in his hard times.	family and relationships
How should we solve our differences in religion around the holidays? My husband is a member of the worldwide church of God and I am christian.  He doesn't celebrate Christmas or Easter because he believes that they are mixing pagan and christian beliefs (he doesn't believe in anything pagan).  He also doesn't eat seafood or pork because in his religion they are "unclean foods".  I have celebrated christmas and easter with my six year old all her life and we eat pork and seafood.  We were just married and have agreed to disagree on the subject, but he refuses to have a christmas tree in sight and will not participate whatsoever.  How can I celebrate these traditions with my daughter while keeping everyone comfortable and drama to a minimum?  How can we "agree to disagree" and still keep our personal traditions intact? Perhaps you should remind him that Christianity is a religion of love, and by rejecting all these things, he is instead spreading a message of hatred and intolerance. Also, remember that story of the good Samaritan? Well, the Samaritans were Pagan	family and relationships

We might be incompatible, we might be perfect for eachother. Woah, woah...slow down, man.  Get to know her more.  Take her out for nachos or something.  Get to know her thoughts, her dreams, and stuff.  Find out who she really is.  I am sure she is wonderful, she sounds lovely.  So take that step out of your comfort zone and talk to her.  Then you will know for sure whether you are perfect for eachother or incompatable.\nHope this helps.  Good luck.\nNanny G.	family and relationships
Need help! :s Ladies please.. give your opinion.? Hi there =) !\nSo my situation is I met a girl in a party from university (2 months ago) and we start to talk like friends. I've asked her to go out for a coffee but only a month after i invited her she finnaly have time to go on a date (in my opinion she was testing me and testing if she was really atracted for me). The date was good, we talk and laugh for like 4 hours without stop. I know she is atracted to me but it seems to me that she is a little shy when she see me in the university. She's like the kind of girl who knows a loooot of ppl because she's really sweet with everybody, but not the kind of girl that go out with much guys, and with me she's shy. So my problem is how to get the girl :)\nI really like her like no other girl I've ever have fallen in love. Today I was talking with some other girls and when she arrived I was testing her and it seems to me that she was jealous. Is that a good sign? We have saturday an exam. Should I ask her to study together? Thanks :) well trying to make her jelous and acting like you are interested in a bunch of other girls is immature and mean.  If you truly love her, you won't do things like that.  Just keep going slow.  At least she has morals and isn't trying to sleep with you and marry you on  the first date.  Just keep talking to her, getting to know her, make her feel comfortable.  Ask her to study and have a nice picnic or nice dinner while you study.  Be romantic and take your time.  IF you love her she is worth it.  BUT quit acting immature and palying games.	family and relationships

Here are two questions about parents' relationships with adult children:? 1) Is it "healthy" to not discuss things with your adult parents that bother you about your relationship with them?  I mean, should you just act like there are no problems and give the performance of an Oscar - winning actor/actress to keep the peace?\n\n2) If it isn't unhealthy to pretend there are no problems, what is the best way act like nothing is wrong?  Can some people not pull this off because of their personality?  I can't seem to hide my feelings very well, and I need some tips.\n\nThis is a very serious question to me, and I appreciate all SERIOUS answers. If  you are just going to be a smart elec, please don't answer.  Thanks! Well let me start by saying that I could have written your questions. I have the same feelings as you that pertain to my parents and I am in my 40's. It is unhealthy to pretend that nothing is wrong and that your feelings dont matter, because they do!! The only advice that I can share with you is what I do myself. Since talking never gets you anywhere, stop wasting your breath....but start keeping your distance from your parents, It really will benefit you to not be around negative people and if you are questioned as to why you dont come around be honest with them and tell them exactly the reason why and until they are ready to listen to your concerns that this is the way it has to be. As for you , you might want to think about seeing a councelor to help you deal with the feelings that you have concerning your parents reactions about discussing problems. I hope one day your parents will open thier minds and listen to you but if they dont then you just have to accept the way they are and just do whats right for you, I dont suggest keeping your feelings to yourself, that only does harm to you. Good luck with this.	family and relationships

Someone just said "I LOVE U" today? I have known this man for almost 5 yrs now, i was in love with him since I met him and he tried to hide it cos he thought i was too young then, he was 31 and I was 21. When he told me what he feels I had to move to another country for my education. We kind of had a bad breakup then cos of things happenin then. He told me he wont marry anyone and that he will wait for me. I never belived that he would do such a thing. After almost 2 yrs I was in love with a guy and we were together for 2 yrs, I had a really really horrible breakup with this guy a few months ago. I have been speaking to the other guy very frequently since then and hes still not married and is waitin for me. Hes never even now rushed me for anything and we have started speaking about us and my ex has started to dwindle away slowly. This man has been very patient with me through all things even knowing about things about my breakup. Just today he said I love u ...and i guess i feel the same too but am scared to say it? well,\n\nwhy not give yourself a chance. i wouldnt say give him a chance, cos it appear to me that he is mature enough not to rush you. and he love you enough to do that. nothing is for sure in a relationship, but since he is so nice, worth a try. beside, age shouldnt be a barrier. good luck.	family and relationships

i love a boy but i'm not sure did he love me, how can i tell him?  One of the best ways to find out if someone truly loves you, is to think about if he or she is truly looking out for your best interest; nowadays, love is totally misinterpreted. Look at his actions and what he says and think, "Are those actions and words motivated by him looking out for me, or for his own interests."\nHope this helps, ....from a guy's point of view, by the way. As a guy, I know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain..	family and relationships

is he into me? i know everyone asks this..but i need help!? ok so there is this guy that is already pretty shy and i met him about 2 months ago. well, actually we used to kind of hang out when we were really little. now he is a pro racer and im a journalist and while i was at a race i had to interview him and since our families knew eachother him and i hung out for a little bit and stuff. his mom was talking to me while he was racing and saying how he is pretty shy and doesnt really pay attention to most girls because they arent into bikes but she thought it was cool because i race too. so since he lives in my town, we have kept in touch by myspace and calling eachother. we have been trying to go riding together- he came up with that idea he leaves me comments that are flirty with winking smileys. then i flirt to but when we are talking on the phone he seems like excited when i call him but he doesnt talk that much. his mom has called me a couple times to ask if i wanted to go watch her sons races and stuff. he flirts and everything..i dunno... He likes you. There is no doubt about this. He doesn't show off his feelings to you because he is shy and fear of the possibility of getting rejected by you.\n\nNow, you need to decide whether you wait for him or go after something else. I see a good prospect here because his mom called you to hang out. Its positive that his mother know his son's feeling toward you.\n\nI believe that a guy who rush into things will not lasts. Your shy guy maybe shy at first, but later when he sure of his feelings for you, he will give you the world if he can. In short, its up to you if he worth the wait or not.	family and relationships

There is a fine line between love and slavery and these men are acting like little bitches.  It is the most pathetic thing i have ever seen.  If these women arnt putting out then these men need to be whipped with a belt.  I say men and women should each give 50-50.  not 100-0.  I can see the future filled with little girly men and BLAH!!! Some men will do that but not all and it's do to the fact that if we don't do exactly what the women want they will probably leave or argue or something and to prevent that they will act like slaves.

difference when marrying a 23 year old girl in 30 year od woman? I am 23 year old but my boyfirend is 56 year old, he said that if i was only 30 plus of age surely he will marry me. i don't know what's the difference if am 30 plus year old or 23 year old He is trying to tell you that you are too young for him, and the age difference will interfere with your marriage in later years.\nI am 58 and I would not even think about marrying a lady under the age of 40.\nYou did not mention if he had any kids of your age or older.  I am sure there are several reasons that he knows better to marry someone of your age, and really I do not think that you would want to marry someone of that age either.\nYou may think that you love him, but do you love him for his money?\nGood Luck	family and relationships
Woman troubles  Was I in the wrong? My girlfirend accused me of lying.  I told her I did notknow what she was talking about. She said she knew there was something but not sure what.  Said she knew me well enough to know I was hiding something.  I sent her a text saying please do not text or phone cos I will delete the messages.  BUT I have this week spent time showing a girl (I had a brief fling with) and her boyfriend  round my country.  I told my ex nothing of this.  But did say I was doing nothing at the wekend  when she asked..... thats when I then sent her the text to get her off my back.  Did not want to tell her cos she would probably have made a fuss.  Anyway is a man allowed no secrets? Told her I had no idea whatshe was on about and to leave me alone.  Was I allwrong or is she wrong too....I think she is.....why could she not just believe me  and save all this fuss. There was really no need for this to escalate as it has.  You could have just told her you were going to be spending the week showing some old friends, who are a couple, round your country.  She has picked up that there is something wrong and now the two of you are at odds with each other.  Had you been upfront with her and told her what was going on, the ball would have been in her court as she would have had to trust you.  I think if you want still to be with her, you will need to explain to her that you were showing some old friends round (say they are a couple) and that you were not sure whether to tell her or not, since you used to date the female half of the couple, a long, LONG, time ago.  Even if you do think she was totally in the wrong, I think it would be politic for you to apologise nicely to her for not having trusted her to trust you.  I think it would be very difficult for her to answer that one without looking bad herself.	family and relationships
Which lady is up for this? My Idea of a romantic weekend\nA spur of the moment trip to a tropical Island with lots of sun and sandy beaches. A night of dancing and drinking thoes little tropical conctions with a unbrella in it. Then a night in bed at a cabana on a secluded beach. The windows and the french doors wide open overlooing the beach and ocean. Drapes fluttering and candels all around the room flickering from the ocean breeze. The sun going down on the horzion outside the door. While passionatly being made love to till the candels burn out. I think ALL ladies would be up for that.  It sounds almost perfect.

Suspicious? What if you think your spouse is not telling the truth and might be having an affair and when you ask you just don't believe them.. What do you do? I am told that not telling the truth is the most common attitude.\n\nit is a common reflex in order to protect the official relationship.\n\nDo you little research (pockets, mobile phone, emails etc), if that is important to you. You can also hire a private detective, but that is expensive. Otherwise, just probe some good friends naively and see what they say/ know.\n\nGood luck, it is not pleasant to suspect your partner is having an affair. On the other side, knowing the full truth is not necessarily better. I have been there.\n\nAll the best.	family and relationships

This is something I need help with ladies? I apologize, but this is sort of a long story, so please bear with me.\n\nI have known this lady for some time now, we recently about a couple months ago reallly started to hang out and talk more. Over the two month span I believe we gained interest in one another, but never have openly admitted it. Then two weeks ago, she approached me and told me that she liked me and that for right now we should stay friends and see how things progress. I was accused of being reserved, and rightfully so. I asked her out to the movies last week, and she said yes, so that was good. She then the other night, she called me because she was upset with something, so I listened and did my best to be genuine about it. In that same conversation, I told her that fear has made me reserved (due to a bad relationship in the past) and that I felt that the fear of us being more had subsided. I then told her I am ready when she is, so now she is thinking on it. There's more.... Don't let the past dictate your future.  If you can't tell someone how you feel then the relationship(whether friends or more than that) is not healthy.  If there are insecurities because of the past then you aren't being fair to this person, basing your feelings and insecurities on someone who came before gives no room to someone new.	family and relationships

feud with in laws? My husband and I just got married last year. Its my first marriage. Its his 2nd. His ex wife left him and 2 kids a few years ago. I helped raising and disiplines them. They're like my own kids. We have a new son now. Until recently, his ex wife shows up, my in laws mom& sisters came with her to my house. I felt so upset and hurt to see them on ex wife s side. I've always been nice to my in laws. They always get in our way such as bothering us to see the grandkids often. They need to understand that we just got married. I need some time to make adjustments on my new family. Help, advice please. Your husbands parents have some mental problems. Do not allow these losers in your home. They had no right to upset their grandkids like that. That woman walked out on them, she abandoned them, and now it seems shes back because she wants the unconditional love children have to offer. This makes me sick, your husband should tell his parents to go to hell and he should get a lawyer to keep this she demon away from the children.	family and relationships

I want some honest opinions from someone who has dated through the online dating websites. Is it reliable ?  i think its a good way to really get to know someone before you meet them in person. meeting potential dates in 'conventional' ways (bars/clubs etc)can sometimes be awkward - not being able to chat properly etc. internet dating gives you an easy way out aswell if you find you dont get on with that particular person! it also gives you a chance to meet people that you wouldnt normally meet. i have used dating sites myself for the first time this year & have made some great new friends, been on a couple of dates and have recently started seeing a guy i get on really well with. obviously you have to be careful of the many (!) strange people on the net, but there are loads of genuine, lovely people out there too. i even convinced a couple of my friends to give internet dating a go aswell, one is also now very happy with a new man! i say go for it, you have nothing to lose & at the very least only new friends to gain!! :D	family and relationships

What is your definition of a friend? I recently have had friends start rumors about me. These are people that I talk to on a daily basis, I hang out with and go to church with. And I was just wondering what your opinion of a friend was. Well starting a rumor is certainly not a very good sign of friendship. To me it means that you care about one another and will do all you can to be of help to each other. You would expect to be treated as you treat. Real friends are hard to come by, it seems all people do anymore is use people. I know of one person who says we are friends (but we aren't in my opinion) but all she wants is something from me or from all her other friends. Each friend has a specialty thing, one is a carpenter, another a photographer another a hairdresser and the list goes on. What does she do for them, nothing at all. That is not a friend that is a leech. Friends are someone you can count on no matter what the situation. They will be with you through tough times and fun times and their feelings will only change for the better. sorry that your friends are so shallow, but some day when they need a friend they will find no one to talk with..	family and relationships
How do i get people to take me more serious? I have a reputation of being a prankster, class clown, etc.. i just got out of college and i need some advice on how to get people take me seriously at my new job, where i know a few people who know about me. 1. You need to be able to get passed that people know you were a class clown. You'll never be able to become more serious if you're always afraid that they are going to tell people. \n2. Straighten up your act and get ready to take things more seriously and step up to the plate and grow up. You are going to be working now and actually needing this. School isn't something you really need as much as a job so time to buckle down and stay focused. \nShow everyone you're serious about this job and that you are mature and ready to take on the world... or just your cubicle.	family and relationships
Need Help, Ladies please answer? I live with a girl i have been with for just about three years now. For me the feelings just arn't there any more. I love her, but as a friend. AND JUST AS A FRIEND. She is the most sensitive girl in the world and takes everything the wrong way and cries over everything. This will break her heart and hurt her so bad. Especially since she lives there with me. How do i tell her i feel this way and think we should sepparate???? I think for most sensitive girls (I would say I am one) I think it is best done like a band-aid - really. A lot of the time we fake that we are sensitive and vulnerable so guys feel they can't leave us. Also, how do you know that she doesnt doubt the relationship as well. Above all - you need to tell her how you feel. I can guarentee that is the only way to go forward. And when you tell her, just say 'we need to talk about us' so she knows exactly what is coming.	family and relationships

I'm not going to give you the answers, because you can really work them out for yourself.\n\nYou need to work out the molecular weight, which is just the sum of the atomic weights in the appropriate proportions. Say that works out to be 100 for a particular molecule: that means that 100g of the substance contains 1 mole (6.022 x 10^23) molecules - so 1 gram contains one hundredth of that, or 6.022 x 10^21 molecules.\n\nApply that to each of the molecules in your questions, and you'll be home and dry.	science

Since diamonds are composed of almost pure carbon,would ash and water be a good way to clean the diamond??? Thanks for your info....Tom Science 4 First of all, ash isn't pure carbon.  It contains particulates of unburnt material, etc.  Secondly, it doesn't matter what the cleaning agent is made out of that counts.  Just because diamond is carbon, doesn't mean you have to clean it with carbon.  What you need to find out is whether or not a particular agent will dissolve whatever you have on the stone, plus not dissolve the stone itself.  Acetone, alcohol, or most other solvents will do this just fine.\n\nHope this helps.	science

do you think our IQ level is in our genes? I mean, say the first time you take an IQ test, and it is determined that you have an IQ of 102, does that mean that you were born with an IQ of 102, and that it's in your genes? Or does it depend on your life style, education...? Intellingence is thought to be influenced by many factors, genetics being but one of them.\n\nObviously, injury or disease can damage the brain, and result in lower intelligence, as can other factors such as malnutrition.\n\nAlso important are the conditions encountered during early childhood development.  The brain has certain "critical windows", when it is most open for developing language, reasoning, spatial relationships, and other skills.  Children who do not receive the proper stimulus during these windows find it difficult, if not impossible to learn the skills in later life.	science

The local anesthetic agent binds to certain receptors on the cell membrane and exert their action.The sequence of action are as follows:\n * Displacement of calcium ions from nerve receptor site..\n * Binding of local anesthetic molecule to this receptor site..\n * Blockade of sodium channel.\n * Decrease in sodium conduction.\n * Depression of rate of electrical depolarization.\n * Failure to achieve threshold potential level.\n * Lack of development of propagated action potential.\n * Conduction blockade.\n  \n   As for as the routes are concerned, LA can be given as:\n * topical application.\n * infiltration under the skin or mucous membrane to block peripheral nerves.\n * intramuscular to block a nerve, e.g. mandibular nerve   block for extraction of lower molars.\n * intrathecal ( into the spinal cavity), e.g.as in cesarean section.	science
how are foundations for bridges stuck on the river beds? I mean in the water, how is the concrete poured , if it's always wet There are many ways to do this. \n\n1. Engineers pour the concrete into metal forms, and remove the forms when the concrete dries.\n\n2. Another way is to temporarily divert the whole river through a side channel or tunnel, but I think this is usually done only when they want to build a dam across it.\n\n3. They can put a temporary barrier across a part of the river to build the foundations there, then build another temporary barrier across a different part of the river to build the next foundations, and so on till all the foundations are build.  \n\n4. Some rivers flow seasonally, so they just wait till it is not flowing to build the bridge.	science

What evidence suggsts that oxygen delivery to tissues has been compromised after total hip replacement?  To answer your question I really need to know more specifically what you are asking.\n \nDo you mean compromise acutely during the operation or chronically in the post-op setting? Do you mean compromise to all the tissues of the body or only those tissues at or distal to the operative site.\n\nIn general signs of inadequate oxygen (hypoxia) under anesthesia depend on the severity of the hypoxia. Lactic acidosis would be evident via blood gas analysis. As the hypoxia progressed changes in the EKG would begin to manifest ultimately leading to cardiac arrest. Signs of severe hypoxia that had occured in the operative setting include possible changes (temporary or permanent) to every organ system including:\n\nneuro:loss of mental capacity, seizures,blindness\nPulmonary: post hypoxic syndrome \nGI: bowel ischemia \nGU: renal failure, ATN\nHepatic: failure, elevated transaminases\nCardiac: EKG changes, muscle necrosis\n\nOngoing compromise of oxygen delivery in the post-op setting (in the absense of pulmonary disease) is of course a function of blood flow. The signs and symptoms of inadequate blood flow also depend on the severity of the same. If mild- delayed healing might manifest. If severe- changes in color, temperature, cap refill, and pulse volume would manifest as well as possible numbness or tingling distal to the site. \n\nThe problem is that most hip replacements occur in the senior population. The same population that may already have some level of cardiopulmonary impairment to begin with. Most noteably if they have COPD, or they smoke, or they are overweight, or have poor diets or genes that have left them with partially clogged blood vessels.	science
What is the function of the glottis?  The space between the vocal cords is called the glottis. As the vocal cords vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a "buzzing" quality to the speech, called voice or voicing.\n\nSounds production involving only the glottis is called glottal. English has a voiceless glottal fricative spelled "h". In many accents of English the glottal stop (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant allophone of the phoneme /t/ (and in some dialects, occasionally of /k/ and /p/); in some languages, this sound is a phoneme of its own.	science

What are the polarity differences that occur in a soap molecule?  Soap is polarized at one end, and non-polar at the other.\n\nYou know how water and oil don't mix?  That's because water is polar and oil is non-polar.  As a rule, "Like dissolves like."  So polar things dissolve in water, non polar things dissolve in oil.  We call polar things "hydrophilic" ("water-loving"), while non-polar things can be called either hydrophobic ("water-fearing") or lipophilic ("oil-loving").  Since oil and water don't dissolve well in one another, they tend to separate from eachother.\n\nSoap is special because it is hydrophilic at one end and hydrophobic at the other.  This makes it act as a bridge between the two.  Oil gets washed away with soap because the soap molecule will orient itself around little droplets of oil with the hydrophobic end in the oil, leaving the hydrophilic end facing the water.  This allows the water to carry away the small droplets of oil packaged in a coat of soap, and hence cleans you by removing things not normally soluble in water.	science

Partial Pressure and mass? In a mixture of   Ne   and   H2   gases, the partial pressure of   Ne   is   0.180 atm.   The total pressure is   0.410 atm.   The temperature is   28.0oC.   If the total volume of the gas mixture is   421 mL,   what is the mass of   H2   in grams? The partial pressure of H2 is just the total pressure minus the partial pressure of Ne.  The ratio of the H2 part press and total press gives the mole fraction of H2.  \n\nNow just calculate the number of moles in your 421 mL using the ideal gas equation  PV = nRT.  Solve for n, multiply this by the mole fraction of H2 to get the moles of H2, then multiply this by the mole weight of H2.\n\nI'll let you do the math.	science
Mass percent using two algebraic equations? A sample of a mixture containing only sodium chloride and potassium chloride has a mass of 6.4100g. When this sample is dissolved in water and excess silver nitrate is added, a white precipitate (silver chloride) forms. After filtration and drying, this precipitate has the mass 12.7559g.\nWhat is the mass percentage of sodium chloride in the mixture? Your two basic algebraic equations are:\nmoles Na + moles K = moles Cl \n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (g Cl-) = 6.4100 g\n\nThe mass of the final precipitate means that there are 7.50921 x 10-2 mol of chloride ions present in the initial mixture.\nSee:\nmol Cl = mol AgCl = g AgCl/MW AgCl = 12.7559/169.87 = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nThe mass of the chloride component of the starting materials is then determined by:\n\ng Cl = MW Cl x mol Cl = (7.50921 x 10-2 mol) x (35.45 g/mol) = 2.662 g\n\nPlug that back into the second eqn and you get:\n\n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (2.662 g) = 6.4100 g\nor\n(g Na+) + (g K+) = 3.748 g\n\nConvert back to moles and plug that into the first equation and you get:\n\nmoles Na + moles K = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\nmoles Na + ((g K+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\n((g Na+) / (22.99 g/mol)) + ((3.748 - g Na+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nAnd now solve for g Na + \n\nDivide that by 3.748 g and you're there!	science

Who loves science? Okay, I have a science question.  Why do frogs have so many more eggs than chickens? Like the above person said, the more eggs you spit out, the more likely there is of some of them surviving to adulthood. It also depends on the development of the species. Chickens are relatively developed in comparison to frogs (tadpoles) when hatched, so more energy is put into each egg and ensuring its survival (the hen incubates the egg). Most frogs however, lay a mass of eggs and leave them to their own defences. \nTry and compare some animals that lay eggs and the state of development of the offspring and that gives you a pretty good understanding.	science

What effect do u think this has on the bird populations of the local ecosystem? Read this first! Some people place bird feeders in their yards. "It's safe to say that feeders are more important to the people who maintain them than to the birds that use them. For people, bird feeders are a great way to connect with nature and enjoy close-up views of some of nature's most colorful and agile creatures. For birds, feeders merely supplement their normal intake of food. Even birds that regularly visit feeders obtain only a small percentage of their overall diet from them. However, research on black-capped chickadees has shown that chances of surviving a harsh winter may be greater for birds that have access to feeders. It's likely that this is true for other birds as well."	science

what is meant by corriolis principle?  Christina is wrong. When you drop something, it is already rotating along with the earth, and continues to do so as it falls, for there is nothing to stop it.\n\nIn fact, the real Coriolis effect DEPENDS on the fact that an object dropped, or thrown, or shot out of a gun, is rotating along with the earth. Consider this. A spot on the equator is rotating eastward at about 1,000 miles per hour. Places north of that are rotating eastward slower than that. Places near the north pole are rotating eastward very slowly. A circle around the north pole having a circumfrence of 24 miles is rotating eastward at 1 mile per hour.\n\nIf you position a gun on the equator, the bullet contained therein is travelling eastward at 1,000 miles per hour, along with the gun. If you shoot the gun northward, the bullet wlil travel over land that is travelling eastward slower than 1,000 miles per hour. The bullet, however, will continue to travel eastward at 1,000 miles per hour because there is nothing to stop it. The bullet will appear to have an eastward force applied, but there is no such force.	science

2 percent incline after one mile?  Not sure what you're asking here - 2% incline means that the height you go up is 2% of the horizontal distance (not the slope distance) travelled.\n\nSo 2% will mean for every 100m horizontal you travel - you will go up 2m.\n\nSo are you saying you have travelled 1 mile horizontally - in which case you will move up 0.02 miles (or using pythagoras' theorem you could get the actual slope distance travelled dÂ² = 1Â² + 0.02Â², which gives 1.0002 miles)\n\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile vertically - in which case you will have moved 50 miles horizontally (since there are 50 2%'s in 100%) (or do you want the actual slope distance travelled, dÂ² = 1Â² + 50Â², which gives 50.01 miles)\n\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile up a 2% slope.  In which case we need to use pythagoras' theorem backwards to get the horizontal and vertical parts.  The horizontal we can call x and the vertical is 2% of this, ie 0.02x.\n\nSo we get:  1Â² = xÂ² + (0.02x)Â²\n\n1 = xÂ² + 0.0004xÂ²\n1 = 1.0004xÂ²\nxÂ² = 1/1.0004 - 0.99960\nx = 0.9998\n\nSo we will have travelled 0.998 miles horizontally and 2% of this (which is 0.019996 miles) vertically.	science

Explain the actions of the physiological buffer system? (details below)? there are 3 physiological buffer systems:\n\n1. the bicarbonate buffer system\n2. the phosphate buffer system\n3. the protein buffer system All of them stabilize pH (concentration of H+).\n\n1. Carbonic acid (weak acid) dissociates partly bothsides:\nH2O + CO2 <=> H2CO3 <=> HCO3-, H+. Whatever you add, the equilibrium of this reaction shifts to one or another direction and H+ concentration of the solution (acidity) remains the same.\n\na) If you add acid ( more H+ then), a disbalance occurs. Excessive H+ react with HCO3- and a larger quantity of H2CO3 is formed. And it dissociates to water and CO2, neutralising addition of some acid.\n\nb) When a base is added, a part of H+ is removed (H+ and OH- form water, which is neutral). Then also a disbalance occurs, which causes CO2 combination with water, formation of H2CO3 and appearance of new H+. \n \n2. Na2HPO4 <=> 2Na+ + HPO4/2- + H+ <=>  H2PO4-  \nAnalogically, a shift occurs when adding acid or base, neutralising their effect:\na) HCl + Na2HPO4 => NaH2PO4 + NaCl \nb) NaOH + NaH2PO4 --> Na2HPO4 + H2O \n\n3. Different proteins act as buffers. Hemoglobin (located in red blood cells) buffer is one of strongest. Imidazole groups of histidine residues of this protein are most significant for this effect.\n\nHemoglobin without O2 <=> reduced hemoglobin \nReduced hemoglobin takes on H+, decreasing amount of free H+ in solution and the solution becomes not so acid.	science

In the northern hemisphere this is on 21 or 22 December, in the southern hemisphere it's on 21 or 22 June.\n\nThe summer solstice is the day when the days are the longest (on 21 or 22 June in the northern hemisphere and 21 or 22 December in the southern).\n\nSo, on the solstices the length of the day and the altitude of the sun (at noon) are the maximum or the minimum compared to all the other days of the year.\n\nAn equinox is when the sun passes over the equator, which happens twice every year, around March 21 and September 23.  On those two days the night and the day have equal length on every location in the world.	science

Did Descartes really said that Pascal has too much vacuum in his head?  Yes.\n\nSince 1646 Pascal began a series of experiments on atmospheric pressure. By 1647 he had proved to his satisfaction that a vacuum existed. Descartes visited Pascal on 23 September. His visit only lasted two days and the two argued about the vacuum which Descartes did not believe in. Descartes wrote, rather cruelly, in a letter to Huygens after this visit that Pascal had too much vacuum in his head.\n\nIn August of 1648 Pascal observed that the pressure of the atmosphere decreases with height and deduced that a vacuum existed above the atmosphere. Descartes wrote to Carcavi in June 1647 about Pascal's experiments saying: "It was I who two years ago advised him to do it, for although I have not performed it myself, I did not doubt of its succes"\n\nIn October 1647 Pascal wrote New Experiments Concerning Vacuums which led to disputes with a number of scientists who, like Descartes, did not believe in a vacuum.\n\nRene Descartes (1596-1650) \nBlaise Pascal (1623-1662)	science

After whom is Mount Everest named and why?  The mountain was given its English name by Andrew Waugh, the British surveyor-general of India. With both Nepal and Tibet closed to foreign travel, he wrote:\n\nâ¦I was taught by my respected chief and predecessor, Colonel Sir Geo. Everest to assign to every geographical object its true local or native appellation. â¦ But here is a mountain, most probably the highest in the world, without any local name that we can discover, whose native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal.â¦ In the meantime the privilege as well as the duty devolves on me to assignâ¦a name whereby it may be known among citizens and geographers and become a household word among civilized nations.\n\nHence Waugh chose to name the mountain after George Everest, first using the spelling Mont Everest, and then Mount Everest.	science

Using conceptual physics to support religon? My beliefs are pretty much a mix of methodism/deism/quantum physics, and i believe that your perception of the world, its gods, and your ideas about the afterlife and the state of the universe will determine what you percieve as your afterlife.  In quantum physics, time does not exist.  Also, in order to exist, something must be observed.  As time does not exist, and the perception of time is simply our minds viewing the different probabilities the world may exist in.  Therefore, all people are both alive and dead.  In order to observe ourselves and observe others, we must exist.  As something cannot both exist and not exist, only change form or be transfered between dimensions, the sentience that inhabits our bodies must persist after death for us to observe our lives, as both life and death occur simultaniously according to this worldview.  \n\nTherefore, there must be something beyond death.\n\nYour thoughts? Nice ideas, but do they keep you up at night? I prefere to think of life as something that may not last, so I go ahead and enjoy it as much as possible. If there is an afterlife, yippee. If not, then I've spent the time I had well. I sleep well at night.	science

link to the electronic circuit design for control of oscillations in real life phenomena? can neone provide a link to a circuit which controls oscillations of a pendulum or an oscillator in real life?for example in a mechanical swing. Not to a pendulum but to control oscillations in a circuit sense, on ecould use a phase lock loop (pll).  Its whole life revolves around using a reference oscillator, locking onto it and outputting a new oscillation of frequency f or some multiplier of f.\nThe major components are as follows\n1) Phase Detector:  It determines if you are locked or not\n2) Charge pump: Produces an up or down control signal depending on the output of the Phase Detector to either speed up or down f\n3)Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO):  Takes the up/down control signal from the Charge Pump and produces a new f that is either faster or slower.  This is the output of your new oscillator.\n4)Feedback loop: Taken from the VCO, it is compared with the reference oscillator you started with and determines if the two are locked.  If they are, you have a locked pll and can know that the output from the VCO is a good clean clock.\n\nThis is a reeeeaaaallll basic overview.  Some pll designer will probably come in and correct me!	science

If God exist do UFO's also exist? Does God manage more than one property? Explain why or why not. Over the centuries in many cultures there have often been sightings, drawings and abductions. What do you think? Is there a connection? If God is a construct of how mankind views a supreme existence, and UFO's are a construct of how we percieve the existence of life outside the boundaries of the known realm which we know life exists; then why wouldn't they both exist simultaneously.\n  You're correct that there have been many depictions in a variety of cultures throughout man's recorded presence upon Earth, but what man calls God, has also had a multitude of names and faces.\n\n If God exists, and he created mankind, and mankind has created the machines which we use daily to travel across our planet, to the moon, and beyond. It seems to be that  other beings which God, or perhaps another God that 'manages other property' would also create machines which would accomplish similar tasks.\n\nMaybe the Universe itself is God, and we are just a singular cell of a mighty living organism.	science

what is the mythological significance of the constellation bootes?  "One legend says the Bootes, whose name comes from the Greek word for "ox-driver" or "herdsman", was the son of Demeter (Roman: Ceres), the goddess of agriculture. The constellation of Bootes was once also know as Arcturus. Bootes is credited with inventing the plow and was placed in the sky to honor his invention, of such immense importance to civilization.\nIn another myth, Bootes was the son of Zeus and Callisto. Callisto, transformed into a bear by Zeusâs jealous wife, Hera, was in danger if being killed by her son Bootes, who was out hunting, until she was rescued by Zeus, who took her into the heavens. There Callisto became the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear."	science

When viewed from the Southern Hemisphere, is the Moon upside down? I look up at the Moon from my home in Scotland and see it as it has always looked to people here, in the Northern Hemisphere. But if I was in the Southern Hemisphere and looked at the Moon, would it look the same, or Upside Down.\nI guess the same question could be asked in reverse by someone "Down Under" :-D As the moon is round, I think even if it is upside down, we won't notice it. Because a circle remains a circle whether looked from up, down, right or left.\nAlso the moon is completely white. If it was different colours we would have known whether it was upside down .ie. by looking at the colour's position.\n\nIt is a very puzzling question! I answered what I think.

how do you split water? science project Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction or process in which a molecule is split into two parts by reacting with a molecule of water, which has the chemical formula H2O. One of the parts gets an OH from the water molecule and the other part gets an H from the water.\n\nWhen performed using electric current, the process is called electrolysis\n\nOne important use of electrolysis is to produce hydrogen. The reaction that occurs is\n\n    2H2O(aq) â 2H2(g) + O2(g)\n\nIn the future, this could play a central role in shifting our society over to a reliance on hydrogen as an energy carrier for powering electric motors and internal combustion engines. (See hydrogen economy.) Electrolysis of water can be achieved in a simple hands-on project, where electricity from a battery or low voltage DC power supply (eg computer power supply 5v rail) is run into a cup of water (in practice a saltwater solution or other electrolyte will need to be used otherwise no result will be observed). Using platinum electrodes, hydrogen gas will be seen to bubble up at the cathode, and oxygen will bubble at the anode. Using any other electrode for the anode however, the oxygen will react with the anode instead of being released as a gas. For example using iron electrodes in a sodium chloride solution electrolyte, iron oxide will be produced at the anode, which will react to form iron hydroxide. When producing large quantites of hydrogen, this can significantly gunge up the electrolytic cell - which is why iron is not used for commercial electrolysis.\n\nThe energy efficiency of water electrolysis varies widely. Some report 50â70%, while others report 80â94%. These values only refer to the efficiency of converting electrical energy into hydrogen's chemical energy. The energy lost in generating the electricity is not included. For instance, when considering a power plant that converts the heat of nuclear reactions into hydrogen via electrolysis, the total efficiency is more like 25â40%.	science

Among the variety of humans, are there any different species? If another meaning for race is actually "sub-species", then does that mean that there are many kinds of homo sapiens sapiens? No.  We're all Homo sapien sapiens. (and no, that's not a typo)\n\n>>>what would stop the republicans from trying to put it on the \n>>>endangered species list\n\nI expect the members of that species would.  Why just republicans?  Just wondering since they tend not to be so big on environmental issues...\n\n____________\nCarter, FYI the biological species concept definition of a species (the one you attempted to apply to humans) isn't actually used anywhere outside of a high school classroom.  Lions and tigers and interbreed (and produce fertile offspring), as can wolves and cyotes.  However, I don't think anyone would argue that lions and tigers are the same species.  You've arrived at the correct conclusion, but for the wrong reasons.\n\nOh, and Homo sapien is two words, although the proper name for modern humans is actually Homo sapien sapien.\n\n_________\n>>>"put it on the endangered species list" as in, genocide, \n\nWhat???  That doesn't make sense.  The endangered species list is a list of species we're protecting, not species we're trying to eliminate.  Putting a species on the endangered species list make it illegal to kill members of that species under most circumstances.\n\nTo answer you question about genocide, however, what stops genocide now?  I don't see where it would be any different if we were talking about a group that is officially a separate species.  Although, species being driven to extinction or "exterminated" is usually look upon as a *bad* thing, so I don't see where their being a separate species is an inherent justification for genocide, although I think it would be human nature to use it as such.\n\n\n_______\nThanks for pointing that out, Calimecita, I went back and capitalized the genus names.

Biology or Zoology Degree? I'm going to start school soon and plan on studying Biology. I love animals and absolutely think they are very interesting to learn about. Now my question is should I continue on recieving my bachelors in Biology or Zoology? I know a BA in Zoology isn't very useful when trying to get jobs as apposed to BA in Biology. But I certainly think I'd be more interested in Zoology. Any Zoologist out there have adivce for me? Also what jobs have you gotten with either degree? zori there isn't really any difference between the two. Some universities have only a biology department, while some will have the disciplines divided up into zoology, botany, micro, etc. And now there are molecular biology departments. What matters is the courses you take, and that will depend on what you are interested in. Being in a zoology department - or in a program where that is the department that will grant your degree shouldn't preclude you from taking courses in botany and micro, etc. In fact they may well insist on it. I have an undergraduate degree from a biology department, a master's from a bio department and a PhD from a zoology department. I studied whatever I wanted, didn't think about what the degree was going to say and nobody else did. When looking for a job, your coursework and experience will do the talking not the department or degree name.\n\nGood luck - good to have another biologist/zoologist joining the team!	science

reservation is proffessional institutions brings social eqality? debate on it by giving points on both for and against Yeah....it makes everyone equally poor and makes life equally suck for everyone.\n\nThe bottom line is this, it is good for society that the more able, intelligent and valuable members be given certain important jobs and have greater access to resources.  Those with lesser skill and ability or whom are of low value, are that way by choice.  Giving them positions of authority or giving them greater access to resources is highly damaging.  This also has little to do with race or race relations or anything.  It is solely a function of choice.  And being a function of choice, not only is it highly inappropriate to give lesser people preference over better people, based on race, it is disasterous to do so.\n\nFurther, it is highly counter-productive to have preferences with regard to social equality.  What you are doing is removing the incentive for these people to choose to be equal.  That is very, very bad for them.  Not only will most members of the preferred group see no point in improving themselves, the situation tends to favor those who show up for a situation first, rather than those who actually improve themselves.  That college that lets in unqualified black students, is, in effect, giving those slots on a first come, first serve basis, shutting out the QUALIFIED black students that come later.  It becomes pointless to work to become qualified.  And then the reputation, standards and quality of that college disintergrate.\n\nThis isn't social theory, btw.  It is the repeating pattern that has ALWAYS happened every time preferences are instituted.  It has been tried many, many times and there have been no exceptions.  Every single instance has resulted in dramatic failure.\n\nPreference based on merit is the ONLY workable solution.  Ironically, it is the ONLY path to social equality.\n\nRacial preferences are racist.  And racism hurts.	education and reference

If you think about your personally using a mass transit system, you have to think about your total experience and the point of view of the transit system. For a subway system, one usually goes into a subway where there is usually some booth there selling subway tokens or subway passes. You pay real money and get the subway tokens. You pay with these subway tokens to actually get onto the subway and then you need to look at a map to see where you are and where you need to get to. You go to the correct train and wait for it to show up. Once it does, you get on. You ride to your destination with no delays, then you get off and get out of that subway station and go your merry way. Now, that we've gone through the subway experience, you need to identify the "players" in your experience with the system. The players are you, money, subway tokens, map, train, train schedule, train on-time arrival. Inputs can be you (or people using subway) and real money, because thats where everything starts. An Output could be arriving at your correct destination on-time. Do you have the idea? I'll let you get back to your HW.	education and reference

any information about brihadeeshwar temple? 1.made by whom?\n2.environment present there?\n3.basic plan of construction?\netc. The Brihadisvara temple was built by the great Tamil ruler, Rajaraja Chola I of the Chola dynasty. The shikaram, an octagonal, carved cupola, itself is very large and heavy and, until recently, was thought to be carved out of a single stone. However during one of the cleaning efforts, it was found to be in two pieces. The task of carrying this huge crown to a height of 70 meters is another feat worth mentioning. In order to do this, an inclined plane of sand was built from a distance of nearly 11 kilometers. The place where this scaffold began is called the Sarap pallam.	education and reference

How can I become a translator? I will have a degree in English (BA) in July 2008, I am fluent in Greek and English\nwhat qualifications do i need? It just depends... in the past, all that was needed was bi-lingualism, and a bit of luck to be in the right place at the right time. In the modern day, some regulation is being brought to the art... I think Bath runs an MA in translation that's supposed to be really good, I've just finished Newcastle university's MA in translation studies... there are professional associations as well, from memory I think the ILT is the British one, the Institute of Linguists and Translators- I think they have their own tests. To do free-lance work, you don't need any of this- http://www.translatorsbase.com is one example of a website which you pay a registration fee for, and then you can bid on projects that conform to your speciality. \n\nI think free-lance can be a bit rough though- from what I've read, to make a living from it, you need to be working in a disciplined manner throughout the week, translating thousands of words a day, and your income is based upon how much you can put out- maybe you're talented enough for that, I don't know... I mean, talent and language ability is a big part of translation, but you can learn a lot about theory as well, either on a course, or through your own research. I'm aiming for an in-house post, I mean, in some company where senior staff will be able to offer guidance and advice, and I think the MA's going to be a boon in that...\n\nI think there are quite a few options available in post-graduate courses, and possibly shorter courses offered by other institutions as well.  I'd encourage you to think about it. For one thing, you can learn tips about the trade that you may not think of if you start freelance straight off, and have  your work looked at by people with experience at the kind of jobs you're aiming for on a weekly basis. Secondly, it raises the bar. Compared to other professions, there is a feeling that translation and interpreting is not fully fledged as yet, and income is relatively lower. Of course, I'm a bit biased having just come off the course, but I think it's helped a lot. Being in groups with other translation students is pretty helpful, you can learn from other people's style, everyone benefits.	education and reference

what type of dances were around in England during the renaissance?  In England and France, the early 1500's brought the rise of the pavane. In the 1580's, Arbeau's Orchesographie cites the decline of the basse dance and pavane and describes those dances as well as the alman (almain, allemande), the branle (in many variations), the galliard and tordion, the canarie (the Spanish Canario), and the lavolta. A number of Arbeau's branles are dances from masques which evolved into social dances; others which remain more performance than social include the morisque (Morris) and bouffons. \n\nAlso beginning in the late 16th century and continuing into the late 17th century, several English manuscripts often associated with the Inns of Court describe a number of pavanes and almans as part of the sequence of eight dances collectively known as the "Old Measures", as well as galliards and a number of other dances.	education and reference

Shakespeare's greatest plays were performed first in ___? a. the court\nb. courtyards of inns\nc. churches\nd. the Globe theatre The Globe Theatre was not built until 1599, when most scholars agree that he had already completed about 20 of his 38-or-so plays.  There are instances of Shakespeare's plays being performed in at least two of "The Inns of Court", which are four law schools in London: The Comedy of Errors in 1594, and Twelfth Night in 1602.\n\nHe was a stock-holder and an actor in the Lord Chamberlain's Men from 1594-on (the theatre was closed from 1592-1594 due to an outbreak of the plague), with performances before her majesty Queen Elizabeth I.  This is from the-quill.com: "During the years Shakespeare performed with the Chamberlain's Men, before their purchase of the Globe in 1599, they played primarily at the well-established theatres like the Swan, the Curtain, and the Theatre. The troupe would also give regular performances before Elizabeth I and her court, and tour the surrounding areas of London."\n\nSo I suppose the answer to the question should be a).  It appears that Shakespeare did quite a bit of writing and performing before the Globe Theatre was even built.  \n\nGood luck!	education and reference

Can you name the different types of amphibians?  Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all tetrapods that are not amniotes. Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the Lissamphibia. Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.\n\nThere are two ancient, extinct, subclasses:\n\nSubclass Labyrinthodontia (paraphyletic) \nSubclass Lepospondyli \nOf the remaining modern subclass Lissamphibia there are three orders:\n\nOrder Anura (frogs and toads) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species \nOrder Caudata or Urodela (salamanders): 552 species \nOrder Gymnophiona or Apoda (caecilians): 171 species \nAuthorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single Triassic proto-frog species, Triadobatrachus massinoti. Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.	education and reference

Although his fingers weren't like "dripping" with his semen or anything, I'm worried MAYBE there might have been *some* of it on him. He also never went inside of me, he was just rubbing "down there"\n\nWell, I got my full period three days later (on Sept. 15) and got my period again on (although it was late like 2-3 days) October 16th. Usually, I spot around ovulation, but this month I didn't. My breasts hurt a lot and stuff, and have been hurting since when I should have ovulated (Oct. 31st) I should have my period next week some time, if everything is "normal"\n\nThe question is, is there any way that I could still be pregnant? I am SO worried, I think maybe the guilt is getting to my head. I understand I am not ready for this stuff. Any help is appreciated. I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant! Just to be on the safe side, if I were you I'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period (or a week after you do). Good luck and try not to be such a nervous wreck, enjoy yourself!	health
If I start taking birth control and I don't know I am pregnant will I have a period.?  if you are not pregnant, then you will get your period. if you are pregnant, this is bad. this can cause birth defects in the baby, because this is just "birth control" pills... this is not "abortion pills"\nand if you are pregnant, please don't use the latter option... take good care of yourself... don't take any medications, don't drink, don't smoke. if you don't want a child, give it up for adoption. give the baby a chance to choose his/her life.\n\ntrivia: 2 weeks after conception, there is a heartbeat in a 2-week-old fetus. if people respect trees and animals so much, why not respect a fetus with a heartbeat?	health

How can I lose alot of weight in 4 weeks? My cousin is getting married in 4 1/2 weeks. I need to lose weight fast to fit in my dress. Since my mom is a nurse I can only go to the gym a couple of times a week if that,and I can only stay one hour before they kick us out.So can anyone give me some advice? Buy a skipping rope.  Skip for a couple of minutes, several times during the day, you can do it rain or shine.  Dogs won't chase you down the street.  You won't trip on ice, stones etc.  It is not expensive.  It gets your heart rate going faster than tread mill and takes up less space when you put it away.

Is it normal to not to masturbate? I'm 16 right now and I have stop masturbating for 2 years. I feel too sinful whenever i used to do it. I seeked professional help and a doctor told me I should masturbate. But I feel that it is still a very wrong thing to do. Now i'm getting erections at different times of the day, even when there are no sexsual arousements or what so ever. I know that everyone does it. But I still can't do it. Please,I need some helpful comments. Masturbation Frequency:\nhttp://www.jackinworld.com/misc/faqtree1.html#mastfreq\n\nHow often does the average male masturbate?\nIt depends on a lot of factors, the most important being age. For an 18-year-old male, a rough average is once a day or so. This is slightly higher for younger teenagers â maybe 10 or 12 times a week, and slightly lower for older people. You might be surprised by how often adult men masturbate â even happily married men.\n\nI think I'm addicted to masturbation. Is that possible?\nIt is, although many, many people think they're addicted when they're really just doing what comes naturally. For more on this topic, read the article Is Masturbation Addictive?(http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/addict.html).\n\nHow can I masturbate less often, or quit altogether?\nIt's tough; it takes a lot of will power. It can be done, especially if you're driven by very strong religious feelings. However, JackinWorld's position is that it's not worth it. We think you should enjoy the harmless pleasures your body can provide.\n\n\n\n\nConnection between ejaculation frequency and prostate health \nhttp://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/4961.html\n\nQUESTION:\nI have been coming across articles on the connection between masturbation, ejaculation, and overall health. I was very surprised about this article from the Cancer Council Victoria in Australia . It was a study that confirmed that ejaculation frequency is important for a healthy prostate. The protective effect was most significant in men in their twenties who ejaculated on average 7 or more times per week. It compared this against same-age men who ejaculated less than 3 times per week. I made a New Year's resolution to pay attention to my body and to ejaculate at least once a day. I feel much better for it and my penis strength and sexual urge has increased immensely. I feel balanced. After a year, I can't imagine going back to my old repressed frequency and probably couldn?t keep from cumming for a whole day if I tried now. Why aren?t people made aware of this need? After getting used to daily +, I often have the urge to do it even more, but hold back. Are there any physical problems with over ejaculating? \n\nANSWER:\nWhat a fabulous New Yearâs resolution to pay attention to your body!  Your efforts are worth applauding, as being in tune with yourself and your new masturbation schedule seems to have paid off, as you note that you feel âbalancedâ and âmuch better for it.â  Happily, no physical problems are associated with over-ejaculating, so donât worry about giving in to the natural urge to enjoy and pleasure yourself more often.  You clearly have a strong awareness of the positive effects of masturbation on your body, so go ahead and experiment with masturbation frequency â in this way, you can determine what frequency feels best for you and your regular routine.\n\nYou also ask why people arenât made aware of the âneedâ to masturbate often.  Good question â especially in light of the studyâs findings that frequent ejaculation helps reduce the risk of prostate cancer.  Unfortunately, self-stimulation â as with most sexual acts â is often viewed as shameful, dirty, immoral, and all sorts of other negative adjectives.  Wouldnât it be great if masturbation could be seen as the healthy, enjoyable, and beneficial activity it really is, openly talked about and (gasp!) endorsed?  Perhaps one day it will be â with more people like you who are open-minded and bold enough to talk about it in a positive light.  \n\nEnjoy â and pass that article along to friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, and anybody and everybody else!	health

is it true introverts are prone to neuroses when compared to extroverts?  I guess you need to be careful when learning about the introverts. And I find this question is a bit offensive, because you measure us from an extrovert point of view.\n\nYou must know, that most of the psychological criteria just list the condition of certain mental illnesses or disorders. There are no clear words or lines in the DMS-IV-TR, says that we introverts are prone to suffer from Neurosis.\n\nI believe there are many different reasons behind for people to suffer depression, anxiety, low sense of self-worth, and so on. Having such conditions, doesn't really mean that a person suffering from Neurosis.\n\nWhy we introverts have similar conditions? Is just simply from excessive loneliness that we experiencing, which cause by incapable of making and keeping friends.	health
what is the best way to work out your inner thighz?  Do a variety of hip adduction exercises (movements that bring your leg sideways across your body). You can do this by squeezing a stability ball between your legs. You can use a multi-hip machine or hip adduction machine at the gym. You can also use a resistance band; connect one end securely around an object, such as the leg of a bed. Connect the other end around your ankle. Stand with your side to the place where the resistance band is connected and with the ankle that has the resistance closer to the wall (other foot out). Stand far enough from the wall so that there is some resistance to moving your foot. Now slowly bring your foot with the resistance band forward and across in front of your other leg (so your legs are crossed) and bring it back to regular standing position. Use the wall/bed/furniture for balance.	health

On Birth Control Pill and skipped a period? OK, I have been on Birth Control (Ortho Tricylen Lo) for 2 months now. This month, I have not gotten my period yet. I have taken the pill around the same time (4:00) daily, give or take 2 or 3 hours depending on my schedual that day.  My boyfriend uses the withdraw method, and has only 'come' in me once, consequently, it was right after my last period and on the day I started my new pack.  Now, I am not on my period, but have no other pregnancy signs, and I have a slight brown discharge, and feel as though I am going to get my period ... Could I be pregnant? Or, is this just a side affect of being on birth control for the first time? That is a very common reaction to birth control. I wouldn't worry too much unless you really think you are pregnant. Of course it's always best to be cautious; for $10 a pregnancy test wouldn't hurt.	health

Do you feel......? Hi friends,\n\n       I have a strange...(mmm what to say..?)...ok. ...I have a strange characteristic.....I can sense what is gonna happen in the future beforehand......for eg.....If something bad is gonna happen I can feel it in my mind, it makes me cry suddenly without any reason and something bad happens the very day...n' if something good is gonna happen I feel that too and it happens,,,,is it strange..should I consult any psycologist? Do any one of you feel like me....help me. Before I start, I want to give you the link for a support group so you have a solid place to hear others opinions and ask anything you want about the problem you have. Here is the link: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/psychic-ability/\n\nThere are 2 more sites for you. I am not psychic nor would I ever claim to be. I am not some weirdo who is into whitchcraft either. I am a 37 year old wife and stay-at-home mother of 3. I am however, a strong believer in the fact that some people just have abilities that I do not. I have watched, read, looked into this psychic thing. I also believe that for the most part, the psychic abilities can be "channeled" in a positive way. I have often read of people who have abilities as you said you do, learn how to turn that entire situation into good. You can learn to expand on the bad feelings you get and possibly get to a point where it doesn't just make you cry, you are able to see exactly what bad thing is going to happen and possibly stop it from happening. I see the psychic's all the time where they are called in by the police department to try and find missing people, solve crimes, many times solve murders. The psychic has to experience the pain that the murder victim went through but I don't know about you but I would do it every day of the week if I could help a family find their loved one, help solve a murder, help put a murderer or rapest behind bars so they can't hurt anyone else. Don't look at this as an all bad thing. I wish I had the ability because my main goal would be to help law enforcement as much as I could no matter how muh it hurt to do it. Look what the rewards would be...you could help keep a community safe and end the hell that a family of a victim had been in. I do have to also say BE CAREFUL THOUGH.... You can develop this so it's a good thing. There are scams all over though. Psychic's and people and web sites that claim to be able to "help" you develop your abilities are one of the highest scams out there. Read..READ...READ...I can't tell you what to do, I can only tell you what I would do. I would get books on the subject from my local library 1st. I would do all sorts of reading online but DO NOT PLEASE give anyone even a red cent online. Even on the sites I am sending you below...the second someone asks for any type of money be it membership fees, buy my book, donations for others who are also trying to sharpen their skills, or fees for them to teach you. After I read non-stop on the internet and from my library, I personally would look for free introductory or free session of any type in my local area (internet is a good place to find out about them). Then I would be looking to my local community college and take classes, as many classes as I could on the subject. That way, you are getting the knowledge at the rate YOU are comfortable with, if anything makes you uncomfortable at any time, you can just stop right in your tracks. Lastly, NOBODY IS RIPPING YOU OFF. It sounds to me as if you possibly could have abilities, you can direct them to where you want them, and not have such a negative effect coming from this but watch your back. For someone people, money is all that matters. They will claim they are wanted to help and teach but in reality, they have their hand in your pocket. I wish you the world of luck. I can be contacted via email by, I think just clicking on my log in name on yahoo ask /answer if you would like to. This is a subject that I have studied/read about for a few years now. If you have any questions that I can answer, feel free.	health

It doesn't hurt anything and does not indicate some sort of sleep disorder.  It is not a habit that can be overcome, it is your body's natural function to keep the mouth moist.  If you can find a way to keep your mouth closed while sleepng, you won't drool.	health

Would you confront someone you know has a disease and think they already know but aren't telling? I have a cousin who (from all I've learned) has cervical dystonia.  She has repetitive head movements and also the fingers on one hand stay contracted most of the time.  Her son has been diagnosed with the disease but it involves one leg only.  He's been treated with it for about 10 years.  Everyone knows he has it.  The mother who shows symptoms of cervical dystonia has never admitted she has it also.  (It would mean the son got it from her genes and that evidently is not wanted)\n\nKnowing she has it, should I confront her with it and urge her to seek medical help for her own case of dystonia?  Or do I just play dumb and act like I don't see the signs.  I want her to get help if there is something that can keep her from getting worse, but I don't want her mad at me either. Hello.\nI am a doctor with dystonia, and I have passed it along to at least one of my kids.  Your cousing could be helped, and should be helped; but she needs psych help with facing this stigmatized disorder.  Dystonia is a strange dz in that it causes great family shame.  I know this 1st hand as my wife is having a hard time facing our reality.  I have 3 other children who are at risk.  Tell your cousin you love her; give her some articles on Botox, and tell her that there are people risking their entire careers on creating new solutions for her and her son.

What's the best sunscreen?  There's no one brand that's the best - but you do want one with a UVA-blocking ingredient as well as a UVB-blocker.  UVB ones are easy to come by - they're in every sunscreen - it's the UVA ones that are more difficult to find.\n\nLook at the ingredients list - there are only THREE tried-and-true UVA blockers (no matter what the label says).\n\nAvobenzone (aka Parsol 1789)\nTitanium dioxide\nZinc oxide\n\nAvobenzone is a chemical block - it absorbs the sun's rays and basically neutralizes the effect chemically.  The bad part about Avobenzone is that it does degenerate over a period of a few hours, so you need to reapply fairly frequently.\n\nTitanium dioxide and zinc oxide are physical blocks - they reflect the sun's rays, so they don't ever hit your skin.  Unfortunately, if you have darker skin and are using a product in which the particles of titanium/zinc have not been micronized properly, these products can leave a whitish cast on your skin.\n\nThe best thing to do to find a good-quality ZO or TD sunscreen is to check labels and expect to pay about $10-$12 for a tube.  It may seem expensive but isn't your skin worth it?\n\n[If you live in Canada or Europe there is a newer sunscreen ingredient available called Meroxyl - it's VERY effective at blocking UVA and UVB rays when blended with Avobenzone in a product - L'Oreal's Ombrelle line has this combination and it's great.  It's what I use, but it's not available in the U.S. - yet.]	health

They numbed it up so I couldn't feel it. I was so comfortable i could of went to sleep.\nThe second one had complications. The dentist couldn't get all the root out. It had calcified. He got out most of it but I could feel it when he was trying to get it out even though he numbed me up. i think it was cause of the complication. It was pain but not enough to make me cry. I just let him know I felt it.	health

I'm on Quinapril and I have a horrible head cold.  I used to take Dayquill. What do I take now? I usually take OTC stuff for colds/allergies but I think the stuff I'm on now isn't supposed to be taken with OTC stuff.  What do I do to alleviate the sneezing, drippy nose, stuff head congestion? Take a hot bath, wrap yourself up in very heavy blankets (it will sweat your body out and release the toxins that are causing you to feel so badly). Drink hot herbal tea with lemon every hour or so. Avoid spicy food or cold drinks -anything that will aggravate it as sometimes colds can go to the throat too. Rest your head but sleep in an upright position so that you can rest easier. Get plenty of vitamin c and water. Honey also has some healing effects and can be good on warm toast. Soup is also perfect. But I don't recommend taking anything otc as nowadays they are having so many recalls (like the recent one on acetominiphin pain reliever pills). Just let it run its course and be sure to stay warm and keep your head and feet warm and dry. You'll feel better gradually but sleep, fuids, and rest are best.	health
what are cancer brain mets and do they hurt want info on this subject please?  If you are talking cancer with brain mets, this means that the cancer has spread to the brain area.  It may or may not hurt depending on the symptoms or where the cancer is first located in the body.  If there are tumors in the brain you may experience some headaches, vision changes, dizziness or balance problems, or neurological changes with numbness and tingling in the hands and feet or limbs of the body. It may have paralyzing limb changes, speech changes, memory changes, and stroke like symptoms as well.  This also depends on the staging of the cancer that the doctor decides with further testing, such as CT scans, MRI's and blood tests.  The mets ususally means metastasized, that it is more advanced and has originated in a different spot in the body to begin with.	health

Does tobacco itself have harmful elements? Cigarettes have a lot of thing added to them that are harmful, how about the tobacco plant itself? for example would be it bad if someone just smoked dryed out tobacco plant leaves? Good question, I think.  Nicotine is a physically addictive drug that acts as an euphoric and vasal-constrictor.  It can raise your blood pressure.  Tobacco also has tar and burning the leaves, burning ANYTHING gives off carbon monoxide.  Tar sticks to your lungs and gets in your blood.  It can cause body cells to turn into cancer cells.  Carbon monoxide makes it hard for your blood to carry oxygen.  So.... smoking the leaves is still dangerous.  Sorry.	health

can you claim benefit if you are diagnosed with fibromyalgia and unable to work.? I have this condition and support my blind,kidney dialysis dependant husband, with all the work I have to do to support my Husband this is making my condition worse, I am depressed and in constant pain making life very difficult, I  finished fultime work to look after my husband but my condition has got worse and the dss stopped my incapacity benefit which makes our finance situation worse and doesnt help my situation I have appealed against there discision the case comes up in december has anyone else been in this possition. I have M.E. I get income support (I was asked to choose between I.S and I.B- I chose the former because of the free NHS stuff). I also get DLA- middle care and high mobility. I also get blue badge/parking space at home and travel pass. \n\nAPPEAL!!! Get specialist help. A Welfare Rights Officer is who you need to see. I went to see one after being refused DLA for the third time to help me appeal and she went mad that I was refused after she read the medical report (which I requested a copy of). She also told me that the 2nd time I applied, the doctor who examined me was struck off and told me to appeal for that as well (as a late appeal). I won not only the appeal, but the backdated one too.\n\nGet to a Welfare Rights Officer now (they know what they are doing and seem to be feared by the DSS- they changed their mind about my recent appliction when I mentioned that I wanted all the info because I was going to see a Welfare Rights Officer). Its all very confusing. The DSS were at my appeal and were rude and scary and made me cry. \n\nBut just so you know, I don't think you can get Carers Allowance if you get DLA. And I hope your husband gets DLA as well as some other benefit. Not to mention a companion travel card and such, because he should. \n\nAs someone said, it is hard for the genuinely disabled due to those that just take it as an easy option or a reason not to work. Hence, perseverance shows genuine need.\n\nDon't be afraid to admit you need help and how much pain you are in. You are intitled to help. Appeal and apply for everything you can, the W.R Officer will tell you all you need to know. \n\nGood luck!	health

Do men get morning wood every morning?  Usually, but not EVERY morning. It is a morning erection that is naturally caused as the brains enters the REM-deep sleep phase. At this stage, the body's skeletal muscle structure relaxes and causes hypervasodilation in the capillaries of the body, resulting in said erection. The person has to be in the REM-deep sleep state.	health

to the doctors : is there a complete cure for reflux eosophagitis?? and irritated stomach? and how?  Still in medical school, but I'll give it a go.  Approximately 80% of people with esophagitis (esophageal irritation/inflammation) caused by gastric reflux have a non-progressive form that can be managed by  medications and lifestyle modification (losing weight if overweight; avoiding alcohol, chocolate, citrus juice, tomatoes, peppermint; avoiding large meals and waiting for 3 hours after eating before lying down; raising the head of your bed approximately 8 inches).  Medications used basically decrease the production of acid in your stomach and include things such as Pecid, Zantac, and Prevacid to name a few.  Antacids with meals are also a good idea.\n\nThere are a remaining 20% or so of people whose esophagitis will continue (despite medicaitons) to progress and cause permanent scarring which can increase a person's risk for esophageal cancer.  For those people, the best option is surgical.  Surgery consists of a procedure called a Nissen Fundoplication.  This can be done laparoscopically (camera with small holes, small instruments, small scars, quicker healing).  The procedure basically consists of wrapping the upper portion of the stomach partially around the esophagus.  What happens is that after a meal, the stomach fills up, causing the portion of stomach wrapped around the esophagus to tighten up a bit, creating a valve of sorts.  This prevents acid from refluxing into the esophagus.  Assuming all goes correctly, the procedure typically lasts 2-2.5 hours, you go home in 2 days, and you're back to normal more or less in 2-3 weeks.  ~92% of patients have resolution of symptoms.  No surgery is without it's complications,   so do some reading about it if you're considering.  In addition to "the usual" (bleeding, infection, anesthesia complications, etc.), it's always possible that the valve they make will be too tight and you won't be able to properly swallow your food.  Rare, but it happens.  \n\nAs for "irritated stomach", I would need more information to know what you mean precisely.  Hope this at least offers some answers to one of your questions.  Good luck to you.	health
Yellow dye # 5 ? --in Mountain Dew. Does Yellow #5 cause cancer? Doesn't Mountain Dew still contain Yellow # 5? I read LONG ago that Yel.#5 might cause cancer (bladder cancer).

What are some causes for a bloody nose? I have never gotten a bloody nose before, but I've had a bunch just this year.  I had surgery on my sinuses last march, but the first time that I got one was this January.  It only bleeds on my right side, and afterwards my head hurts on that side.  It hurts for at least a day. well it could be because u have nasal polyps, bloody noses and headaches are common signs and symptoms.  poylps are just little outgrowths of tissue, you can get them anywhere in your body where there is tissue.  Another sign/symptom is snoring - ask your significant other if u snore at night.  but either way, u should get it looked at.  these types of polyps can be removed by nasal sprays or by outpatient surgery.  deffinatly get it looked at!

Is there any personal trainers out there who could give me a few tips? I am 15, 135-140 pounds 5'5. I want to tone my stomach and thighs. I am not fat, just chubby. I don't want to lose weight necessarraly, just sculpt and tone. i dont have weights and hardly have time to do even an hour of workout. I also have a really hard time eating right b/c my parents won't buy me diet food. I need some easy tips so tone and sculpt within the next 2 months that won't cost hundreds of $'s. You are not overweight!!! You are an ideal weight for your height.  The best way to focus on your goal of toning is to pay attention to what you eat.  Eat a healthy diet of vegetables, chicken, fish, turkey and whole grains will help.  Do not starve yourself and do not eat too many greasy foods.  It is ok to eat fast food from time to time but I recommend you fix your own foods or eat what your parents fix at home because these foods are much better for you.  Eat baked chicken instead of fried.  Any meat the is baked or grilled is better than fried meat. \n\nDo not deprive your self of things you like just make better food choses for example a double cheese burger versus a home made grilled chicken sandwich with no toppings but lettuce and tomato on whole grain bread.....or a healthy salad with chicken and various vegetables.  Take one multi-vitamin.  Evercise for 45 minutes a day.  This should include cardio.  Cardio is running, bike riding, and aerobics.  Cardio is what makes you sweat.  If you sweat you will lose the fat.  \n\nFocus on muscle groups not body parts.  There are various exercises you can do to tone the lower abs and upper abs.  When working on your abs focus on upper lower and sides.  Belly dancing helps tone abs.  Walking up stairs a lot makes you have a nice butt.  \n\nYou could also turn on the music and dance to your favorite tunes at home.  What I recommend is for you to get an exercise tape such as a pilates work out. Pilates works very well.  It will give you the results you need.  Then make sure you have 8 cups of water a day to flush out the fat.  So, just eat right and evercise.  \n\nFocus on overall toning not zone toning.  Last of all accept yourself some parts of you may just be naturally big.  This is what I learned from a personal trainer.  I have big legs and a big chest.  I will always have big legs...the goal here is to just make the big legs look good.  I also have always had a ruler body and had the misconception that everyone should have an hour glass figure.  As a teen, seeing the models on tv made me really believe this.\n\nAccept your body is still beautiful.  A little plumpness is not a sign of being a little too chubby.  Plus my daughter has a little belly poking out but she is not fat.  My advice to her was that she was no longer a size 5 and should be wearing a 7.  After going to the store she found out I was right.  She exercises and eats healthy.  She does not diet.  She just is aware of what she eats making healthier choses and maybe an occasional fast food dinner.  \n\nSo you do not need to really go on a diet. About.com has a whole bunch of information that will help you.  It is loaded with information.\n\nIf you still feel uncomfortable talk to your doctor and he or she will help you understand healthy weight, healthy eating and getting enough exercise.  He or she will be able to let you know what you are doing right or wrong or whether you need to do anything at all.  \n\nBut I still think nothing is wrong.	health

The pill?? Hi there.\nI am an 18 year old girl from the UK. I'm going away for 2 months this year, and wouldnt like to have my period while I am away.... I would like to get the Pill, but how/what should I ask my doctor? \nThanks Talk to the doctor, get the pills and take them. \n\nAsk if he would prescribe pills so you won't have your period for longer than the normal 28 days. Standard bc pills make your body think it is pregnant so the menses are suspended. At some point the pills turn into placebos, or they run out and your body goes back to having the period. So, you have to ask the doctor if you can do it. He will give you pills that won't go to placebo or won't run out before your next desired period.	health

what can one do you get rid of chronic hives ?...Antihistamines dont work...nothing works !?  Oh you poor thing.  I suffered with the same thing for months after the birth of each of my children.  My Naturopathic Physician said it was the anistetic that was causing the reaction in my case and nothing worked.  Diet helped some (no acidic foods),  I also drank lots of water and no alchohol (well, little and extra water on those days).\n\nI had an MD say that he could get me on the list with the best dermatologist in town, but no body really knows exactly what causes hives and all the derm will do is allergy stress tests and tell you to alkalinize your diet (no meat, sugar, etc.) until the problem goes away. I told him that I had success sleeping through the night using Claritin, so he didn't prescribe me anything stronger (I was nursing anyway - I didn't want anything stronger really).\n\nI think that the hive reaction was caused by stress - tremendous amounts of stress brought on by having a new baby, each time.  I think the single best thing I did for myself was turn to Louise Hay to help have a positive and relaxed attitude about my situation and I think that more than anything helped.  According to Louise Hay, hives are caused by small, hidden fears and making mountains out of mole hills.  She says the cure is to remind yourself as often as you can "I bring peace to every corner of my life".\n\nThat's what I did.  I tried to relax and bring my own peace to my own life and before long the hives were gone - I hardly noticed.  Someone said "How are those hives?"  one day and I said "wow, you know they haven't bothered me for a while".  I had just stopped thinking of them.\n\nIn the mean time, cold water compresses can help and soaking in a warm epsom salt bath.  There's also a great product called Coral Calcium, you can put that in the bath and in your drinking water to futher alkalinize your system - lots of veggies will too.\n\nTake heart - it will end.  Peace!	health

What is the best way to keep up motivation in an attempt to lose weight? I need to lose 25 pounds by December. (And I'd really like to lose 10 by the time I go back to college...in August!) \nThing is, I have willpower, but only in spurts. What is the best way to stay motivated to do all the things to lose weight (like, limiting calories and going to exercise and all that jazz)? Sometimes keeping a food diary can help. Sometimes we don't remember how much we have snacked on during the day. The food diary can help you see if you are snacking excessively or help you see a bad habit. \n\nIf snacking is your problem you can look into a couple of options. You can cut down on your snacking or plan for healthier snacks. Don't drastically change your diet unless you know that you can stick with it. Otherwise you just gain all of the weight back because you go back to old habits. Just change a little at a time. Try having two "healthy meals" a week. Something as simple as having grilled food, instead of something fried. \n\nAlso, to lose weight you really need to do some type of exercise. Find something that you enjoy doing. You will be more likely to stick with it. Maybe walking, swimming, yoga, dance, aerobics. Just whatever you find interesting. If you bore easily you may want to try doing more than one thing. For instance, walking with friends on Monday and Wednesday, yoga on Tuesday and Thursday. The next week try dance on Mon. and wed. and aerobics or Tues. and Thurs.. You just have to find what works for you. The most important thing is to keep it fun and interesting. Take time and try some new things!\n\nI hope these suggestions were helpful. Good luck and just keep the faith in yourself. You can do it. You just have to decide that you are ready to.	health

how to see if i have a default out look express mail set up?  You have 3 options.  The simplest is to double click the outlook express shortcut and see what happens when it opens.  If it takes you through the account setup wizard then you don't.  The other option is to click on an email link on the web somewhere.  This should start outlook express and run the wizard if there is not an account setup yet.  The final option is to go to the control panel and click the mail icon. This will take you into the email settings and let you check to see if there is one already established.	computers and internet
Will spammers win over the spamfighters one day? It seems that for every anti-spam measure there is a new spam method popping up. Will I live to see the day spam is gone - from mail as well as the eb? Spam email will disappear when it is no longer economically feasible for the spammers. As long they can send out a few million spam emails and make a couple of million dollars on that they will continue to do it.  SO the answer lies with people who receive the spam email NEVER responding to or buying anything from a spam email they have received. It's not the spammers' fault that these spam emails keep coming; it's the fault of the people who receive them and respond with wads of cash.\n\nThis is the same reason why prostitution is still going strong after thousands of years: there is a market for it that is positively insatiable.	computers and internet

how is it i have to have several different spyware programs to get rid of the stuff that gets put on my comput I had Norton everything, adaware, and the yahoo toolbar.  These have served me for awhile.  Then somehow a bunch of adware and a trojan got by all of this and my firewall and infected my computer badly.  I had to uninstall  norton and install defenderpro.  WHY did that happen, when I paid good money to be protected? I agree with Norm on Norton. This site will answer your question, great information , I put a very small part of some of the information below, check this site out to get a better understanding to the question you asked..\n\nhttp://www.techsupportalert.com/free-vs-paid-av-part2.htm\n(It's a fair question. The current security threat is so great that you can argue that PC users should be protecting their machines with the very best products available regardless of whether those products are free or commercial.\n\nIn this multi-part series we'll look at the best free anti-virus scanners, anti-trojan products, spyware detectors and see how they stack up. \n\n1. No computer security product is perfect; all products have less than 100% detection. The choice between products commercial and free products is thus not a choice between perfection and something less rather it is a choice between differing levels of imperfection.\n\n2. In absolute terms the best commercial AV products such as NOD32 do have higher detection rates than the best freeware versions. However the difference between the rates is relatively small.\n\n3. By combining two or more freeware products it is possible to get better detection rates than the best commercial AV programs used alone.\n\n4. Layering is an attractive option for improving malware detection rates and may well offer greater opportunities than concentrating on looking for a near-perfect single product.\n\nIn the next part of this series I'll look at the effect of adding even more layers of protection)	computers and internet

Describe a Web services application.? Describe a Web services application for monitoring the clarity of water of lakes in Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has placed a wireless sensor under the water in the middle of each lake that measures the clarity every minute and reports a single number indicating water clarity. The sensors have wireless network connections and each run a Web server that reports \nthe result as a simple HTML page. The sensor has limited power, so you want its Web server to only be touched once per minute. Your Web service runs on a computer on the shore of each lake. It scrapes the screen of the sensor Web site, and presents the results as a Web service. We want a main DNR Web site to have a display of the clarity of water in all of the lakes in the state. \n\nDraw an architecture of the entire system, including the \nsensors and the final Web site. Explain how it works. \n\nWhat are the practical and philosophical differences between \nhaving the sensor run a Web server and a web service directly Technically a web server is a web service - of sorts.  It responds to HTTP requests, typically with HTML documents.  However, the documents do not adhere to the SOAP standards implemented by most newer web services so the only recourse is to hunt the HTML for keywords and tags that indicate where the data you're scraping for is located.\n\nSince you have some practical limitations on how frequently these devices could be called, my first inclination would be to develop a centralized "collection" service that periodically polled the various clarity monitoring devices and stored the data in a local database (timestamped from an accurate, central time source).  It would still do the "scraping" from the various devices, but would act as a proxy to minimize the amount of traffic each device was required to handle.  The polling interval would be based upon how frequently you needed to update the data.\n\nI'm assuming these devices can be accessed via TCP/IP.  Lacking any drawing tools, the architecture is fairly simple.  \n\n[Polling Server] -- [Clarity Monitoring Devices]\nÂ Â Â Â |\nÂ Â Â Â |\n[Database Server]\nÂ Â Â Â |\nÂ Â Â Â |\n[Web Service]\nÂ Â Â Â |\nÂ Â Â Â |\n[Clients] or [Web Server]\n\nWhat would help is if you have the ability to modify the web page on the monitoring devices.  If so you could customize the HTML response to conform to a standard SOAP document that could be called as a remote object from the polling server (instead of having to parse the HTML).  Alternatively, you may also be able to have the web server on the monitoring devices respond in an XML format that can be much more easily parsed by the Polling Server.  I am assuming this is possible since the web server on these devices provides clarity information on-demand (which typically requires some sort of scripting).\n\nIf you would like additional details, please e-mail me at melancholygiant@yahoo.com.	computers and internet

Internet, computer, possible ventrilo problems, I don't know? Since yesterday, I've been randomly getting kicked off WOW, when I play. I believe it's due to ventrilo, but no one I know, seems to know how to fix it. When I get kicked off, not only do I get kicked off WOW, but I lose all connectivity with the internet as well. I have to then restart my computer and everything is back up again. Why is this doing this. I've check for upgrades, and redownloaded ventrilo, nothing seems to work? Could someone please clue me in with what's going on? Are you on dialup?\n\nIf you are on dialup, you cannot connect to any Ventrilo server unless it is set to ultra low quality. MOST servers are not set to low quality.\n\nYou will lose connection to Vent, Wow maybe even entire internet if Vent is trying to use more bandwith than you currently have on your connection.\n\nDoes this help?\n\nAlso as the source below suggests, you may be behind some sort of Firewall or router preventing packets or data flow.\n\nLastly (and in very rare cases) your internet provider may have certain ports or routing tables blocked to prevent specific internet activities from happening. I know a friend who was unable to play Battlefield 2 or WoW because her ISP had ports blocked preventing game play.\n\nTo check for lost packets run a trace route. This will test to see if you are losing data due to either your ISP or the game itself.\n\nIn Windows XP \n\n1. Go to Start\n2. Go to Run\n3. Type "cmd" (no quotes)\n4. Type "tracert <server name>"\n\ni.e. If the IP of the WOW server is 23.121.33.118, you will type \n"tracert 23.121.33.118"\n\nTo get the IP information of the WoW server you play on, please consult World Of Warcraft Official Website or contact a staff member of WoW. I neither play wow, nor have any information on its server details.\n\nThis should get the ball rolling. Does it help? let me know	computers and internet

The only way around it is to manualy end the programs process, wire thru another computer, or use a proxy. So if your sons not a raging computer nerd then the censorship wil be fine. What you will want to do is find one that makes a list of sites he can see instead of making a list of sites he can't see because let's face it as hard as you ever will try there will always be new bad sites made. I beleive google said there's now over 3,000,000,000 sites on the web with thousands made every day.\nI am doing some freelance programming with C++, and I hope within a little while I will be able to start writing a censorship program I can sell off to my school (they'd go for that because the creators always there to fix any problems) and i'd be glad to send you a copy after i'm done.\nWait if you're on Windows XP OS then go to the control panel then security center then firewall then click the tab that has to do with what sites they can, and can't see then to see one of those websites you type in the password.

Which is the best Linux distribution for home use ? And why?  Ubuntu is pretty user-friendly, and it's Debian based so there is a vast base of software available for it. Fedora Core is the free development branch of Red Hat Linux, and my personal favorite. It also has large amounts of packaged software specifically targeted to it's users. Mandriva is one of the easiest and most foolproof installations, and is more targeted toward the not so techies out there. Debian, Gentoo, and Suse require a little more knowledge of the Gnu/Linux OS, but are very powerful distros once you get used to stuff like command line in a terminal and such. Whichever you choose to start with, just jump in there! It's all free or nearly free, and runs just fine on an old $50 or $75 P3 that you can get off of Craigslist (or find in the dumpster if you are lucky!). Download the ISO, burn the disc, and see how you like the distro. If you don't like one then install another. Ubuntu will even mail you the install CDs for free if you don't have a CD burner or a fast internet connection.	computers and internet

In the movie "Braveheart"...were most parts for real, or made up for the movie? I know there was an actual William Wallace....but what other parts were real and/or fake? This is your luck day, I studied mostly medieval history in college. Well, the movie is a great one, one of my favorites, but alas no. The battle of Sterling Bridge in 1297 had a bridge. The English were bottlenecked and the Scots were able to exploit this and kill many crossing the bridge but many English just drowned as they had on a decent amount of equipment and most people then didn't swim. I don't know the whole story in detail, but Robert the Bruce got a bad wrap in the movie, he is a national hero in Scotland. Also, Wallace was not some landed peasant, he was a Knight and was reasonable educated.	entertainment and Music

Oh Geeez...\n\nOk here's one..\n\nTwo men went to mechanics school to learn how to put a car engine back together from all the parts.\n\nThe final exam was upon them which was to actually assemble the engine. The person that made the highest score had a position waiting for them with a well respected car manufacturing plant where they would be on a team to design new systems for the future.\n\nThe first guy was into engineering before this course the second was a former gynocologist, so naturally the gyno was nervous about passing the final exam.\n\nThe engineer was able to put his car together in record time, while the former gynocologist took twice the time to put his car together.\n\nThe instructor gave the highest score to the gynocologist, and the engineer was baffled, and upset.. then he questioned the instructor on the fairness of his grades.\n\nThe instructor said "It's true you both assembled so the engine ran perfectly, I gave each of you credit of 100% for being able to accomplish that.. but I gave an additional 100 points to the other guy because he did all the assembly through the tail pipe."	entertainment and Music

Do you think Prog Rock is becoming a lost art?  To a certain degree, yes. \nBut things run in cycles. There was a lull in progressive music in the '80's after the "art-rock" explosion of the '70's. Then, during the latter part of the decade, "Prog" started to make a come-back. \nNow, it seems as though it's hit another lull in the amount of true prog-rock bands that are out there. However, there are several excellent "Prog-Art-Rock" bands around.(The Mars Volta, Univers Zero, Cryptic Vision, Kino, The Flower Kings, etc.) The real trick is finding any of their material - especially, in the U.S. (Try these websites: www.prog4you.com - or - progarchives.com)\nProg music will always be around - it just will never gain any sort of mainstream acceptance. Which is good, because look what happened to "Metal" in the '80's when it became popular. I'm glad something finally came along to slay that monster. But why did it have to be "Grunge"?	entertainment and Music

Landslide by the Dixie Chicks.\nMy partner and I had been together for five months and everything felt so great. I was at University in a town far away from my home town and he lived in the town my University was in, working in a warehouse. My mother wasn't in favour of our relationship even though I was nineteen at the time, and told me I had to come home for the Summer. At the time, I didn't want to make her mad- and my father was really abusive and would have hurt either me or one of my sisters who still lived at home.\nI announced I had to go home for the Summer. I wrote it in a letter because I couldn't bear to tell him. We were and are really inseperable. \nI went into the bathroom and burst into tears, as he read the letter. When I came back into the bedroom, he was sobbing on the bed and had put on a song he said reminded him of me. It was landslide by the Dixie Chicks. The lines 'I'm afarid of change because I've built my life around you', really moved me and he was inconsolable. \nI managed five days back in my home town before I realised I could have a new life away from the abuse and emotional blackmail. I think that song tripped a switch in my brain that told me to go back to the man I love.\nI can't listen to that song now, it reminds me of our struggle to be together and how we had to build everything from scratch- how when I returned to him I did not bring anything because if I took a suitcase my parents would surely have realised what I was doing and made it so I couldn't go anywhere. My partner bought me clothes, he worked extra hours, and later I found a job so we could have a life together.\nWe are getting married in Feb and that song will play at our wedding.\nSorry this was so long, I just felt like telling someone...	entertainment and Music

the band "Him", do they have satanic lyrics?  Well to start off, the bands name, if I'm not mistaking, means His Infernal Majesty, if you look at my sources dictionary.com states the meaning of infernal as "Of or relating to a lower world of the dead."  So the name alone refers to the "Majesty" or king of the "underworld".  That alone would lead you to believe it so, but it is all about how you interpret things, "Wings of a Butterfly" , a song by H.I.M. and a personaly favorite of mine, refers to sacrafices and rituals, and ripping the wings off of a butterfly as if to save a soul, and refers to many gods, which isn't quite Christian, but theres constant talk of love and the bands symbol is the "Heartogram" dare I mind you it resembols the symbol of "witchcraft", "satanism", "wicken" or what have you it is more or less a symbol of a heart, which can be taken as love or loyalty to the devil.  Another aspect to concider is these guys are Finnish (as in they are from Finland) their culture is much different from America I imagine.  All in all I don't find their lyrics satanic or offencive, and personaly like H.I.M.  But you should read up on a couple songs and make your own judgement, I provided the partial lyrics to WoaB below and a link to its full lyrics, and you can search yahoo for the rest.\n\n"Wings of a Butterfly" - H.I.M.\nHeaven ablaze in our eyes \nWe're standing still in time \nThe blood on our hands is the wine\nWe offer as sacrifice \n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, and show them your love \nRip out the wings of a butterfly\nFor your soul, my love\nRip out the wings of a butterfly\nFor your soul\n\nThis endless mercy mile \nWe're crawling side by side \nWith hell freezing over in our eyes \nGods kneel before our crime\n\nBest of Luck,\nBrad D.	entertainment and Music

i need help to learn the violin? i'm very much interested in learning to play the violin but i am 22 so is that too late? (i can play the piano) .. i have no idea what do, i don't know what kind of violin to get and whether to get an instructor or not and where to get an instructor... how much should i pay for a violin and where can i buy one? i don't want something fancy....   please help To find a good, basic violin, search eBay under antique or vintage violins......Look for the Strad copies from around 188--1910.....These are mass-produced German/Czech violins, the type that our grandmothers or great-grandmothers ordered from Sears Roebuck and Wards mail order catalog......They will run from $100 to $300, depending upon age and condition. When these types of violins are fitted with a low bridge, they usually have a very good bright tone, with good sustain, and because of the wear and age, are easy to play.  Find a bow with some age on it, eBay, fleamarket, etc., preferably a Glasser horsehair bow.  With these two items combined, you should have a violin set that sounds good, and is easy to play.......very, very important when you are beginning to learn......The best fiddle players I've heard are self-taught......I've found a lot of instructors just have too much ego going with an adult player, and sometimes it's better to grasp at a few basics own your own. I have played and built violins for over 20 years. Good luck to you.	entertainment and Music

Is there an organization or company? in the U.S. that do/does not try to take money from people having a rough time?? I mean, like when you have to get help with your electric bill and FPL (electric co) keeps adding deposits to your account of almost $200.00?  I mean, people can't get a break anymore.  It's all companies - their late charges.  I consider almost $200.00 a fairly large "late charge" and they get away with it because they call it "additional deposit" even though they have your first deposit.  I'd like to hear if there are any positive organizations out there that make big bucks (like FPL) who are actually NICE to people who are struggling. I'd like to  know in my heart that they aren't all like that. Most people are 2 checks away from losing their home. We got 5 checks away because of a job loss and no one to borrow money from. We're okay now but I'd feel so much better knowing someone out there was NICE. Most utility companies have programs to help people. It's a matter of knowing how to enroll in that, I guess. Also drug companies have similar programs to give out drugs for free. I know many doctors give out brand sample drugs to their patients who need them. The programs to assist people are there, but, they don't come to you, you have to go look for them because these companies exist to make profit and not to help people.	business

has anyone heard of the racehorse Mill Reef?  Mill Reef (1968-1986) was a champion thoroughbred racehorse.\n\nHe was owned and bred in America at the Rockey Stables by Paul Mellon. He was a son of Never Bend, out of the mare Milan Mill. Sent to England in December 1969 to be trained by Ian Balding, Mill Reef won the Epsom Derby in 1971, after having come second in the 2,000 Guineas to Brigadier Gerard. Mill Reef went on the win the Eclipse Stakes one month later, and in the same month, the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot. In October, he completed an extraordinary year by winning the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\n\nKept in training as a four-year old, he did not have the same level of success, despite winning the Prix Ganay at Longchamp in April 1972, and, narrowly, the Coronation Cup at Epsom. He had the virus and in August broke a foreleg while training by stepping in a hole on the ground. He was saved, however, and went to the National Stud in 1973.\n\nMill Reef had a very successful career as a stallion, siring among others the winners in 1978 of both the Derby, Shirley Heights, and the French Derby (Prix du Jockey Club) Acamas.	business
Do men have a biological clock too?  Not really, men can have children much later in life than women.  Women know they only have a handful of years to have children, so they 'hear their biological clock ticking,' when they are getting close to the age when childbearing becomes difficult or impossible.  Men, on the other hand, can have children basically from puberty into their seventies and even eighties.	business

What is ur feeling about China is goin'to be the first powerful country in about fifteen years? I think it's time to change and i think Chineses people are more rigorous than Westerners... pamplmouss2 - \nThanks for asking.\nWhile former President Richard Nixon (with help from Henry Kissinger) opened the door to trade with this once-sleeping dragon, it seems as if global trade has shifted from American being a major EXporter to a major IMporter of Chinese-made goods.\nWith this new-found influx of American dollars, the Chinese government continues to suppress its people, pollute its land and flaunt its military strength.\nFormer President George H.W. Bush really helped China invade our economy and allowed further violation of human rights (i.e., \nTiananmen Square, 1989).\nIt was as if America bowed its head to the Chinese chopping block.\nOur current president is just as bad, showing little or no concern to turn the trade deficit in our favor.\nAmerica has been sold down the river.\nAs China grows, its demand for energy (i.e., oil - the stuff that drives our bigass SUV's) creates a supply/demand rise in petroleum prices.\nAnd guess who suffers?\nAm I angry at Chinese people?\nNo.\nAm I angry at our own government for selling us out?\nYes.\nThe Chinese are playing by their rules...we don't have to play, but we choose to do so.\nWe're to blame for losing our leadership in goods and services.\nAnd as history has shown, nations rise and fall.\nSome three thousand years ago, China was a world leader.\nI suppose the pendulum of time is swinging back in Chinas' favor.\nWe Americans are so caught up with our self-infatuated image that we still don't see it coming.\nWe'd rather watch "American Idol" than study the lessons of history, learn math and science and re-energize our nation.\nWe get what we deserve.	business

How to get a more proffesional job for 1st yr undergrad  Commerce student? Just finished 1st yr Commerce at UBC (im 20). I can get low skilled jobs easily; however, wat i focus on is not only making money but also EXPERIENCE-professional exp. such as a helper in the bank, work for telus/rogers, and "real" companies. ANyone noe Any places that provide workers with prof. experience? \nI also do tutoring. But how do i start tutoring ONLINE? No idea. Thx :D you gotta start somewhere. you can get professional jobs right out of college but they'll be, depending on what you're looking for, manager trainee or asst. something. look at it this way, you haven't any professional expereince but are looking for work at a place that is "professional." stepping stones you know. gotta learn to crawl before you can walk. find something along the lines of work you're looking for. stick it out for awhile, then start looking for the real job you want to get. if you want to work at a bank, start off as a teller or a sales associate. you'll learn everything you need to know and in a 8-10 months you'll know enough to shop yourself around and look for something more professional. education nowadays is expected but really amounts to nothing. experience is what employers look for. can you do the job, have you ever done it before, have you been successful in the past. they need documented track of success or very good references that prove to them you are capable of handling the job and responsibilites. no one gives professional experience, you gain it. like i said, you have to start somwehere. sounds to me like your looking for the quick fix to your career search and it's very unlikely you'll ever find it. might get lucky but most likely you'll just keep looking and find nothing.	business

i did a big mistake my account is over draft about $1,000 dollar? because i made a check without having the money on the bank my mom help me pay put i forgot to cancel the check and they took the money from the bank and know my mom is super mad with me what should i do she does not even want to look at me or talk to me and if she talks to me she sceems at me so what should i do i live at home with my mom fess up to the mistake and chalk it up to experience. 20 yrs from today you'll never know the difference. the deal to deal with now is the correction of the problem, not ponder over spilt milk. you mom should be able to co-sign for you at the bank for an overdraft acct. and cover the losses and pay the bank or your mom off in quick smaller pmts so not to kill anyone off and press on to bigger and better things...like life and the love of a mother for her daughter and visa versa.\nif that doesn't work...let me know, i'll pull something out of my bag of tricks.\nluck	business

There are so many documentaries on the negative aspects of Wal-Mart. Is Wal-mart really that bad? I suspect they are. What have YOU heard?? No. It is a successful business so it is a large target of the "looters".  Read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.  There are those in society that create and those that loot.  \nCurrently, they've attracted the eye of the unions.  They see a pot of money that they haven't usurped, so they've started a campaign to get it.  The liberal media has picked up on it as well as liberal politicians that are bought and paid for by the unions.\nThat is what is happening with Walmart.	business
Tell me something about the history of August?  August is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar and one of seven Gregorian months with the length of 31 days.\n\nAugust begins (astrologically) with the sun in the sign of Leo and ends in the sign of Virgo. Astronomically speaking, the sun begins in the constellation of Cancer and ends in the constellation of Leo.\n\nIn 1945 the end of the Second World War was brought about following the August 6 bombing of Hiroshima and August 9 bombing of Nagasaki in the first and only use of nuclear weapons against civilian targets. Emperor Hirohito declared Japan's unconditional surrender on August 14.\n\nAugust was named in honor of Augustus. The month reputedly has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days as Julius Caesar's July. Augustus placed the month where it is because that is when Cleopatra died. Before Augustus renamed August, it was called Sextilis in Latin, since it was the sixth month in the Roman calendar which started in March.\n\nIn the pagan wheel of the year August begins at or near Lughnasadh in the northern hemisphere and Imbolc in the southern hemisphere.\n\nIn Ireland, (in the Irish language) August is known as LÃºnasa, a modern rendition of Lughnasadh, named after the god Lugh and August 1, (LÃ¡ LÃºnasa) in the Irish Calendar is still regarded as the first day of Autumn. The first Monday in August is one of the public holidays in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSome of Ireland's most famous battles have being fought in this month. They include - theSecond Battle of Athenry (1316); the battle of Knockdoe (1504); the Battle of the Yellow Ford (1596); the First Battle of Curlew Pass (1599); the Battle of Dungans Hill (1647); the Battle of Castlebar (1798), and the Battle of the Bogside (1969).\n\nIn the old Japanese calendar, the month is called hatsuki (èæ).\n\nIn Finnish, the month is called elokuu, meaning "month of reaping".\n\nIn the UK, August is generally when all academic exam results are published, especially for GCSEs and A-Levels as well as other exams. Also, scholars and school workers such as teachers, have a holiday or non-contact time, and there are two bank holidays (UK). It is typically when people go on holiday due to the availability of time.\n\nDuring August 13 to 19, Philippines schools and theaters celebrate the National Week of the Filipino Language.\n\nIn Spain, August is the holiday month for most workers.\n\nIn Brazil, folk superstition associates bad luck to August, with the proverb "Agosto, o mÃªs do desgosto" ("August, the month of misfortune") being often heard. This may come from the sinister memories of the St. Bartholomew's day (August 24), which is particularly dreaded in the Northeast of the country. August 24 is also, in the tradition of CandomblÃ©, the day of Eshu, one of the most malevolent deities. Coincidentally, some unfortunate polical events took place in August, like the suicide of the then President GetÃºlio Vargas. [1]\n\nEvery last Sunday of August, the Philippines celebrates National Heroes Day in commemoration of the First Cry of the Philippine Revolution on August 23, 1896.\n\nAugust is also the name of a Japanese visual novel company.	business
How do I find a consultant job without any consultancy experience? I have over 10 years working experience most of which is in Hong Kong.  I now reside in the North West of UK.  I have an MBA and a Diploma in Management Studies.  However, I am finding it difficult to obtain positions that would allow me to progress in career.  All I seem to find is administration monotonous jobs.  Does anyone else have the same problem?  I would like to join the consultant profession, as details of it appears to correspond with my desires in a career.  Although I do have management experience, employers here seems to disregard it.  I do have references from permanent positions that I have held in Hong Kong, but no one seems to be interested in looking at them. NETWORK, NETWORK, NETWORK!!!  Highlight your education and your work experience.  Let EVERYONE know that you are available to consultant on whatever types of projects you are looking to do.  Think about starting small (maybe taking a few assignments that you ordinarily would not take) just to get your name out there and get your foot in the door.  Always have your contact/business card available along with a resume summarizing your experience and stating the services you offer.  \n\nGood luck!	business

I paid a prepayment penalty on my morgage company.  Can i get that back  at the end. or  its tax deductable?  Yes, a prepayment penalty is deductible.  It's essentially a payment in lieu of the interest the lender would have earned had you not prepaid.  It's deductible as interest.\n\nFrom the IRS website (pub. 936):\n\nMortgage prepayment penalty.   If you pay off your home mortgage early, you may have to pay a penalty. You can deduct that penalty as home mortgage interest provided the penalty is not for a specific service performed or cost incurred in connection with your mortgage loan.	business

Why do some companies give out dividends and some do not? I have noticd even high profit companies dont give out divdends and some do..or vise versa, a low profit will give out nice dividends......why does a company not choose to do dividends and is it possible the could start doing it? Does that ever happen? Some companies choose to reinvest their profits to make their company grow. Companies that do not give out dividend can and do start giving them out, either as special dividends or regular dividends. Just a little while ago, Microsoft gave out a huge dividend as a one-time deal. If a company does not give out dividends, you make your money when you sell the stock. Any retained earnings should increase the value of the stock.	business
Are Online make money at home themes Scams? I am on disability ss and need to make extra money at home no jokeing Hi L,\n\nThis is a topic that I have studied in much detail over the past 3 years. There are ALOT of ways to make money online, however, the moment you log on to the internet you are bombarded by ALOT of different sites telling you how to make money and that you`ll be a millionaire overnight. It takes time to filter out the crap from the genuine income generating programs. \n\nI have researched literally thousands of the different offers I'm sure you see every day on the internet. You could spend a fortune trying all these different business opportunities out for yourself. I did and believe me 95% of them didn't work but now I'm making quite a bit using a number of different websites. \n\nOne of the ones I found worked best is Protry.com or DataEntryPros. \n\nBasically you sign up with them and then simply enter in lines of data they give you, send it back and they send you out a check! I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $200-$300. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra bit of cash aswell as my full time job (which I love!) so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \n\nYou do have to be prepare to spend a small amount of money but just do what I did..all of these sites offer a 30 day money back guarantee..use them for 30 days, make some cash then just cancel the \nsubscription...I know you won`t though! :o) \n\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \n\nHope this helps!\nGoodluck,\nMatthew	business

what do you think about purchasing I-Bonds?  I wouldn't buy I-bonds at the moment.  Once you buy them, you can't sell them for at least a year.  You can do just as well (earn a rate equal to or better what you can earn on an I-bond) putting money into a six month or one year CD.  Or perhaps a money market fund (search around, you can earn 4.5% in a basic MMF as of now), which would pay a tad less than a one year CD, but presumably the rate will increase going forward as there is little reason to think the Fed is done raising rates.	business
What does it mean when something is prorated? Dictionary.com doesn't give a good enough definition for me.  It doesn't have an example. A good example is when you buy a new car battery.  Maybe for one whole year if that battery goes bad, they will replace it free. After the year, if the battery goes bad you will not get a free replacement but will get maybe 75% of the price of your battery. The longer you have the battery the less the replacement sum will be. It is prorated according to how long you have had the use of the battery versus how much more use you are guaranteed. A five year battery that goes bad in the first year will be prorated to give you a free battery or a pretty big portion of the cost of that battery. A five year battery that fails in the fourth year will be prorated according to the fact that this is a four year old battery with one more year of warranty. You might just get 25% of the value of a new battery.	business

what causes shortages and how can this be remedied?  Shortages happen when supply cannot keep up with demand.  In the short run, if the firm can do so, it has to bump up production.

Is there anyone who is truly serious about what the bible says in pure constantly consistent truth ??? I am a student of the bible and have been for the past 23 years. What I do learn from my studies I do to the best of my ability make it life itself.\n  I have no desire to be a teacher and am very content to remain a learning student. My problem is I in these 23 years have found not one except my companion that is with an open mind willing to search for the pure truth. many say with words they are but when it comes to correction of an idea or concept they have in place no corection is accomplished. such is due to the true motive in their innate nature known or unknown by them which prevents such change. To put it sn simple form their idea is to teach me and not to share in reasoning so both can grow.\n  In my opinion the bible does explain itself complete and is a complete book. thus the bible, reasoning, and an open mind on the part of both parties is all that is required but I have found only one so far and am looking for more if there is. \n  email cjkeysjr@yahoo.com if serious. it is hard to read yor email so here is mine zaxton6@yahoo.com just in case you made a typo	business

Describe the difference between a mortgage and a deed of trust.?  The basic difference between the mortgage as a security instrument and a Deed of Trust is that in a Deed of Trust there are three parties involved, the borrower, the lender, and a trustee, whereas in a mortgage document there are only two parties involved, the borrower and the lender. In a Deed of Trust, the borrower conveys title to a trustee who will hold title to the property for the benefit of the lender. The title remains in trust until the loan is paid. \n\nOften a title company, escrow company or bank, is listed as the trustee on the Deed of Trust. When the loan has been paid, the trustee will issue a release deed or trustee's reconveyance deed. This deed of reconveyance should be recorded at the county recorder's office, to make public notice that the loan has been paid and that the lender's interest in the property has ended. \n\nAnother difference between a mortgage and a deed of trust is the manner in which foreclosure proceedings take place. State law will determine the method of foreclosure which must be used. Generally, the rules when using a Deed of Trust allow for a faster foreclosure time than with a judicial foreclosure required with a mortgage. Under a Deed of Trust, when the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender delivers the Deed of Trust to the trustee, who then is instructed to sell the property. \n\nAfter proper notices have been posted and rules are followed, the property is sold at a trustee's sale and the loan is paid. Be careful not to confuse a deed, which conveys title and is evidence of ownership to property, with a Deed of Trust, which is a means of securing a note and providing for foreclosure proceedings.	business

The odds are very poor whether you are in Australia or US -- unless you have something to provide the bank as collateral. A restaurant is not something that you can do for $1000 only -- you need more; and for a financial institution to give you a loan, you need to show that you are capable of repaying the loan, that you have a strong business, you have experience in the business or a strong management team will help you, you have collateral and you have the right character. Banks simply want to make sure that they can get their money bank. Right now, with your conditions, you are too-high risk to be provided with a loan.	business

How do I find her to pay for my car damage? (Estimate damage is $1211.47) I live in North Carolina Hi, Did you get her license plate number off of her vehicle?  If so, you should be able to track down the vehicle through the department of motor vehicles, if your state allows it.  If you have no luck there, it sounds like you have a situation where you may need to file a small claim suit against her which should cost you around $100 and you can ask the judge for reimbursement for this amount (providing you can at least get her mailing address to file with).  If not, sounds like you are stuck with paying for your own repair.  It might be a good idea to shop around and get more than one estimate for repair...good luck	business

Can just anyone obtain my credit report?  Obtaining someone elses credit report without permission is a federal offense.  That said, it used to be as easy as knowing your SSN and birth-date.\n\nNowadays, it is a little more tough.  Online Credit agencies will ask several security questions that are not easy to answer.\n\nFor example, they might say something like:\n "Which of the following accounts did you close in 1999:"\n   "a) Sears"\n   "b) Home Depot"\n   "c) Chase"\n   "d) Citibank"\n\nThere are a series of these questions, whatever they know from your SSN, they can ask for, addresses, accounts, etc.\n\nNow, somebody like a spouse in an ongoing divorce can easily know all that information and obtain a credit report.  However, even this inquiry will show up on the credit report.  If you pull it yourself, you could see that someone else got it (not always easy to read).\n\nIn the case I mentioned of a spouse in a divorce  it is hard to tell what the authorities would do.  It would likely not be investigated, and it depends on the state and judge.  If there was an order to respect the others privacy, it would at least be contempt of court.\n\nBut again:\n  - every time your credit-file is pulled, there is a entry made (stays for 3 months)\n  - it is a federal offense, if you think someone got it against your will, call the agency you got your report from and ask for an investigation.\n  - Last but not least, all your creditors are allowed to pull your credit on a regular basis	business
can a hospital  sue for unpaid medical bill?  Not only can they sue -- they will sue. And when (not if) they win, they will garnish your wages for the original bill plus hefty late fees and interest (usually done by the collection agency they turn your bill over to). I have several people working for me who are having their wages garnished now for medical bills. Best get on, and stick to, a payment plan now. These bill do not just go away. \n\nDon't be fooled into thinking that a "non-profit" hospital is a "charity." The two words are not synonyms. This mentality is just one of the many causes of the rise in healthcare costs. Hospitals spend millions trying to collect unpaid bills. If you were sick, and you received the care, you owe the money.	business
are condoms 100%safe? if not why arent they?also if not why do we use them?  Condoms are definitely NOT 100% safe against pregnancy or any STD's. They aren't 100% safe because they can break or slip off during intercourse or they can have a flaw (tiny hole) from when they were manufactured. People use them because they do offer some protection (very little protection against pregnancy), but they should be used in combination with other protection. =-)	business

We Puerto Ricans do not want statehood at least not more than the 50% so it can't be done.

Is anyone old enough to remember? When the government wanted the Alaskan pipeline (1970s), they told the American people that this would solve our oil problems with relation to importing oil. Does anyone remember this? I go further back than that (UK). In the late 50's when the British Government were building their first Nuclear Power Stations they boasted that electricity would be so cheap in the 1980's that it would be uneconomical to read meters and send out bills.  But would you ever have believed even 25 years ago that people would be paying prime prices for water now.  In fact it is dearer than petrol over here.	politics and government
Drink driving charge? A freind of mine was caught drink driving on Sunday night. He was over the limit and took to the station, he was not charged until the following day at 2.30pm.\nSome of our other friends are saying he should have been charged whilst drunk and read his rights etc. I think they must have let him sober up before charging him etc. Does anyone know what the procedure is?\n\nPlease note that I totally disagree with what he has done. The Police will make sure that he is sober before they charge him.  He will learn his lesson though because he will know lose his licence.  It will have to be returned to the DVLA.  He will have to take it to Court with him when he attends.  If it is a new plastic licence he will have to take the counterpart paper bit with him.  The Magistartes have guidelines to follow depending on the level of intoxication.  When he goes tell him to say that he could lose his job without his licence and this could seriously affect his livelihood.  Tell him to be really remorseful about the situation.  This may lean the Magistrates slightly!\n\nIf he goes on the Drink Drive Rehabilitation course he will get a third of the time taken off his ban.\n\nMay I say that many people will knock him but it takes your body 1 hour to disperse 1 unit of alcohol and you start counting 1 houtr from when you last drank.  Many people don't realise that they are still over the limit the next day when they drive their cars. \nIt is my view that more education is needed to teach people the facts.  Many people who have been caught drink driving are VICTIMS due to this fact.\n\nI am sure your boyfriend is not a bad person, just a little foolish.  Thank god he wasn't involved in an accident, maiming himself or others, because that would be hard to live with!	politics and government

Can you file emotional distress in addition with another claim in small claims court? I had verbal agreement with man that moved me to town 60 miles away from my town and family.  I am on SSI as I worked in corrections and became disabled, largely due to Anxiety/Strss syndrome and major depression.  My therapist in hometown had advise against me moving closer to this man since he was a Dominant personality.  He also talked me out of moving in with my girlfriend.  Our agreement was I'd do housekeeping for him, we met on persoanls, and have a relationship.  I was to pay off my debt to him by working. He also still has some of my furniture.  Well apparently shortly after I moved up here he decided he didn't like me, and told me so.  After having a intimate relationship I told him it be hard for me to go back to friendship, especially he was only reason I moved up here.  He got  upset, said he was done with me, he'd keep my furniture and belongings until I paid off my debt.  Which was suspose to be worked off.  Can I ask for highest amount in small claims for mental distres This will have to take place in small claims court.  Depending on the state and the jurisdiction the law varies.  If it was a verbal agreement it's going to be hard to prove.  The best thing is to consult a attorney that will give you free legal advice..but you can file this in a small clains court yourself.  Hope I helped.	politics and government

Why is the world scared of Israel?  I don't think the world is scared of Israel.  They feel a need to protect it because of the history behind the creation of Israel after the holocaust of WWII. What I don't understand is why Israel is condoned for pushing the border to extend its land at the expense of Palestine.  Anyway from what I understand, the land that is now Israel was not viewed as the "promised land" by Jews, it was a place to live and heal after the holocaust. Most Christians in my part of the world believe that if Israel falls it will signify the end of the world as is written in the book of revelations.	politics and government

Because Africa is basically a politically unstable, economically depressed, disease ridden mess. \n\nSorry, I love Africa and have lived and worked there several times over the years but I wouldn't live there and I sure wouldn't want to bring up children there.\n\nEven the more stable countries like South Africa don't look like remaining stable in the long term, especially with the looming effectsof an HIV epidemic, and with examples like Zimbabwe to look upon people for what happens when such societies collapse people are understandably nervous.\n\nAdd to that the very limited oportunities for the middle class to make money and even the best African countries look like a poor choice compared to the 'Western' world for an educated young person.\n\nWhich is a shame because the best chance of solving those problems comes frm the educated young people. Unfortunately in a globalised world you can't really prevent brain drain. All you can do is adress the factors that promote it.	politics and government

Used to read an awful lot and soak up information like a sponge, so in terms of knowledge, I have a good bit.\nSlightly prejudiced.

There have been no cases in which a psychic was praised by the FBI or a US national law enforcement agency for helping to solve a crime, despite claims to the contrary by some psychics.

There is no recorded instance in England of any psychic solving a criminal case or providing evidence or information that led directly to its solution." (Inspector Edward Ellidon)\n\nIn LA:\n\n"The LAPD has not, does not and will not use psychics in the investigation of crimes, period. If a psychic offers free information to us over the phone, we will listen to them politely, but we do not take them seriously. It is a waste of time."

how to India became a powerful country? first of all remove illitracey nd than the orthodox in our country chage there view such as castism nd give a oppurtunity to the talent of our nation There are several many ways India can become a powerful country:\n\n1) First of all, get rid of all the muslims!!!  As long as this disease is in India, nothing positive is possible\n2) The government needs to be more effective in tackling all types of corruption.  They should promulgate stiffer legislation for corruption, and people who report cases of corruption should be awarded.\n3) Education must be made mandatory until 18 years old.\n4) the size of the armed forces must be increased two fold and there should be a increase in defence expenditure.\n5) The government should make much easier for ordinary people to access education and business loans\n6) Indians should be encouraged to "save" more.\n7) The millions of people living in poverty should be trained to produce certain goods.  Not only shall this enable them to work themselves out of poverty, but it shall be good for the level of Indian exports.\n8) India must undertake a much proactive effort to export goods to states, with whom our trade relations remain under developed and under utilised.  These include South American, Eastern European and African states.\n9) Our strength lies in services.  We should balance it out with production and manufacturing.\n10) In terms of foreign policy, we should augment relations with the USA, Israel, the EU states and Japan.\n11) Bodybuilding and Martial Arts (with a Hindu ethos) must be made compulsory in schools and colleges.  This will allow the Hindu man to change the international stereotype of him being a docile weak figure into that of a tough testosterone god.\n12) Our economy must be excelled in every way possible. Services, Manufacturing, exports, savings,.  At the moment India's natural resources remain ridiculously underdeveloped and under utilised.  This includes oil.  Oh and btw, the central forests (which Maoist rebels are occupying) are a rich source of aluminium.\n\nBefore we Indians can proceed to accomplish the aforementioned.  We must examine the encumbrances and obstacles that we face.  These include\n\n1) India's unwanted Muslim population\n2) Corruption\n3) Over population\n4) inefficiency in government and bureaucracy\n5) apathy on the part of Indians\n6) lack of funds, initiative and professionalism\n7) lack of patriotism and nationalism among Indians	politics and government
Is Bush behind the recent published Evangelical threat to overthrow the U.S. government? A report by the Evangelical Alliance published this week says, "violent revolution should be regarded as a viable response if government legislation encroaches on basic religious rights. The church is urged to come to a consensus that at some point there is not only the right but the duty to disobey the state."  \n\nThis is the same weirdo cult that Haggert was leader of.  Bush consulted regularly with Haggert. This is an excellent observation and connecting of dots!\n\nPresident Bush spent years and years politically empowering religious extremists, even though behind closed doors they were calling them "boorish" and "nuts" (as it was reported by David Kuo, an evangelical Christian conservative in his book, "Tempting Faith").\n\nThe Bush administration should have been very wary of what they wished for in this case. Such a hypocritical alliance indicates their political greed is extremely reckless and very harmful to our country.	politics and government

What happens in West Virginia when someone has no will? I have a friend who's great Aunt passed away. They have recently found out that she has a lot of money and things that will need to be divided. So far they haven't found a will and they thought that everything would then go to the closest living relative. Since then they have found out the land she was living on the deed for it is in her and her 2 sisters names and since one sister has passed away her son steps in and takes her part. The son is trying to take a lot more than his half and there are a lot of sentimental things that some of the family would like to have but are afraid that they will have to sell everything on the estate just to divide it all up. Please if you have any advice or websites that would help it would be much appreciated. They don't have a lawyer as of yet they were trying not to go there but will if they have to. Thanks! if the land is deeded to the sister, it will fall to her since the is the living relative, as for the ladies property and belongings... since he is next of kin and there isn't a will it all falls to him, along with any debt that is incurred from the dead.... the only thing that can be done is to contest, but that doesn't always work....... just had this appen to my in laws a few years ago and they live in w.va   hope this helps	politics and government
Would the US constitution be changed if the admendment received 2/3 of the popular vote.?  No.  Popular vote has nothing to do with it.\n\nThere are two methods:\n\nThe first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).\n\nThe second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.	politics and government

The unity and bond of the blackman would be strong as they would still be fighting together for the freedoms and rights deserved by any man today.\n\nIt is the assination of these two supreme human beings and freedom fiughters that  gained Americas sympathy and pushed the civil rghts movement forward...and hastened the Black Community to forget what they are fighting for in our present day.  Black youth would have a purpose and not just to get the best shoes or be all up in your face and loud and disrespectful.

Please give specific descriptions for reasons we should be in the war and/or reasons not to be in it. Thanks! Why is it called war on terror. Was it not called war on terrorism just a few months back ? I think that war is built on a lie. The lie about WMD being ready and able to be a threat to the US. I can only say that this was a picked fight and later grab for any reason to get it started. When it got started it was a point of no return. \nSaddam is and was a crook , he have been that in the  00s in the 90s and in the 80s . Even in the 70s. \n\nHere comes the part I dont understand. Why arming Saddam in the 80s like US did. They knew he was a crook but that didnt matter for Reagan or Bush sr. Who cared about the Iraqi peolpe back then supporting there oppressor. \n\nIn a way by being in Iraq at the moment and hopefully building something that will last will bring some ease on US as a nation that before supported the Iraqi peoples opressor. Like clean up there own mess in a way. \n\nBefore people begin jump me and call me anti american I will point out that US wasnt the only nation that supported Saddam in the 80s. But since the question specific relate to US and Iraq I have limited the answer or more correctly my point view in the issue.	politics and government

Does anyone really think it's OK for Illegal immigrants to sneak in to our country and drain our resources. Cheap labor my butt.  They have no health ins. so we pay for that. They pay no soc sec. no property taxes. Rarely have auto ins. are allowed to buy property and default on loans with no recourse or prosecution.  Commit crimes and are just sent back accross the border.  What's wrong with this picture.  How incredibly stupid can we be to say it's ok. Ya some people do think it's OK.  NOT ME!  Our government is a disgrace to our founding fathers and all our ancestors who died in battle for our right to sit here and discuss this issue freely.  Our government has forgotten what it is to be an American.  The care our government offers illegal immigrants is a spit in the face of my grandfathers, my widowed grandmothers and orphaned cousins.  Respect and gratitude for the sacrifices and pledges to our American Flag is almost gone.  We're turning into a country of sissy's scared of a few years of hard economical stress. Our compassion is misplaced.  I'm not afraid of the hard times we may go through if we send them all back where they came from.  My hard times are already here, an illegal stole my identity, ruined my credit and got my taxes this year.  I struggled for months to get a min. wage job and was beat out over and over again by illegals cuz I don't speak spanish and wouldn't fit in.  I don't make enough $ to buy health insurance for myself and my kid but I make too much to get health care for free.  I'm deep in debt and have not been offered a single break.  F*** this S***!  What do I have to be afraid of?  Economical set back in this country for a few years is the better sacrifice for me.

If i was President/Prime Minister... I would? Okay Answers Elections...\n\nSee who gets the vote!\n\nyou can vote on each of your colleagues answers! So lets have a fair fight!\n\nGive me your POLITICS!\n\nThe Election begins... first and foremost as your president I would put a cap on how long you can receive welfare.  and when you get a job you have to pay back what you "Borrowed". second, I would do away with "three strikes and your out". if you committ murder, rape, molestation, etc you automatically get life.  Third, everyone who reaches the age of 65 and eligible to retire will automaticall receive "FREE" health insurance.  Our eldery have done their part and they should not have to pay for their medicines and wonder how they will eat.  Fourth, Any person entering illegally will not have the luxury of applying for a temp. work visa, temp. social security number.  someone said once, "NO SOUP FOR YOU!" and thats exactly what you will get.  Why we hand out these benefits knowing they are illegal is just defeating the purpose.  By continuing this we are taking two steps forward and one step back.  Get here the right and legal way or don't come at all.  We understand the hardships you go through in your native country, but..quite frankly, we are not your native country and we have laws for a reasson.  and we all know priests do not become pedaphiles, pedaphiles become priests so they can engage in their sick behavior,  you will no longer be just "fired" and sent away to therapy.  You will be going to jail, I hear they have really good "therapists" that share your cell.  Prison sentence of "LIFE" in most states means 25 years, but LIFE will now be until you draw your last breathe.  We will no longer interfere with other countries and how they handle their business, if they choose to run themselves down or quite frankly, blow themselves up well...what ever floats their boat.

Should we pull out of Washington? If you consider that there has been an average of 160,000 troops in the Iraq theater of operations during the last 22 months, and a total of 2112 deaths, that gives a firearm death rate of 60 per 100,000. The rate in Washington D.C.(among others) is 80.6 per 100,000. That means that you are about 25% more likely to be shot and killed in our nation capitol, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, than you are in Iraq. Conclusion: We should immediately pull out of Washington, DC. I agree wholeheartedly, but only if we leave all of the politicians, along with the thugs.  Everyone else can withdraw immediately, including the families of the thugs and politicians.  Hurricane Katrina survivors can house the families of the politicians and corporate sponsors can take care of the families of the thugs.  Washinton,D.C. will have to be permanently sealed off as the dangerous jungle it is (after all, politicians roam free there) and no one allowed to ever escape it!  Our country will thrive once freed of the corrupt influence of the "Federal Government".	politics and government
Is a lease considered void if the landlord puts the house up for sale? If you are currently in a lease and the landlord puts the house up for sale does this void your lease? Not normally unless there's something in the lease to that effect.  A good lease would actually stipulate that the landlord had the right to put the property up for sale whilst you were still in it.\n\nHe can't force you out of the house if someone buys it, he can only force you out as per the terms of the lease - usually by giving you the requisite notice to quit or not renewing your lease when it expires.	politics and government

Many libs are turning a blind eye to their party ? In 1990, the House voted to reprimand Frank when it was revealed that Steve Gobie, a male prostitute that Rep. Frank had befriended after hiring him through a personal advertisement, claimed to have conducted a prostitution ring from Frank's apartment when he was not at home. Frank had dismissed Gobie earlier that year, and reported the incident to the House Ethics Committee, after learning of Gobie's activities.\nThe Boston Globe, among others, called on Frank to resign, but he refused. The House Ethics Committee recommended Frank be reprimanded because he "reflected discredit upon the House" by using his congressional office to fix 33 of Gobie's parking tickets. \nAnd why is this and Gerry Studds, McGreevy and other liberals highly worshipped? Take a look at this:\n\nTop 10 Democratic Sex Scandals in Congress\n \nFound this list at Human Events Online\nWhat Rep. Foley did was evil immoral and reprehensible. I hope he is fully punished unlike the below listed Democrats.\nhttp://www.humanevents.com/lists.php?id=17357\n10. Sen. Daniel Inouye. The 82-year-old Hawaii Democrat was accused in the 1990s by numerous women of sexual harassment. Democrats cast doubt on the allegations and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its investigation. \n9. Former Rep. Gus Savage. The Illinois Democrat was accused of fondling a Peace Corps volunteer in 1989 while on a trip to Africa. The House Ethics Committee decided against disciplinary action in 1990.\n8. Rep. Barney Frank. The outspoken Massachusetts Democrat hired a male prostitute who ran a prostitution service from Frankâs residence in the 1980s. Only two Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to censure him in 1990.\n7. Former Sen. Brock Adams. The late Washington Democrat was forced to stop campaigning after numerous accusations of drugging, assault and rape, the first surfacing in 1988.\n6. Former Rep. Fred Richmond. This New York Democrat was arrested in 1978 for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old. He remained in Congress and won re-electionâbefore eventually resigning in 1982 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug possession.\n5. Former Rep. John Young. The late Texas Democrat increased the salary of a staffer after she gave in to his sexual advances. The congressman won re-election in 1976 but lost two years later. \n4. Former Rep. Wayne Hays. The late Ohio Democrat hired an unqualified secretary reportedly for sexual acts. Although he resigned from Congress, the Democratic House leadership stalled in removing him from the Administration Committee in 1976. \n3. Former Rep. Gerry Studds. He was censured for sexual relationship with underage male page in 1983. Massachusetts voters returned him to office for six more terms.\n2. Former Rep. Mel Reynolds. The Illinois Democrat was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16-year-old. President Bill Clinton pardoned him before leaving office.\n1. Sen. Teddy Kennedy. The liberal Massachusetts senator testified in defense of nephew accused of rape, invoking his family history to win over the jury in 1991.\n\nSee the difference between the Republican Foley and these Democrats is that Foley was ostracized and resigned. These Democrats, including the ones you mentioned, were re-elected countless times and rewarded by the Democrats. And then there is Nancy Pelosi's support of the Man Boy Love Association.	politics and government

Milulski, Tom Daschle, & John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998.\n\n"This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer- range missiles that will threaten the United States "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of\nmass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." - President\nClinton, Feb. 4, 1998\n\n"If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear.We want to\nseriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." -\nPresident Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998\n\nIraq is a long way from here, but what happens there matters a great deal here.

What is Direct election?? o__O;? I have a stupid homework question that asks when the heck a direct election is. Thats my question! @___@ Direct election is a term describing a system of choosing political officeholders in which the voters directly cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The method by which the winner or winners of a direct election are chosen depends upon the electoral system used. The most commonly used systems are the plurality system and the two round system for single winner elections, such as a presidential election, and party-list proportional representation for the election of a legislature.\n\nBy contrast in an indirect election, the voters cast elect an assembly which in turn elects the officeholder in question. Some examples of indirectly elected bodies would include:\n\nthe Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of Europe, OSCE, the WEU and NATO - in all of these cases, voters elect national parliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly \nthe election of the government in most parliamentary systems - the voters elect the parliamentarians, who then elect the government from among themselves \nthe German Bundesrat, where voters elect the Landtag members, who then elect the state government, which then appoints its members to the Bundesrat \nthe election of the US President is technically indirect -- the voters elect the electoral college, who then elects the President -- although in practice it resembles a direct election for most purposes \nmost bodies formed of representatives of national governments, e.g. the United Nations General Assembly, can be considered indirectly elected (assuming the national governments are democratically elected in the first place, which is often not the cause)	politics and government

What is the U.S. Green card procedure after labor certificate approval and how much time it will take?  This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready.	politics and government
If a nuclear war happerned, but you weren't in an effected area would EMP still effect communication? For example the internet, CB radios etc.\nAny other facts about EMP would be good to, cheers!!!! Yes, due to the phone or transmission lines being impacted in the area of the blast.  Due to the nature of the grid system, however, the lines will be 're-routed' around the blast and should have you up in running in no time, that is, of course, if there are no other detonations elsewhere.  \n\nIt is also theoretically speculated that high enough kiloton yields at very high altitudes can have effects on the entire continent.  Since airborne tests were stopped in 1963, only computer simulations and theoretical projections have been made regarding the impact of the EMP.	politics and government

Who is the founder of the Peace and Freedom Party?  The Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) is a United States political party founded in 1967 as a leftist organization opposed to the Vietnam War.\n\nThe PFP gained its highest Presidential vote to date in 1968 when it nominated Black Panther spokesman Eldridge Cleaver for President. Although a convicted felon, Cleaver carried nearly 37,000 votes. Because Cleaver was only 34 years old, the state of California refused to put his name on the ballot, so the presidential line was blank, with only Vice-Presidential candidate Peggy Terry appearing. [citation needed] During this time period, Bob Avakian was a spokesman for the party in the San Francisco Area.\n\nBecause the party attained ballot status in 14 states and had no effective central control, its presidential ticket in 1968 varied from state to state. Although the national convention nominated Eldridge Cleaver for President, more than one state party put Dick Gregory on the ballot instead, as did parties called the "Freedom and Peace Party". The vice presidential nominee also varied from state to state. In California it was Chicago political activist Peggy Terry. In other places it was economist Doug Dowd. Cleaver had personally preferred Yippie leader Jerry Rubin as his running mate, but very few activists concurred.\n\nDuring the 1968 election, the New York Peace and Freedom Party consisted of a fractious coalition of competing Marxist groups along with libertarians led by Murray Rothbard.\n\nIn 1972, the PFP nominated democratic socialist and anti-war activist Benjamin Spock. Since then, the PFP has been active largely within the state of California, and it has been targeted by groups seeking its coveted California ballot spot.\n\nIn 1998, the PFP failed to attain more than 2% of the votes, causing them to lose ballot status in the state. Their position on the ballot was restored in 2003 after a voter registration drive, and convicted murderer/political prisoner and Native American activist Leonard Peltier was chosen as the party's 2004 presidential candidate at the August 2004 State Convention.\n\nThe party again fell under the required number of registered voters in February 2006, and was declared disqualified by Secretary of State. However, citing previous instances in which parties not meeting the 'ballot qualification' criteria were still allowed to participate in primary elections, and the fact that there had not yet been a regular gubernatorial election since the party regained its ballot status (and as such, the decision was premature), the decision to bar the party from the June 2006 Primary was reversed after less than a week.	politics and government

What is the best field in the military to do if i want to be in the CIA or Secret Service later? As an Officer Take advantage of DLAB schools. Always good to be fluent in a 2nd language. Military Intelligence would be best bet, but you should also have a college degree as well. Contact the CIA or visit their web site.

What's the difference between these churches? Pentecostal, Methodist, and Baptist.  I like Creflo Dollar and Joyce Meyer, do you know of any churches that preach in that fashion? Pentecostal~ On the day of Pentecost it was the release of the Holy Spirit into the hearts of the masses who wished to accept. Now, Paul was quite the preacher. On that day, everyone understood each other for a change. It was God's efficient communication device for a day. Paul was trying to get the people in control so he practically did them the way you get done in the military. Utilatarian clothing and modesty. Deciphering who was male and female. In today's religious arena is has become a circus. Women can't cut their hair. They wear god-forsaken dresses no matter where they work (when I was in the oilfields, I had a lady secretary who asked me HOW I could wear jeans and boots. I just told the truth. I said well I can afford to go out onto the oil leases and bend over in front of the team in a dress!!!). They babble in a supposedly religious tongue that allows them "secret" communication with God, but then a congregate member tells the others what it means and so it's not "secret". Alot of women aren't allowed to work and they have their own schools and competions. They are not for marriage "out of the fold". \n\nBaptist~ Found upon the principals of John the Baptist, aide de camp of Jesus. John used water baptism in his ministries. I do believe God is okay with not doing that if your area is low on water. But his missions were founded upon large meetings and Baptism thereafter. It is based upon the "living water", which is Christ. Like I said, I think you can skate on that if you are in a drought. Also, Baptists have factions. The Free Will Baptists expect you to behave and stess the inherent traits of humans with options. If you misbehave, you repent. The First Baptist groups are just that. They prefer to think of their church is presented to mankind as the group that seeks their Lord just the way John the Baptist did. They were FIRST. Then the Southern Baptists. Everything is an unforgiveable sin unless there is repentance. \n\nMethodist~ An offshoot of the Lutheran Church. Luther got sick of the Catholic Church. He wanted to marry and drink. So, he founded his own group. The Lutheran Churches are founded upon the philosophy of giving and taking in marriage, wine allowed, but they do have altar boys and a Parson in a robe. They also have water baptism. Luther, however, did sin. He was a drunk and a womanizer. But, I am sure he said he was sorry for it and I have no problem with that. Anyway, the Methodists have altar boys, robes but it is more carefree. You can fall in love with anyone and get married. They bowl, shoot pool and drink if they want and all of this is allowed. The Lutherans have synods. The Missouri Synod is the worst. It's like Big Brother. They retain the full capability to run you out of town if  they so choose.	society and culture
What do you think of ISLAMIC SINGLE SEX COMMUNITY LIFESTYLES? Is it healthy? How long could you go without seeing woman?

You are not describing the Islamic communities .\n\nAs you know, you are describing the sick feelings and hatred inside you.\n\nAny one who ever visited an Islamic community knows that men and women work together, learn together and discuss each other normally.

Why do they trace Joseph's bloodline as proof that Jesus was of the house of David and Adam? The Bible spends many words tracing Joseph's bloodline back to David and to Adam.   Considering that Jesus was born of Mary via the Holy Ghost.  Joseph's blood is not in Jesus.  And that creates my question.  If Joseph's blood is not in Jesus then tracing Joseph back to David and to Adam doesn't make Jesus related to David or Adam.  Mary's blood would be in Jesus so tracing her bloodline would seem reasonable.  But The Bible traces Joseph's.  Why? Part of the prophecy of Jesus Christ was that He must be of the lineage of David, "the root of Jesse" (Jesse being the Father of King David.)  Although not a single drop of blood from Joseph flows in the Body of Jesus.  (it's from the Males that the "sinful nature" is passed down) and The mother's blood never mixes with the unborn child. (that's why they have PATERNITY Tests)\n\nThe Lineage of Jesus is prophisied to be from the lineage of Kings.  If you read the Lineage in the Gospel of Matthew It is traditionally known to be that of Joseph, but the Lineage of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke traces the ancestroy of Mary (not Joseph).  So either way you go, the lineage goes back to King David.  Thereby fulfilling the prophecy of His Lineage from both parents.\nThe prophecy of descending from King David and the prophecy of the blood lineage.   \n\nTwo prophecies out of 435 fulfilled with one set of Parents!!!	society and culture

I am looking for detail information about Nowshera district (NWFP) Pakistan. Please send me all about Nowsher?  http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/pakistan/nowshera\nNowshera[edit this] \n\n Nowshera is located to the north of Khushab district, probabally the most populated area in the bigining of northern hill areas. It has many small towns situated all around. Overall it is called as Soon Valley, a beautiful hill station, people like to come from all over pakistan to visit the Sodhi Garden, Narvari Garden, Phulvari Garden. Soon Valley has blessed by two lakes, the Ochali lake and Khabaki lake. In the winter season thousands of birds migrtae from Ciberia which enhances the natural beauty of Soon. During last years the problem of drinking water has grown, also the water of lakes falling down from its original level. The land of Soon is really fertile, it has the ability to cultivate almost all types of Ajnaas. The most popular of all is the Gobhee(Coulieflower) of Soon (mainly from the small town known as Khohrah) which is famous all over in Pakistan. \nIn conclusion this is the most beautiful place of Pakistan where Government sector never invested even a penny. Although Nowshera has a sub Tehsil status but people are demanding to give it the status of Tehsil so that all local governmental administrative structure can be based there. This can become a good vistors place and touristic attraction.	society and culture
Young-earth believers!!?? If the universe is young and it takes millions of years for light to get to us from many stars, how can we see them? Did God create light in transit?

whats the deal with Texas people ? with there frases "dont mess with texas" or "everything is bigger in texas" its just a state Let me tell you of a personal experience.  I am not stereotyping any state neither am I meaning to disrespect anybody.  Just wanted to get that out of the way before I begin.\nI and my husband have traveled the US quite a bit.  When we were in the city of San Angelo, Texas in July 2005 we went camping to a popular camping site.  One day, while strolling past all the recreational vehicles, with noisy people partying everywhere one looks, we saw a unique motorcycle and could not help but inspect closer to admire it.  A couple of minutes later, we hear a young man's voice behind us saying something, we could hear he had a strong local dialect. \n-"The ole' man o'er there, dat's his.  He's ole', but he can shoot real well."\nOne can derive one thing from that statement, he thought we may have wanted to steal or vandalize the motorcycle in some way.  We said we were only admiring it.  Then a conversation began about who's from where and what we are doing here.  Well, my turn came to explain my origins.  Since I am a Ukrainian who has married an American, I told him I was from Ukraine.  He was quiet for a few seconds then replied with a drawl, "So, is that outside of Texas?"  \nI looked at him, then at my husband, and that was when we both decide to say "goodbye" to our "unique" Texan friend.  Never have we had such an experience...only in Texas.	society and culture

Why the people are so cruel to the deaf people?  Ignorance and insecurity.  \n\nUnfortunately, many people in society are uncomfortable around anyone that's different from them.  So whether it's a different race, religion, style of clothing, or differently-abled, most "normal" people reinforce their sense of belonging and "superiority" by putting down those who are different.\n\nMany people also have little to no exposure to those with severe hearing loss, and therefore don't understand the culture, or that most deaf people have normal intelligence.  And be aware that when someone speaks a different language, the communication barrier is intimidating and often frustrating.  \n\nBut please don't think that ALL people are like that.  Especially in a one-on-one interaction, you'll find that most hearing people are kind and even curious enough to want to learn more about you and what your life is like.  But teasing most often occurs when people are in a group (and especially during the teenage years, when "fitting in" is perceived as a high priority).  \n\nBe proud of who you are and prove the ignorant people wrong by living your best life with dignity.

Are we afraid of backlash or are we just a lethargic nation that needs to complain about misfortunes, not fix them?\n-Dan Dan, I really think Americans currently live in fear. Fear of losing their jobs, fear of their credit score falling, and fear of jail and becoming a part of the 'system'.\n\nAt first this sounds like crazy conspiracy theory, but I do not subscribe to conspiracy personally. \n\nI see a war that the people do not support, and no one is marching against it this time (as in Vietnam). I see people being held against their will without charges and no one seems to care (as in Guantanamo Bay). I see employers being allowed to cut the rug out from under the worker (pay, benefits, etc). and yet no one quits or demands unions. \n\nPS, heaven help you if you step up and start to make a stink. I did for racism at my work place and my boss held a meeting and all but laughed in my face. Had to leave that job in the end over the whole matter.\n\nThe best thing I can recommend is educate yourself as much as possible (college and more college, current events, local politics). Vote.

What does our soul look like? Has any one ever seen soul floating to heaven in action? I heard so much about when you die your body become rotten but our soul will stay in tact, does it look similarly to over-easy egg but without becon? As of now, we can not really prove whether they exist or not, but if you are talking about religion, then I would say yes. Religion and Belief is not something you need to prove, if it is proven, it becomes fact, therefore we must believe there is such thing as a soul. Souls probably do not have a shape, as God is all around, yet we can not see him as a solid shape. Like the Bible, God appears as a bright light, burning bush...	society and culture

what do you think of the man of lawlessness?  The man of lawlessness is one who comes to do away with the law. Daniel 7:25 says that he will "try to change times and laws".  This person will probably attempt to replace the Biblical times and holidays, attempting to do away with Pesach (Passover), change the time the day begins from the biblical method of starting at evening (perhaps changing it to "the witching hour").\n\nAnd this person will say the law is done away with. This person will deceive if possible even the elect. Something to watch for.	society and culture

Why do so many athiests, agnostics, pagans, and other assorted scoffers show up on the religion thread? Just curious. I know that I have written several responses to this question. However, I now have too many answers to sort through and find the ones I'm thinking of. (New features needed!)\n\nSo, I'll start from scratch.\n\nFirst of all, I resent being lumped in with "assorted scoffers." I believe that I have been nothing but curteous to the people of faith here. I openly deny their belief-system. They openly deny mine. That's fine. We have, however, engaged in some very respectful debate, much to the benefit (I hope) of both sides. I know that my beliefs have not changed, but my preconceptions about young-Earth Christians have been shattered by some of the people I have found here. I think that they are wrong, but I am thrilled to have the opportunity to debate with them without resorting to name-calling or rudeness.\n\nGranted, this requires an openness on both our parts. I think that their faith is "wrong." They think that my lack of faith is "wrong." This is where most people get hung up and debate can go no further. If someone disagreeing with you is "offensive," you're stuck. Once you accept this disagreement, you are quite free to exchange ideas. This is what I have found here (for the most part.)\n\nAs for why I spend so much time in the religion and spirituality forum, I see faith as playing a huge role in the lives of everyone in the world, be they moderate Muslims, fundamentalist Christians, Pagans, or Atheists like myself.\n\nIn my supposedly free country I see gays discriminated against due to faith. People who would never think of using the N-word openly hate and criticize homosexuals for what they are, not who they are. \n\nI see medical advances that could help millions of people stymied by arguments that have their basis in faith. Stem cell research could potentially ease the suffering of billions around the globe, but people of faith stand in the way.\n\nWe are currently involved in what may or may not be a holy war. This is an issue of faith.\n\nOur current government supports "faith-based initiatives" in what may be a breach of The Constitution itself.\n\nI know that faith helps people sleep at night. This doesn't undo the tremendous amount of suffering it has inflicted at every turn of history. \n\nI see faith as a problem, and would like to encourage people to put aside their myths and embrace reason. However, I realize that this is futile. As Jonathan Swift said, "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."\n\nThat said, I think that Yahoo Answers provides a wonderful opportunity to try to see where other people are coming from. I disagree with the Christians (and Muslims and Pagans...), but I think it is very important for me to try to understand them. I would hope that they will try to understand me. Once we find some common ground and some mutual respect, we can truly start to talk about things.\n\nI hate the name-calling. The largest problem I have with religion is that it is divisive. I feel that this is the most important aspect of faith that needs to be removed from the equation. Name-calling is also divisive and does not fit into my attempts to act reasonably.\n\nI feel that I deny, but do not scoff. I embrace and enjoy open debate. I think that the things discussed here are important. I'd like to think that some of the things I have to say are pertinent. \n\nIf you want a place for only Christians (for example) to exchange ideas, there are plenty of places on the web for that. However, I think that this exclusion of other mindsets and worldviews does a disservice to those who would seek such a closed system.\n\nThat's why, as an atheist, I show up on the religion thread.	society and culture
How about we replace the word "believe" with the word "think", I think God does /does not exist? It is the finality of "I believe" that grates on my nerves, "I believe" is a self-hynotic sort of term and it prevents any further thought or discussion, stop using it and say "I Think" ask yourself "What do I think" not "What do I believe" and you might really think of some answers. how about you let people use their own choice of words. thats what I believe.	society and culture

Then you inject drops of caramel into the cups and put the bottom layer of chocolate on. When the bottom layer cools, it naturally becomes a solid chocolate bar.\n\nIt's not that hard to know.	society and culture

Who was Jesus is referencing in the Mark chapter 2? Did the word of God make a mistake? 25He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? 26In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."\n\nI Samuel  1 David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?" \n 2 David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me, 'No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 3 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find." \n\n 4 But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread hereâprovided the men have kept themselves from women." \n\nDid the word of God make a mistake? in answer to your question!!! i believe that yes god made a mistake but noone will admit it i believe he made the mitake in 74!! xxxxx	society and culture
Snark - what does it mean? Snark, is a derivative word from snarky, "Irritable or short-tempered; irascible" from Dutch and Low German snorken, of imitative origin.\n\nSome claim that it is a portmanteau of the phrase "snide remark", refers to a belittling or sarcastic style of speech or writing. It could loosely be described as irritable, backhanded or "snidely derisive"; hence, 'snarkish', 'snarky', 'to snark at somebody'. It does not necessarily have negative connotations and can be used humorously.\n\nThis word has Germanic origins and is etymologically unrelated to the imaginary creature in Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark.\n\nSnark is also often used in fandom to describe a character's/writer's comment, action, way of acting/ writing style.\n\nExample:\n\nJane: That comment made by Sydney Bristow was snarky! \nJimmy: Thank god for J.J. Abram's writing genius. Snarky is a great word, isn't it? Thanks, Jesus!	society and culture
which is the best way to delay ejaculation?  1) Stop doing whatever it is you're doing.  No, I'm not kidding!  If you feel yourself on the brink but want to continue going, then stop whatever stimulus is keeping you on edge and focus on your lover.  It's perfectly fine to let him/her know what you're doing- especially since they'll get all the pleasure as you wait for the urgency to drop a bit.  When you're back in control, get back in the game!  Partners who do the waiting trade-off (I'll do you, you do me while I rest, now switch) can have very long, pleasurable sessions, and, what's more, postponing climax can make it all the more intense when it happens.\n\n2) Devise some mental methods for yourself.  When the time comes, think about nonsexy things.  Think about them hard.  I've heard that some men picture aborted babies and massacres, but that's going a little too far, in my mind- all you need is an image that won't totally kill your libido, but does slow it down- maybe it's grandma, sitting on the toilet, or Rosie O'Donnell, naked . . . I don't know.  Try different things and see what happens.\n\n3) You can always grab tightly around the base of your shaft- and when I say tight, I mean tight- this has often been said to calm imminent warnings of ejaculation, although it's by no means foolproof, and might excite you more, or simply not be strong enough to stem the tide, so to speak.  This is the same idea behind c*ck rings, which you might want to try, as they also act somewhat as a preventative for ejaculation- but again, they won't stop it completely.  Give it a try and see if it helps.  You can also, if you're doing something where you can stop for a moment and slow down- try tugging your testicles down, which, if the handling doesn't set you off, will help rewind the clock on your erection's longevity, so to speak.\n\n4) This is a method you'd need to do beforehand, but you can always decrease the sensitivity of your penis.  The ways to do this, however, generally increase altering a condom in a way that isn't safe; it will reduce the effectiveness of the condoms, so only do it if you know you aren't at risk of pregnancy or disease.  If not, you can try buying numbing cremes for your penis, which you would put directly on your erection, with a condom over (you need the condom because otherwise, your lover will get numb, too- no fun for them).  This will help you last.  You can also try 'double wrapping' your erection in two condoms, or one very thick version, to keep sensitivity down so that you won't be so affected.\n\n5) And last but not least, just go ahead and do it.  Let loose, because sex shouldn't be an awful, grueling struggle to keep from having the best pleasure of your life.  Go ahead, ejaculate, but if it's too soon for you or your partner's liking, just know that your climax doesn't mean he/she doesn't get theirs!  Keep a spare dildo/strap-on (a lot of men wear strap-ons over their flaccid penises) in the bottom drawer for moments like this, or just use your fingers, hands, and mouth to finish off your lover, too.\n\nHope these help you!	society and culture

You know the christian martyrs..? when they were being killed did it hurt them..?? ....? I mean if "God"  were true..does it say some where in the Bible or something about if martyrs will feel any pain..or something like that..?\n\nI'm just wondering..I'm an atheist & I don't want to be a crisitian..i'm just curious.... Peter, as well as some of the other disciples, were crucified. No death could be more painful. Mark was tied between 4 horses and pulled in 4 pieces(or at least that's what some historians say). That's got to hurt a little. Polycarp was burned at the stake. Paul was beheaded not to mention that he was scourged 5 times, beaten with rods 4 times, stoned and many other persecutions while he was alive. The early disciples were persecuted their whole lives and then martyred in the most cruel way. That's why I believe the bible. These men were eyewitnesses of everything they wrote about in the bible and they lived a persecuted life and died horribly and went to their death saying that everything they had said was true when they could have lived a peaceful life and died peacefully if they would just have renounced everything they wrote about. But they didn't. They went to their death saying it was true.	society and culture
Who really believes that Alexander the Great was really Bi-Sexual? I'm still a little "iffy" about that. Does anyone have any great literature that proofs he swung the other way? It's fairly well-established that he had a male lover.  It really wasn't uncommon in those days.  In ancient Greece, older men often wooed a younger man.  The men would teach the youths wisdom and how to conduct themselves properly in society, and they would get some play for their troubles.  Read Plato's _Symposium_.  It's pretty awesome.  These guys all got drunk and started talking about love, and there was a speech or two claiming that the love between two men (and they don't mean chaste, platonic love) was higher than that between a man and a woman, because it was between equals.	society and culture

who has really rebellious children(of any age) what measures do you take to try and control their behaviour? i don't have any children but it just seems that todays kids are just taking the p*** cos they know they can get away\nwith anything. have you got any good ideas to keep them from becoming complete and utter 'criminals' All children are rebellious to a degree. I think that most parent's concerns are that if they discipline their children then their children won't love them, or end up doing something worse than what they are already doing.  Then of course there is the threat of what our society condones as discipline as being taken for flat out abuse.\n\nWhat I have learned, and I have two that are very rebellious, 13 years apart, one is grown and one is hitting puberty, that using a system of Love and Logic works everytime on every kid.\n\nWhat this means is that you have to learn to separate yourself from your children's emotions.  Give them choices and if they do not abide by those choices then they suffer the consequences, be that they owe you time, a chore, or a time out, whatever.  This teaches them that they are fully responsible for their actions and will learn to think before they act or react.	society and culture

what kinda girls do guys find hot? hot - now how do you define it? physical and beyond ;) and how's the hottest girl you know like? "Hotness" is very subjective. Every person's tastes differ. Personally, I've always had a bit of a thing for redheads and Asians, but I've been completely struck by a couple women who didn't fall into either category, so easily. Physically, every man can debate whatever physical trait they find aesthetically pleasing, but I think that there's one personality trait that's universal: CONFIDENCE.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing sexier than a truly confident, self-assured woman. One of my ex-girlfriends I dated for three years, and I loved her, but she was so cripplingly, self-deprecating, that it truly ruined our relationship. You can only compliment someone and assure them so many times before you let their negativity destroy you. Apparantly three years was pretty much my limit, and I'll never make that mistake again.

You should have just stayed around after Mass and asked these questions to the priest. You likely received both the body and the blood of Christ at the same time, rather than separately. There are many more details to share. For more, post your questions at www.askmeaboutgod.org and receive a free, private, complete, personalized answer via email in about one day.

Are all human cultures inferior to global capitalism?  Is global capitalism the post-modern Tower of Babel?  Yes we are merely tools and commodities. Don't for one second think that capitalism empowers anyone. It turns everyone and everything into capital. \nWell, supposedly god struck down the Tower as a warning against anyone trying to reach up to his level.\nI think a closer analogy would be Icarus getting too high up thinking he's so great and having his wings melt and fall apart. Capitalism will collapse on itself eventually.	society and culture
How is asking what "God" does with his left hand perverted? The Bible talks about his right hand all the time but never talks about his left hand.  I just wanted to know what it does. You and I both know the answer to this. It's not perverted. \n\nIt's that you're questioning them about their god in a way they've never been questioned about before, nor have questioned themselves. It's like when I ask them if they thought God watched porn!\n\nThe reactions you're getting are because you're getting them to THINK (and I imagine that hurts them, like sunlight does a vampire). Of course there are implications floating around about WHAT "He" does with his other divine hand while the right hand is busy ruling the universe...\n\nPersonally, I think he keeps it busy while he's watching porn.	society and culture

I can roller skate very well, would I be able to ice skate easily?  There are some things that will come easily to you because you can roller skate, and others that will be hard. Stopping is different, of course, as is spinning and some of the jumps. But your experience roller skating will definately help you. \n\nOne girl at my rink skates beautifully. She started about a year ago, on ice, but she'd done years on roller skates beforehand. \n\nYou should also know that Tara Lipinsky, Olympic gold medallist in figure skating, started as a roller skater. In addition, a lot of (in fact, most of) the people on the US Olympic team in speed skating are former inline-skaters. So the skills do transfer, to a certain extent.	sports

If the top 16 teams in the BCS played in a playoff, this is what it would look like:? 1) Ohio St. v 16) Tennessee\n2) USC v 15) West Virginia\n3) Michigan v 14) Virginia Tech\n4) Florida v 13) Rutgers\n5) LSU v 12) Oklahoma\n6) Louisville v 11) Auburn\n7) Wisconsin v 10) Notre Dame\n8) Boise St. v 9) Arkansas\n\nAssuming that the bracket played out similar to an NCAA Basketball bracket, who do you think would win the "national title" at the end of the playoff?\n\nI see it like this:\n1) Ohio St. v 9) Arkansas\n2) USC v 7) Wisconsin\n3) Michigan v 11) Auburn\n4) Florida v 12) Oklahoma\n\nRound 3:\n1) Ohio St. v 4) Florida\n2) USC v 3) Michigan\n\nFinals\n1) Ohio St. v 2) USC\n\nI think the same two teams would play, but with much less controversy.  Your opinions? I think playoffs are definetely the answer, but i'd go with 8 teams and only 3 rounds total. \n1) Ohio St. v 8) Boise St\n2) USC v 7) Wisconsin \n3) Michigan v 6) Louisville\n4) Florida v 5) LSU\n\nthen\n1) Ohio St v 4) Florida\n2) USC v 3) Michigan\n\nThen Final\n\nOhio St vs USC\n\nI don't actually think it would play out exactly as ranked, but i just used their rankings as a guideline. The point isn't who would be in the final game, but rather that there is no doubt that the real top 2 teams are in the top 8 and this way they would have a chance to really prove their worth.	sports
When was cricket game first originated?  A basic form of the sport can be traced back to the 13th century, but it may have existed even earlier than that. The game seems to have originated among shepherds and farm workers in the Weald between Kent and Sussex. Written evidence exists of a sport known as creag being played by Prince Edward, the son of Edward I (Longshanks), at Newenden, Kent in 1300.\n\nIn 1598, a court case referred to a sport called Creckett being played at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford around 1550. The Oxford English Dictionary gives this as the first recorded instance of cricket in the English language.	sports

I can't really try my orthotics at the store because I can't find any shoes where the insoles come out so it's always a crapshoot on if the shoes will fit once I rip the insoles out.  I have always worked well with adidas sambas for indoor and whatever kind I had for outdoor so I know they tend to fit well.  Please help.  I need to get back out there without pain!!

Should a snowboard be completely flat against the ground when laid down? I'm still a beginner and I bought my first board.  When I lay the board on flat ground it kind of bows in the middle (the toe and heel touch the ground but not the middle).  Is this okay and how will this affect my riding?

According to wikipedia: "In skiing, the curvature in the base of a ski."\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski\n\nBasically it's built on the premise that once you step onto the board, then by virtue of your body weight, you are guaranteed to have the entire board touching the snow.

But when the people sitting at top have no respect of our expectations, then what we can do. They are just happy with the politics. So there is no point in disussing this. And as far as world cup is concerned then forget @ India. It will be great if they could go ahead from  even league matches. So now just stop supporting the team. This is my request to all of u. \nJust wasting 9 precious hours in watching India's match is foolishness now. Its @ wasting almost 600 hours (that is, more than 25 days) per year, if india plays 45-50 days cricket in an year !!!!  Its difficult to stop ourselves but we need to do this, becoz there are many more important things in our life... Forget Chappel, Forget Dravid, Forget Ganguly.... and Forget Indian team... if u just remembers cricket any day then just watch highlight of Sachin's inning against Aussie at Sarjah of 1998.

Also what addvice do you have to me. listen up kiddo cuz i know what im talking about.\n\nFirst off, there are two good beginer's boards. Zero, which is my personal favorite, and Alien Workshop, which I've heard a lot of good things about. Alien Workshops are over all good boards, and zero is good for street skating and getting high ollies. \n\nThe next thing, is trucks. I think that the top trucks brands are Krux, Grind King, and Phantom 2. But really, all the trucks are virtually the same.\n\nYou can ask anyone, Zero Black Widdow Bearings are the best.... \n\nSpitfire wheels are the best wheels...\n\nStay away from brands like Blind [which cracks easily] and Birdhouse [They are designed for vert skating, and are VERY VERY hard to ollie with because they are really heavy.] Also element are generally cheap and flimsy. \n\nShoes are all the same, just pick whatever looks good. ^__^\n\nIf you already know how to ollie, thats great [Push down with your backfoot on the tail of the board, and slide your front foot up the board and jump]. But it takes a while to ollie, so you really need to keep practicing as much as possible [It took me around 2 months to finally ollie], and watch as many skate videos. If you follow those two things, you will be ollie-ing in no time. \n\ngood luck.	sports

If the SF 49ers and Houston Texans end up with the same record, who gets the 1st pick? If the SF 49ers and Houston Texans end up with the same record, who gets the 1st pick? I heard if their records end up the same, then the first tie-breaker is easiest schedule. In this case Houston would get the 1st pick since Houston has an easier schedule. Or is it the head-to-head matchup that determines the tie-break? So if Houston beats the 49ers in the regular season finale, and both teams end up with the same record, the 49ers would get the first pick. So which is it? Or is there another tie-breaker scenario that takes precedence? â¢ Strength of schedule for the previous season is the first tie-breaker for teams with the same winning percentage.	sports

When was the first .410 gauge shotgun made?  The genesis of the .410 does not coincide with the heyday of shotgun design, which occurred from circa 1850 to 1870. It wasn't until about 1900 that the cartridge is making its appearance in catalogs and the proof houses of England. No one today knows who invented it. There is a good amount of speculation that the .410 was originally a rifle caliber, the .444 Marlin. This is probably so, due to the rather recent discovery of older "rook rifles" that were originally rifles that were converted to shotgun use.	sports

Bleach is the only thing that will kill the mold/mildew and if you don't kill the mold/mildew it will spread.

I need info on the 2 deaths at Talladega Speedway this week?  TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Two NASCAR fans were electrocuted in a campground outside Talladega Superspeedway when a flagpole they were erecting touched power lines. \n\nDonny Lynn Wright, 42, of Remlap and Keith Alan Stell, 39, of Birmingham died Monday, said track spokeswoman Kristi King. Talladega County Coroner Jerry Castleberry pronounced them dead at the scene.\n\nThe Aaron's 499 race will be run at the track on Sunday. Fans commonly use poles to fly flags touting their favorite driver.\n\nWitnesses said Wright and Stell were attempting to anchor a flagpole when it was caught by wind and pushed into power lines running along a road outside the track.\n\n"They were trying to pull the flagpole back off the lines," said James Snider, who was sitting about 30 yards away from the victims' camp site. "I heard a loud pop that sounded like a firecracker, and I went running because the power lines fell. They were both lying on the ground, and two women were trying to get them away from the wires."	sports

But since the NHL has most of its teams located in the eastern United States, some cities like Detroit, Chicago and Columbus have to be put out west.	sports

I would like to know,what size a soccer court have. And does every court have to have the same size?  The length of the field (pitch) should be in the range 90-120m (100-130 yards) and the width should be in the range 45-90m (50-100 yards). Anything that falls within those limits is acceptable.\n\nThe only other requirement is that the pitch must be rectangular, meaning it can't be 90 X 90.\n\nSo all fields are (literally) not created equal. I think there's been an effort at standardizing the new fields at 100m (long) X 80m (wide) but I can't give you any more details on that.	sports

Does anybody know if Umberger was hurt by the hit that Brian Campbel gave him? that was the best hit i have ever seen by the way. Is a Flyers fan and that was an awesome hit on Umberger.  Though I really hope then get the BS out of the way so they can play the game and not have something cheap happen.  I say let Campbell and Brashear drop the gloves get it over with and play the game the last thing either team needs is for someone to do something cheap and hurt someone else.  This way the Flyer get there revenge and everyone is happy.  \n Update: Umberger learned a lesson about skating with his head down in Game 1 of the playoff series with the Buffalo Sabres, getting clocked by defenseman Brian Campbell in the first overtime, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. \nRecommendation: "I was in the right position. I probably should not have gotten the pass," Umberger said Sunday. "... Everybody says maybe I should have had my head up." He remains questionable for Monday night's game, although he says he is fine. Coach Ken Hitchcock seemed optimistic, saying Umberger's only symptom was stiffness in his neck.	sports

who is Azumah Nelson?  Azumah Nelson (born September 19, 1958) is a former boxer who was a three time world champion. A native of Ghana, Nelson is not a prince: He is not related to the Ashanti royal family. He is from a different tribe. He is from the Ga tribe. He used to wear a crown into the ring before his boxing fights.\n\nNelson also has endured personal loss: His wife of many years died during the 1990s of cancer.\n\nNelson's professional boxing debut, in 1979, did not cause much furor, except in Ghana, where he was known because of his family ties. Internationally, Nelson lacked the recognition for such an event to be given its due importance. With the years, however, all of that changed because he garnered world wide fame as a boxer.\n\nHe beat Billy Kwame in Accra by a decision in eight to mark his professional debut. In his third fight, he fought on March 3 of 1980, he knocked out Henry Sadler in the ninth round to win Ghana's regional 126 pound title. On December 13 of that year, he knocked out Joe Skipper in round 10 to add the African continent's belt to his Ghanian regional championship.\n\n1981 was a productive year for the young fighter. He beat Bozzou Aziza in his first fight abroad; held in Togo, and then he beat Miguel Ruiz in his first United States fight, held in California. He added the British commonwealth's Featherweight title with a five round knockout of Brian Roberts.\n\nDespite all his early achievements and being undefeated in 13 fights, Nelson was virtually unknown outside Ghana. Because of this, he was a decisive underdog when he challenged WBC world Featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez on June 21 of 1982 at the Madison Square Garden in New York. Despite losing that fight by a knockout in round 15, Nelson's stock as a boxer rose after that fight, and he established himself as a deserving leading contender in the eyes of many fans. Sanchez sadly passed away almost two months after this fight, suffering a car accident in Mexico City. Sanchez-Nelson was Salvador Sanchez's last fight.\n\nIn his next fight, Nelson knocked out fringe contender Irving Mitchell in eight rounds.\n\nNelson won all four of his fights in 1983, and he began 1984 by beating Hector Cortez by decision on March 9 in Las Vegas. Then, on December 8 of that year, he became boxing royalty by knocking out Wilfredo Gomez in round 11 to win the WBC world Featherweight championship. Behind on the three judges' scorecards, Nelson rallied in that last round to become champion in Puerto Rico.\n\nNelson held on to that title for three years. He could not fight for 9 months after the Gomez bout, but when he returned, he retained the title in Miami with a fifth round knockout of Juvenal Ordenes in September 1985, and then in October of that year, he retained it again with a first round knockout of Pat Cowdell in Birmingham, England. The Cowdell knockout in particular became a highlight film material: Cowdell was left frozen on the canvas by Nelson's knockout punch.\n\nIn 1986, he retained the title two times, beating future world champion Marcos Villasana and former Barry McGuigan challenger Danilo Cabrera (once again, in Puerto Rico).\n\nIn 1987, Nelson retained the title against Mauro Guitierrez, by a knockout in round six, and in a rematch with Villasana, once again, by decision. After the second fight with Villasana, Nelson abandoned the WBC's World Featherweight title.\n\nNelson began 1988 by fighting former Julio Cesar Chavez rival Mario Martinez for the vacant WBC's world Jr. Lightweight title. He beat Martinez by decision in 12 rounds on February 29 at Los Angeles to become world Jr. Lightweight champion, and then he defended the title with a knockout in round nine against former world champ Lupe Suarez and with a knockout in three over Sydney Del Rovere.\n\nHe proceeded in 1989 by beating Martinez in a rematch, by knockout in round 12, and then fighting Jim McDonnell, with exactly the same result.

What is the best wetsuit on the market for surfing in southern california in the winter?  These days, it's tough to go wrong.\n\nJust to start out with some perspective, during the winter in Southern California the water gets down to the mid to high 50's. Sometimes it'll pop back up to the low 60's for a few days. Other days it'll drop down to the low 50's. \n\nAnd since (as you well know) water temps are controlled by currents and ocean swells, even in the summer it can get pretty chilly.\n\nSo, with that said, here are my suggestions:\n\nFor the winter months, get yourself a good 2/3 fullsuit (most surfing wetsuits are a different thickness in the arms/legs than in the torso, the logic being that your arms and legs need more flexibility). A 2/3 has 2mm thick arms/legs and 3mm thick torso. \n\nThe best fullsuits on the market are widely considered to be the Rip Curl "Bomb" series and the O'Neill "Psycho" series. Xcel, Hotline, Hurley, Quiksilver and Billabong all make good suits, but 80% of the guys in the water here wear Rip Curl or O'Neill.  \n\nThe Rip Curl "Bomb" series comes in two versions - the "E-Bomb" and the "F-Bomb". They're basically identical suits except that the F-Bomb is coated inside the torso section with this fuzzy insulation stuff, which supposedly keeps your mid-section a bit warmer. The E-Bomb doesn't have the coating and is 100% pure "Elastomax", which is this super squishy, stretchy neopreme. \n\nRight now I'm using a 2/3 E-Bomb. I find it to be astonishingly warm. However, I also have a 2/3 O'Neill Psycho II. It's made of an almost identical super stretchy material. \n\n6 months ago I would have suggested the O'Neill over the Rip Curl because they always seemed to be better constructed (the Rip Curls have always been more flexible, but had a tendency to start falling apart after a few months). However, with this new E-Bomb, I stand corrected. It's just as sturdy as the Psycho II. Maybe even better. \n\nOne more factor to consider is the fit. I've always found O'Neill wetsuits to be a bit tighter fitting than the Rip Curl. Then again, I'm on the bigger side (at least as far as surfers go). While you want your suit to be as snug and form-fitting as possible, a few wrinkles here and there can sometimes equal a bit of extra free movement.  \n\nAgain though, I'm nit-picking. Bottom line:\n\n2/3 O'Neill Psycho II\n2/3 Rip Curl F-Bomb\n\nYou can't go wrong with either one. If you get cold easily, go up one thickness. OR, just pick up some booties for those really cold mornings. \n\nCheck out the Rip Curl store in San Clemente or check out Jack's Surfboards in Huntington Beach. Both have a MASSIVE selection of suits. Or just order online. \n\nQuick note: If you plan on surfing in the Fall/Spring, your 2/3 fullsuit will still work beautifully and keep you extra warm. \n\nBUT, if you have the extra cash and like the idea of shedding a little rubber when the conditions warm up, get a short-sleeved "comp" (used to stand for "competition wetsuit" back when they inroduced them in the 80's). The only drawback to the comp is that you can get a nasty farmer's tan on your arms. Another option is a long-sleeve springsuit or short-arm springsuit.\n\nFor the summer, get a thin wetsuit top to wear with your boardshorts. Keeps you warmer than a rashguard and keeps you from having to find someone to smear sunblock on your back.\n\nProbably more information that you wanted, but there's a LOT to choose from and the conditions can vary quite a bit. But with the links below, I think you'll be all set. \n\nSee you in the water!	sports
i just purchased a Remington 710 and am in need of a scope. any reccomendations? my budget is 125$ or less, tx looking for a scope to fit this model, something that is strong, durable and provides me with visual distance Forget Tasco!!  I have a Nikon on my Browning A-bolt and it is just fine.  I normally prefer Leupold, but I got the Nikon with a rebate and on sale.  I think unless you really shop around, your going to have a hard time finding a dependable scope to take the punishment for $125.  Learn to shoot your iron sights well and wait until after the season for some sales.	sports

Should Bill Cowher get Fired?  While the Steelers are playing below their potential, and a lot of that can be blamed on the coach, you absolutely can't fire Cowher.  Think of what he's done long term, playoff appearances, division titiles, Super Bowls.  The man clearly knows how to run a football team (even if that hasn't been clear this year) and is entitiled to continue coaching because of what he has done and can contiue to bring to the franchise.  He's better than anyone that would replace him anyways.  Why would anyone, especially someone as classy and loyal as Rooney, fire someone so accomplished just because of one unfortunate year?  If you want to blame someone, blame the offense and special teams for turning the ball over so much.  That's the real reason we're 2-5 and not 4-3 or 5-2.\n\n\nBesides, he's going to retire in a year or two anyway.	sports
