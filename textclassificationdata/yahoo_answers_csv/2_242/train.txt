In Excel, How do i sort data in alphabetical order, is there a formula for this. if so, what is it? Please help me out. Thanks  a heap in advance. 10 points for first right answer The A to Z button answers are correct, but you typically do not need to select your range to sort. Excel will expand to all the contiguous columns and rows. \n\nThen only time you need to select your range to sort is if either an entire or row or column is empty in the middle of your range.\n\nObviously if you are sorting only one column in the middle of other data and do not want the other columns to sort along with it you need to just select the data in that column. The sort button will ask you if you want to expand the selection.	computers and internet

my mic doesnt wanna work. i pluged i in the mic jack and nothing happenes when i speak into it.who can help me  Some of these may sound stupid and you may have tried them. It is, however, good to go through the basics all over again.\n-Check if the microphone jack is inserted in the correct socket. There is a colour code (usually pink for microphones) which is followed by all manufacturers.\n-Check if the sound software (accompanied with the mainboard drivers) has an option to configure the microphone. It has a feature which can detect if microphone is transmitting any signals to the computer.\n-If you can't find it, double click the sound icon in your taskbar and go to recording section in advanced controls. Check if the microphone is selected (default) as the recording device and the either the microphone or the master is in mute position.\n-Check the microphone on a system on which any other microphone is functional.	computers and internet

What would make a phoneline dedicated for dial-up internet access dial 911 on its own?  there are some Trojan horses that will cause this. Also, some dialers that install themselves when you visit disreputable porn sites will dial weird numbers, including some that start with 911, without your knowledge. \n\nIf you are having this issue and you use broadband, I would suggest disconnecting your telephone cable from the computer. If you use dial up, I would suggest getting the computer cleaned by a professional and avoiding using IE to surf the web. It is easier to install software without your knowledge if you use it.	computers and internet

I am writing a persuasive essay against performance-enhancing drugs in sports.any opinions?any sports included  Steroids seem to be the easy way out. Working out at the gym is hard work, and some players are so lazy, they want to do it the easy way. Barry Bonds--and probably plenty of other athletes--could have been respected, great athletes if they had been willing to work. But they just took steroids. Athletes like Barry Bonds, Mark Mcquire (sp?), Rafael Palmiero--they all broke huge records. People celebrated--until they found out the horrible truth. It caused so much confusion in baseball. What to do with them? Did they have to put asterisks by all the records? (715*\n*used steroids)\nI mean, that just gives kids bad ideas. Steroids\na) RECK your body\n2) injure your chances of being a respected athlete\nd) are just plain cheap\nMost of those athletes are liars, too! They say that they didn't intentionally take steroids. That's why I respect Jason Giambi--he admitted his mistake.\nI saw a story on the news about a high school football player who died. He had been taking steroids and they recked his body.	sports

Prozac?????? I've just started taking prozac four days ago, I know it'll be a few weeks before I feel any effect, but I want to know if anyone has suffered from any side effects while taking it. Since I've started I've had moderate pains in my stomach and sides but nothing too bad. Also will I need to take any vitiman supplements with it like you do when you take an anti-biotic? What you're experiencing are typical side effects to SSRI's - All psychotropic drugs come with side effects and they should go away in a week or two.  As per the effect, you'll feel it full blast in about a month, maybe even two, with any SSRI.  You're essentially changing the chemical response to serotonin production in your brain.  Once the reuptake inhibitors kick in, you will feel very different, but it takes a little while so be patient.  You sound really open minded to taking meds and I think that's great!\n\nHere's some info written by this crazy dude who knows everything about psychotropic drugs.  \n\nProzac's pros and cons:\nPros: Prozac's long half-life makes the issue of med compliance a little less of a big deal, hence the approval for depressed teenagers. It also has studies backing it up for PMDD, by Lilly and independent researchers, including the Amen clinic, where I'm treated. You can see at the Amen Clinic's case studies in practice the more common form of PMDD that responds to SSRIs will respond to whichever SSRI you get along with the best. Prozac Weekly does have an advantage for certain forms of PMDD.\n\n \n\nCons: That really long half-life means it takes forever to wean yourself off of  Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) to avoid SSRI discontinuation syndrome.  But only if the discontinuation syndrome hits you hard, which is fairly uncommon with Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride).  In fact some more enlightened doctors will prescribe the liquid form to help wean patients off of other SSRIs and Effexor (venlafaxine). The sexual side effects, though, are pretty bad.  For being the weakest of the SSRIs the side effects are pretty gnarly.\n\nProzac's side effects:\n\nTypical Side Effects: The usual for SSRIs - headache, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, sleepiness or insomnia, and diarrhea or constipation, weight gain, loss of libido. Most everything but the weight gain and loss of libido usually goes away within a couple of weeks. With Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) it's a coin toss as to losing or gaining weight. Sometimes it will just kill your appetite.\n\nNot So Common Side Effects: Rash, 'flu-like symptoms, anger/rage.\n These may or may not happen to you don't, so don't be surprised one way or the other.\n\n \n\nFreaky Rare Side Effects: Bleeding gums, amnesia, anti-social reaction (oh, come on, like we're not anti-social already), herpes (again, blaming the med for an STD), excessive hair growth, engorged breasts, involuntary tongue protrusion (in one 77-year-old woman who stopped sticking her tongue out at everyone after they stopped giving her Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride)).\n\nYou aren't going to get these. I promise.\n\nInteresting Stuff Your Doctor Probably Won't Tell You: Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) has been found to make a lot of other drugs work better. Great, huh? Not always, as with some meds it can be to the point of overdose. But it was that effect that lead to the breakthrough of the antipsychotic & antidepressant cocktail to treat bipolar depression. Anyway, Tegretol (carbamazepine) could suddenly get toxic on you and Xanax (alprazolam) could knock you out if you add Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) to them, or add them to Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride), so be careful and always check your drug-drug interactions! A big part of this is the usual pharmacokinetic stuff of liver enzymes being able to deal with only so much, and Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) gives your liver a bit of a workout.  But that doesn't explain the entire effect of all of the drug-drug interactions.  There's some pharmacodynamic (how meds work in your brain) stuff going on as well.\nProzac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) isn't such a hot idea for anyone with diabetes, and not because of potential weight gain, rather it messes with your glycemic control.\n\n \n\nProzac's Dosage and How to Take Prozac: I'm just going 	health

Harmful effects.....? Does anybody know any harmful health effects of using Turmeric excessively? Turmeric is a spice used in Indian food and i read a lot of health benefits of using it but could not find a single site which talks about harmful effects, if used excessively.

is it safe to masturbate everyday ?  Masturbation is common in both males and females, but more so in males. The frequency depends on the individual but also by the opportunity. Many boys even masturbate in the restrooms at school. It is not good or bad, it is normal. Some boys can masturbate 8 to 10 times a day. High strung people tend to masturbate more frequently and strangely, less intelligent people tend to masturbate less frequently. Some people can masturbate without lubricant, others use soap, oils, or Vaseline but caution is needed to prevent irritation. Does it do any psychological harm? No, it is a normal part of development and as men age, those over 40 years often masturbate to obtain sexual gratification as their partner is unwilling, or the vaginal tissue is too flaccid to obtain ejaculation. The normal amount of ejaculate is about 5 ccs but varies with frequency	health
Alzheimers? What are some of the symptoms, treatment, and what is the life expectancy of someone who suffers from Alzheimers? Alzheimer Disease Symptoms\nAlzheimer disease begins with a mild, slowly worsening memory loss. Many older people fear that they have Alzheimer disease because they can’t find their eyeglasses or remember someone’s name. \n\n\nThese very common problems are most often due to a much less serious condition involving slowing of mental processes with age. \n\n\nMedical professionals call some of these cases benign senescent forgetfulness, age-related memory loss, or minimal cognitive impairment. \n\n\nWhile these conditions are a nuisance, they do not significantly impair a person’s ability to learn new information, solve problems, or carry out everyday activities, as Alzheimer disease does. \n Early warning signs of Alzheimer disease include memory problems such as the following: \n\nDifficulty recognizing familiar people or things (not just forgetting a name) \n\n\nTrouble remembering recent events or activities \n\n\nInability to solve simple arithmetic problems \n\n\nProblems finding the right word for a familiar thing \n\n\nDifficulty performing familiar tasks \nAs the disease progresses, however, the symptoms become more serious. They may include the following: \n\nInability to carry out everyday activities, often called activities of daily living, without help - Bathing, dressing, grooming, feeding, using the toilet \n\n\nInability to think clearly or solve problems \n\n\nDifficulties understanding or learning new information \n\n\nProblems with communication - Speaking, reading, writing \n\n\nIncreasing disorientation and confusion even in familiar surroundings \n\n\nGreater risk of falls and accidents due to poor judgment and confusion \n In the later stages of the disease, the symptoms are severe and devastating: \n\nComplete loss of short- and long-term memory – May be unable to recognize even close relatives and friends \n\n\nComplete dependence on others for activities of daily living \n\n\nSevere disorientation – May walk away from home and get lost \n\n\nBehavior or personality changes – May become anxious, hostile, or aggressive \n\n\nLoss of mobility – May be unable to walk or move from place to place without help \n\n\nImpairment of other movements such as swallowing – Increases risk of malnutrition, choking, and aspiration (inhaling foods and beverages, saliva, or mucus into lungs) \nThese symptoms typically develop over a period of years. The disease progresses at different rates in different people. \n  \nEmotional problems such as depression and anxiety are common in older people. These problems can leave elderly people feeling confused or forgetful. Because these emotional problems are reversible in many people, it is important that they be distinguished from Alzheimer disease and other brain disorders. \n\nAlzheimer Disease Treatment\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. Treatment focuses on relieving and slowing down the progress of the symptoms, behavior changes, and complications. \n \nAn individual with AD should always be under medical care. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual’s health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with AD. Treatment most often consists of medications and nondrug treatments such as behavior therapy.\n\n\nSelf-Care at Home\nMany individuals with Alzheimer disease in the early and intermediate stages are able to live independently. \n\n\nWith regular checks by a local relative or friend, they are able to live for some time without constant supervision. \n\n\nThose who have difficulty with activities of daily living require at least part-time help from a family caregiver or home health aide. \n\n\nVisiting nurses can make sure that these individuals take their medications as directed. \n\n\nHousekeeping help is available for those who cannot keep up with household chores. \nOther affected individu	health

(26.0 m/s) / (the velocity of sound) = 1/13\nSo the relative increase of the f is as well 1/13.\nSo the frequence heard in the train is (1 + 1/13) x 75 Hz = 81Hz.	science

Again to fall down there should be a force pulling the person from somewhere down below. This is the same force Newton discovered when an apple fall from the tree.	science

How can I tell the difference between chipmunks and squirrels? Do all chips have stripes? I'm trying to win an argument with my dad, so I need proof of sort. We have this "chipmunk" with _no_ stripes, but body/tail shape of a true chipmunk. It also stuffs itself and its cheeks, unlike the squirrels I've observed. My dad says its a squirrel. Its tail is small and fairly straight, with a tiny curve at the end. \n\nI've researched on the net, but can find only chips with stripes. Anyone? (I would really, for once, like to win an argument with my dad! lol)\n\n\nThanks! Well, you're not going to win this argument.  Check out this link (http://www.montereybay.com/creagrus/chipmunks.html) about North American chipmunks, which says:  Chipmunks are small striped squirrels (genus Tamias) in North America. The first thing for a field observer to recognize is that a chipmunk is different from the only other squirrel that is vaguely similar, the Golden-mantled Ground-Squirrel. That colorful squirrel is widespread and easily visible in wooded open country in the mountains throughout western North America.  Note that although the Golden-mantled Ground-Squirrel has black-and-white body stripes it lacks any stripes on the face. It is not a chipmunk. All chipmunks have facial stripes. \n\nSo yours is probably some type of ground squirrel.  Check out this site (http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/view_default.asp?searchText=squirrel&curPageNum=4) for some possibilities (with photos), so maybe you can ID it.  Hope that helps!	science
the way static electricity pulls water towards it, is there a way to repel like that?  Static charge is a charge that is not moving. Therefore it is a build up of opposite charges accross a medium where the current is unable to flow.\n\nWater has a net negative charge. Therefore it would be possible to arrange a pair of plates over a bowl of water with the net negatively charged plate closer to the water.. \nI've never seen this but it should be able to be done and it should repel the water....\n\nOil and Water suffer from this problem.. they are both negatively charged.. This is why they need an "emulsifier" to mix them.. The most common emulsifier in this situation is called DETERGENT.	science
f is defined on [0,1] by f=0 if x in rational,=[1/x] otherwise.Show intregration f in [0,1]=infinity?  If you mean to use the Riemann integral, the function is not integrable since it is not bounded. For the Lebesgue integral, the rationals are a set of measure 0, so are irrelevant. In the interval (1/(n+1), 1/n], the function has value n, so the integral over that interval is [1/n-1/(n+1)]*n=1/(n+1).\nThe sun of 1/(n+1) from 1 to infinity diverges to infinity.	science

How does a triode differ from a diode?  A Vaccum tube diode uses the applied voltage to create thermionic emmisions which results in sending electrons from the cathode filament to the Anode plate. This was replaced by a Semiconductor diode, which  depends on the applied electric voltage to break the barrier formed at the p-n junction. \n\nA triode is similar to a Vaccum tube diode, but gets a helping hand by concentrating the electrons using a Grid. This allows a small change to the Grid voltage to vastly increase the flow of electrons between Cathode and Anode, thus allowing Amplification.\n\nTriode Tubes were later replaced by a Semiconductor Transistors, Field effect Transistors and Bipolar Junction Transistors. However, even today, Tubes can work at far more higher voltage ranges than a semiconductor device.	science

How do they film a sex scene in a movie? I've always wondered, do the actors actually have sex? And I mean movies like Terminator for example, not pornographic videos. They do everything except the actual sex, but of course, even that is dependent on the contracts. If the actress is not willing to bare anything, then the director will find ways to keep her privates hidden while still trying to keep the scene erotic. There is no editing and stuff if all is needed is nudity. Actors and actresses bare as needed. As someone above said, for the sex scenes, sly camera work and appropriate props (like bedsheets) are needed. It's just simulated sex, i.e. they move in ways as if they WERE having sex, but it's not actual sex.	entertainment and Music

Does a guy have to be a rich celebrity to be good enough to marry Brittany Spears without being a leech? People are always downing Kevin Federline for being a leech because he isn't rich and he is only famous because he married her, but no one ever says anything about a woman married to a rich man. Are women the only ones that get to marry someone rich without being a celebrity themselves without people giving them a hard time about it? Do you have to be Nick Lachey to marry Jessica Simpson? Do you have to be Mark Anthony to marry J-Lo? What is the rule exactly? I think if you have a lot to offer someone, it shouldn't matter if you are rich, a celebrity or  in the public eye.  It's a shame people can be so shallow that they pass up "golden opportunities" when they are presented.  I think it also has a lot to do with what circles these people run in.

top ten dirtiest joke on the internet?  A prisoner escapes from his prison where he had been kept for 15 years. As \nhe runs away, he finds a house and breaks into it.

He probably spent a lot of time in prison, \nand has not seen a woman in years. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't \ncomplain, just do what he tells you, give him satisfaction.

Do a thorough job on your work, but make writing your motivation. Do all your homework ((as much as you can)) on real paper and only take the papers you use for h/w so you don't tempt yourself to write when you're too lazy to think for homework. \n\nWeekends offer much free time to write and let your thoughts flow.

What gets a wife interested in making love?  Everyday you need to make her feel special and loved.  That doesn't mean flowers and candy and things like that everyday.  What I mean is that you need to pay attention to things she says to you.  Ask how her day is.  Complement her on her apperance.  Find out what her interests are and talk to her about it.  Getting your wife interested in making love is a daily quest.  You cannot wake up on any given day and think you can "turn her on" with things that work for a man.  She is very different from a man and needs very "different" foreplay.  Hugging her and kissing her at many times throughout the day are a great place to start.\n\nAlso...when she is in the mood.  Traditional foreplay is a must!!!  That means anything that she wants.  Oral sex is a very good way to begin.  Listen to her though- does she sound like she is having a good time?  Follow her lead.	family and relationships

But after 20 years of cheating while he was married will he be able to stay faithful to me? i love him so much i'm scared. You have a right to be worried because many people cheat because it is addictive.  However, everyone deserves to be judged by their current relationship and not their past.  Who this man is with you and the relationship you have with him is unique and shouldn't be compared to his previous relationship.  Be smart and keep your eyes open but give this relationship a chance and don't throw it away just because your scared your relationship will end up like his before.	family and relationships

I'm attractive, black, smart,  5'10 a lawyer no kids cycle/run no guy? I'm told I intimidate. Is that a line?  Those things you've stated don't explain the type of person you are on the inside, your personilty, or how you treat others.  Take a moment and try to see yourself as others may see you.  Is there something intimidating about your character, the way you carry yourself, etc.?  I'm not sure what type of significant other you are trying to attract but it could have something to do with who you approach as well.  If you are drawn to people who have low self esteem and no motivation, you could naturally seem intimidating b/c of your status and success.  From the surface alone, you seem like a good catch.  Good Luck!	family and relationships

Can I be passed over for a promotion at work because I was on Family Medical Leave? I was hired with the understanding that I would be promoted when an opening occured.  While on family leave because I had a baby someone else was promoted and my bose stated to me "because you were gone" someone else was given the promotion. no\n\nQ: Will I lose my job if I take FMLA leave?\n\nGenerally, no. It is unlawful for any employer to interfere with or restrain or deny the exercise of any right provided under this law. Employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, PROMOTIONS or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted under "no fault" attendance policies. Under limited circumstances, an employer may deny reinstatement to work - but not the use of FMLA leave - to certain highly-paid, salaried ("key") employees.\n\nThe second site below provides information on how to file a complaint and\ndetails on potential remedies.	politics and government

Do You Like Pepsi or Coke?? READ BELOW BEFORE ANSWERING!!!? pepsi has come out with a new can that has the empire state building on it and the plege of allegence but they left out "under god" on the can...they said they didn't want to offened anyone...But they want our money that says "in god we trust"! Coke!\nThat is really sad, I'm sorry to offend anyone, but our country was founded on religion (as well as politics) and I'm sure that the Pepsi execs don't scratch off the word "God" from their money when they cash their fat checks from selling their product.\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if it is just a marketing ploy to cause commotion so that they will sell more product.  By making such a statement I'm sure that thousands of people are going to grab a can and look at it in the store, and even more will see it on TV, kinda like having free advertising by changing the can, making them look like their patriotic, then causing a scene and hundreds looking at their product.  \n    Food for thought.	politics and government

I have a paper to write opinions would be a great help!? How has capitalism helped/hurt our society? It's a huge supject and hearing real people about the subject would be great for my paper but if you give an opinion let me know if I can use it in my paper when you send back feedback The answer to social problems is not capitalism or communism, it is somewhere in between ... ideally humanism  applied in governmental form. Sadly power and corruption at the top level generally ensures that which ever system is in operation is mis-used to the detriment of the masses and therefore doomed to eventually fail .... bummed out  millions versus bunkered government ... no contest, if you see what I mean.	politics and government
where can i find a list of what the troops like to recieve in the mail? I want to send a care package and want to send the most needed items or the ones they might enjoy the most. The best web site that tells you what the troops want is AnySoldier.  There, the troops themselves leave messages and wish lists.  Some want penpals, some need care packages for themselves or for their units.  I highly recommend it because you know exactly what they want and who it's going to.  It will give you their address and the items will go directly to them, not some agency to spread them around.  This site is dedicated to men and women in all branches of the military.\n\nThanks for your willingness to support our troops!!\n\n--Army wife of 18 years and 3 deployments	politics and government
have the police got the orthority to enter your property with your house key? my sisters son is always in trouble with the police even tho hes 21 anyway other day police were in her house on their own without permision searching house with a key they had kept from her son this key they did not know the police had taken and kept when my sister came home and found police in her house searching she went mad at them and police said they had the right to enter house cos they had a warrant is this true ? what about your human rights to privacy Even with a warrant the police should ask the permission of the householder (your sister) before entering.  They should also seek entry at a reasonable time. They should not be entering the house illicitly in this way, as it is your sister's home and her son is only a licensee, i.e. someone whom she allows to live there.  He is no longer her dependant, so that is his position. The purpose of the warrant is to make it clear that if, having sought admission, the householder is not willing to admit them, they will then proceed to use force.  What they did was outrageous and in breach of the code of conduct in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) and she would be justified in making a complaint against them.	politics and government

Why is racism still prevalent in modern society, especially the South?  Racism is prevalent in every society in every part of the world.\n\nTo some degree, it's normal to dislike people who are not like you.  In areas where people have contact, but not personal contact, with people of another race, you will find racism.\n\nWe naturally tend to generalize when we don't have intimate knowledge of a particular group of people, and we tend to remember negative impressions longer and in more detail than posative impressions.  It's easy to generalize based on race, since it's usually the most obvious attribute when you see someone.	society and culture
Do you find some Americans to be just as scary as terrorists? I am American. Let's simply face the facts\nsome Americans ARE terrorists\nwhen you get right down to the textbook definition of the term\nthere are a lot of Americans who conduct themselves in a manner as to terrorize others.......Terrorists are not only the people who strap bombs to their bodies and commit acts of mass murder in the name of a cause....they can be the dude that beats the hell out of his family in order to obtain dominance  over their every move.....it can be the gangsters that push people around and harm folks to get them to do their bidding.....An employer who dominates a workforce of people so dependent on the income they receive from a job and so in need of the job that they endure unbelievably harsh and inhumane treatment----so--- yes---there are some Americans who are extremely scary because they ARE terrorists-- just not seen in the same light as what we are being lead to believe is the ONLY form of terrorism !!	society and culture

It is very safe for kids and women, you do not have to worry about burglary, rape, car hijacking, or children kidnapping! Ladies can have a regular life meaning having a job, driving a car and not having to wear hijab (scarf) or abaya (black dress covering all body) like in Saudi Arabia! This shows you already how open minded the country is compared to other parts of the Middle East (we have a lady minister of education for the past 2 years). You need to sign your contract overseas (best deals because you usually get a nice salary, + housing, + car, + insurance) and you also get a tax break of $ 80 K with the IRS if you are US citizen. If you come here and look for a "local hire" position it will be more difficult, and the deals are not good. You need to make sure housing is fully paid by company whatever your require (appartment, villa, etc.) Rentals have doubled and tripled in the past 2 years and you can not find a villa under 15,000 QR (4,000 $ US). Inflation has been very high in the past 2 years (officially 12 % but it is over 20 %). \nThere is an amazing Education City shaping up and several US colleges have already moved in (Texas A&M, Carnegie Mellon, Georgetown, VCU, Weill Cornell with a teaching hospital of 350 beds to open soon).\nYou have to know that we are over 830,000 inhabitants in this country and 3/4 are expatriates (majority coming from south Asia) and about 200,000 Qataris. Right now they try to have more Qataris get good positions and have more Qatari women in the working force, but there is still space for people with good education and experience. Engineering and medical field will always be in need.\nTo find a job over here, you have to apply online and check different sites. I will list you a bunch of sites to visit for more informations and to check job vacancies.\nGood luck!	society and culture
Do you think....? God agrees with the war in Iraq? I can't speak for God.  I can only read the Bible, pray and wait for Him to speak to me.  I can only speak my own opinion and my beliefs.  In my opinion, I don't think God is for senseless war.  God is a god of peace and love, but He lets us choose how we live.  He knows exactly how many wars will occur and exactly how many people will die due to the wars.  I think it's in Revelation where it says "There will be wars and rumors of wars."  I don't think that means God agrees with war, but that He will allow it to happen.	society and culture
What is Holocaust?  Totality of destruction has been central to the meaning of holocaust since it first appeared in Middle English in the 14th century, used in reference to the biblical sacrifice in which a male animal was wholly burnt on the altar in worship of God. Holocaust comes from Greek holokauston (“that which is completely burnt”), which was a translation of Hebrew ‘lâ (literally “that which goes up,” that is, in smoke). In this sense of “burnt sacrifice,” holocaust is still used in some versions of the Bible. In the 17th century the meaning of holocaust broadened to “something totally consumed by fire,” and the word eventually was applied to fires of extreme destructiveness. In the 20th century holocaust has taken on a variety of figurative meanings, summarizing the effects of war, rioting, storms, epidemic diseases, and even economic failures. Most of these usages arose after World War II, but it is unclear whether they permitted or resulted from the use of holocaust in reference to the mass murder of European Jews and others by the Nazis. This application of the word occurred as early as 1942, but the phrase the Holocaust did not become established until the late 1950s. Here it parallels and may have been influenced by another Hebrew word, ô’â (“catastrophe,” in English, Shoah). In the Bible ô’â has a range of meanings including “personal ruin or devastation” and “a wasteland or desert.” ô’â was first used to refer to the Nazi slaughter of Jews in 1939, but the phrase ha-ô’â (“the catastrophe”) became established only after World War II. Holocaust has also been used to translate urbn (“destruction”), another Hebrew word used to summarize the genocide of Jews by the Nazis.	society and culture
Is it religiously moral if  I  am in the bathroom smoking a cigar - and I feel a need to pray, that I pray? or do I need to punch out, go off the clock .. and sit somewhere holy?  Sometimes one can not do both. PLEASE HELP answer this, I feel guilty sometimes. My friend,First, please take no offense at this statement that first hit my mind as I read your question:::It sounds like your practicing some new upscale Voo-Doo ritual practiced by the Papa Doc of the 21st century! all kidding aside, The need for prayer is the way we commune to whatever Higher Power influences our Spiritual existence.In a bathroom, on a subway,standing in a line at McDonalds...it does'nt matter! First of all, its what YOU feel, NOT what is socially acceptable...you as a Human Being has the right to make that decision.If you are influenced by the status quo vote as to how 'you' should act because of some Harris Poll, than you'll never find internal peace of your Spirit and you'll find yourself praying all the time for the right answers and never getting them.Praying is a personal event and no one else has the right to say where ,how, or what should be said...so pray away !...but first...please put out the Cigar!

Favorite thing(s)? Anything and why? Shopping and hanging out with friends and family. Having some nice girl talk. It makes me feel good about myself and I have a lot of fun while doing those things. I love shiny, fuzzy, silky, soft, cute things. They help bring me out of bad moods. They are fun to touch and look at. They are very appealing to the eye. Celine Dion Music it very calming and relaxing and I love to sing along with it. Dolphins, they are SO smart and cute. They changed my life when I swam with them in Florida. Reading a good book. It gives me something pleasurable to do. Knitting it rocks because it easy to learn. Ice skating it is so fun and it makes me feel really graceful. Shall I go on? I don't want to.	society and culture
Another Question for Atheists.....? I received this as part of an answer to "can atheists get insurance for acts of God?" Please explain to me why this is so true:\n\n\n"You can call out to God during sexual intercourse, and you can even blame it on God when you are cursing when you get mad. What mankind will do or say, or even the systems we put in place, will show that we rely on someone else, or even a governmental system, to take care of us or to blame when something goes wrong." Everything about atheists is illogical, especially their notion that the universe was not created by a Supreme Being.	society and culture
