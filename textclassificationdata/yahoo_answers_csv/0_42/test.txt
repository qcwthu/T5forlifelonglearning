How do you get over your wife of 12 yr's, cheating on you for the last three? I'm having a hard time with it, I read all the emails that went back and forth very graphic! It's been 7 months since I found out, and we are trying to work it out but it's damn hard! Cards that wre given to her on days that were supposed to be our special days. Help me get BOB out of my mind. You guys have a difficult task at hand. Cheating for three years... that's a big deal.\nBut, if you guys have decided to work it out, then do just that. Stop reading the emails, cards, etc. It happened and you can't take it back. If you're devoted to making the marriage work, you'll both have to put the past behind you, learn from it and work to make sure it doesn't happen again.\nThis will probably take some counseling. That's a difficult situation for a couple, especially with children.\nGood luck!	family and relationships

Whats that? Im in love with a very sweet guy, but i cant forget my love,who was from the net.? I have got a guy from net from a matrimonial site,and we were in deep love, it was from may 2005.But we havent never ever met in real life, but we knows all abt the each other.Im living in Europe, and he is in India.We planed to meet some day,but i think i was not too patient,bec after 9 months waiting i couldnt wait more and in jan 2006 i have met with a guy from my country,and we started to be in a great deep love! But i cant forget my prev love. I try ,but i cant.Every time when he calls me or click on me in messenger, we r sterting to talk like old lovers, but he always suggest me im not free yet.I really want my new love,he is perfect for me,but my old love also. Plz help, how can forget him,my old love,or what could i do, or give me plz a great advice what could i do.Thx! In person is more likely to be "real" than online. I've met a enough people from online, that you only get a partial view of who they really are. YOu dont see how they really act until you sit across from them. You are in full fantasy mode. \n\nTake a step back and be realistic. Someone far away whom you never met offers only text, a person nearby offers their laughter, shoulder to lean on, their hand to hold. \n\nLove for yourself means letting go when things are not fully right for you.	family and relationships

Does it put men off if a girl wont go down on them? I have a point that I will not give oral sex to a man cause I think its degrading, also I dont know how. Does that put men off if you wont go down on them? If the guy is decent, cares about you and wants a relationship with you and not just sex, then NO it will not put him off. \n\nI actually understand when you say you think it's degrading- I have also felt like that before, when i was with someone who used to get me to do it all the time. It felt very degrading, like he was just getting an ego trip off it. I really struggle with it now, I very rarely feel comfortable doing it although I hope this changes eventually...\n\nI do think though, that if you can build up a really great trusting and comfortable sexual relationship, you'll probably get over it and start feeling differently. As for technique, ask him to demonstrate how he likes it by sucking your fingers! That'll give you an idea of what to do. But even if you never come round to the idea, that's your deicision and don't let anyone tell you you're wrong.	family and relationships

yup what attracts a guy to a girl? versus a girl to a guy? not just romantically--but in every way--emotionally... Opposites attact, correct, but there are plenty other factors in the mix. i.e. how you act around him\nhow you talk to him\nhow you treat him AND OTHERS\nhow you carry yourself\nhow you treat and take care of yourself\n70% of human communication is non-verbal\n\nall these and more is what he see first of all.\nIf you act the way he likes, you don't even have to say anything and he'll feel attraction towards you. Now when the conversation begins between you two, it's up to you to keep your relationship going. A good relationship takes to people to work togethr towards the same goal.	family and relationships
Had a terrible fight over finances with husband.? He wants me to handove entire salary for his credit card stuff. He wants to make sure i have no balance in my account and i need to ask him for money everytime. Having said that, he is also paying a lot of debts and loans from his salary. He says y should i have an account seperately. If i need the money , i can ask him anytime. I wish to be independant economically. This lead to a bad fight. lots of tears and no sleep.. i am dazed and confuse.. does he love me? Help! I'm a big believer in having seperate savings and checking accounts in addition to a joint account.  I've been married for 21 years and most of our fights were about money.  We found very quickly that the best thing to do was put money for household expenses in a joint account, have individual accounts for expenses incurred on our own, and we would put some money in a joint savings account and some in a individual savings.  It sounds like we have a lot of money, we don't.  We learned to budget very carefully, use credit cards sparingly, and to remember that if one of us spent too much money, the pay-off came out of money that was our own and not to depend on each other to bail each other out.  We haven't had a money fight in a long time.  It sounds like your husband is on a power trip and you are there to serve him.  If you work, you have the absolute right to have your own accounts and to have your own money without having to demean yourself by asking to have money THAT YOU EARNED.  If his expenses are incurred by him, for him and had nothing to do with you, your family or your home, they are his and his alone.  Good luck, you are in a tough spot.	family and relationships

what do u think of a long distance relationship ?  If you are in a long distance relationship, it can be very trying.  If the couple can be honest and loyal- it could work, but it seems that distance can make a person think lying is a better option, because they figure "who will find out?"  Ultimately, the whole point of a relationship is to be together, so unless the couple commits to moving or something- I wouldnt recommend starting one up.  It can really mess you up.\n\nOn the other hand if you meet someone far away, it can give you a chance to get to know a lot about each other before you meet face to face- could be good, or bad.  BUT long distance relationships will never last, because togetherness is the goal. Unless thats the KIND of relationship you BOTH want. Eventually someone will have to move closer, or forget about it!  If you move closer together it isnt a long distance relationship anymore, so whether you get together or not- the "long distance" relationship has to eventually end. ;)	family and relationships

can two opposite sex become a good friends? I always end up with most of my male friends misunderstanding me that i have a crush on them. I didn't treart any of them special. I treat them as I treat others. If I kind to one of them, that's mean I kind to rest of them too. But they always think that I like them; so when I make a distance from them, they always end up to have a conclusion I just toying them.\nHow can I avoind such things happen again? actually, many of my closest friends are male. yeah, sometimes they do expect more from me then what they are going to get. but i would just flat out tell them that you aren't interested in that.\nalso make sure that your kindness can't be mistaken as flirting. its a fine line, but it is there.	family and relationships

Should i take my wife back after 15 years seperation?  It sounds like you are still in doubt of taking her back.Only you know how you are feeling.I guess the first question i would have to ask was why you both went your separate ways to begin with?You should always be forgiving,but this doesn't mean you have to repeat the same issues.If you truly love your wife with a whole heart and can let the past be the past,then this could be good for the both of you and i am sure it would work out,it might be different and hard at first after 15 years,but true love always finds it way of bringing things to its level.Again though if you have any doubts i would take this very slow and follow your heart 9 times out of 10 it will lead you right.Hope everything works in your favor.Good Luck to you Both!	family and relationships

I discovered porn in my 14 year old son's bedroom.  What have other parents done in a similar situation? I have suspected he has started masturbating.  Should I ignore it, make a big deal of it, or just talk to him about it? If you want to embarrass him, make a big deal out of it. If not, just ignore it. He is 14, this is a normal thing for him. What is wrong with masturbating? Would you rather he be experimenting with girls? For now let him have his privacy. But you might want to have that talk soon. Don't make an issue of it, just say something like, "Hey, son; When I was cleaning your room/gathering clothes (or whatever it was you were doing in his room...) I found some things that make me think we should talk about sex." I told my son that I understand that it is normal for his hormones to be raging out of control at 14 and if he had questions, I preferred he talked to me about it so he could get the straight dope on it. I did not want him learning it on the street where they are not as likely to tell him about AIDS and other STDs. We had serious chats about it and I told him I would be a hypocrite if I told him "DON'T have sex at your age." He is now 20 and is still a virgin. I suspect that won't be for much longer - much to my dismay - but he has a girl that he is talking about marrying. My only baby will soon be out of my home and in his own! 8>(	family and relationships

What is the best way to ask a guy to prom? I am having trouble, I want to ask a guy to prom, but I'm not sure how to go about doing it. I wish everyone else would have read all the answers before saying the same thing over and over!  Your in high school, don't use your body or promises thereof.  Prom is a place to have fun, not have sex.  I was shy too when I was in school and the straight out approach is not what you want to hear.  I liked the cookie idea, that was original, but it could send the wrong message.  The best way I've found to ask someone out without getting nervous is to present the idea as a joke.  When you are around him, make sure the idea of prom comes up and say something like "Could you imagine me and you going together? Ha!"  When you talk to him, don't stare at your feet or mumble, guys hate that (I am one)	family and relationships

I get strait A's and I play youth softball.  Am I really too young?  I don't think so. You sound mature for your age.. and I think that does play a factor.. I say if YOU feel you are truly ready, and you feel you know what you are doing, and you KNOW how to stay away from STD's and getting pregnant.. Than maybe it is ok..	family and relationships

They cary bad Karma and that's something nobody wants.  People that do that kind of thing are toxic and you should stay away.\nBest of luck.	family and relationships

do you agree with interracila relationships? i've been in an interracial relationship before and i thought it was the best thing in the world, but many other people didn't and this played a major role in our relationship. it's like me being white and her being black didn't mend too well. why? what to do? what to do? I hate to say it, but how people look at interacial relationships will differ greatly from place to place. I personaly have no problem, and think that interacial relationships help broaden the perspectives of both individuals.  There will always be people against it, and it's hardest when one of your family members is truly against it.  All I can say is that if you love the other person it can be great, but stay light hearted with other people and understand that there are a**holes and there are open minded people.	family and relationships

What do Guys think of girls who ask them out? Yeah that's my question to all guys, gals welcome too. Do you think they are cheap? Would you think they are less 'valuable' than the girls that you ask out? If it's a girl that you've been eyeing for some while who asks you out, would you wanna go with her or would you think she's cheap and stop liking her? \n\nI didn't really ask this guy out but I invited him for some party and he thinks that I'm asking him out! OMG! But the thing is I actually like him. I don't know what he will think. I moved over from an Asian country and my mentality is girls should never ask guys out! It is just so cheap. I don't know what American &#92; Western guys think... or girls think. I am embarassed and ...will he think i'm cheap when we go to the party ... \nOr even Asian guys and gals.. what do you think? As a man, I would feel flattered if a woman asked me out - assuming, of course, that I already liked her in the first place and was just too nervous to ask her.  When guys ask someone out, we're taking a big jump.  We hope you'll say yes and that the jump will have been worth it.  However, when you say no, we feel embarassed for having jumped in the first place.  When the woman asks the man out, it saves us from having to jump at all.  However, now you are taking the risk.  I think we are all afraid of being rejected, of having someone not like us.  Asking someone out and hearing the person say yes is one of the biggests leaps in this area.  But, if you already like the person, hopefully that will give you enough courage to ask.	family and relationships

How to handle kids? I am just curious. I like kids but i just dont seem to know how to handle them. When they start to cry or shout or scream i start to run away. And i slow afraid to be near them somehow. So please tell me some technique to overcome it. Thanks. Children, sometimes cry if they do not know you, because they are scared of strange people or if they are kids from friends of yours there is a simple solution to your problem. Playing peek-a-boo with them if they are small babies would make them warm towards you. If older try to start a conversation by telling them your name and asking them theirs. And remember that children can sense when a person is sincere.	family and relationships

How do i and should i ask this girl out? We've known each other for bout a year but not really talked to each other til these past two weeks she has asked me various questions and told me various comments such as: Do you have a girlfriend? and My sis told me that she thinks your cute and have pretty lips.........but i agreed. But these past two days i've called and her phone is off and shes not on yahoo. and shes going on a trip tomarro and a while bak she told me to call her ever night on tha trip......sooo what should i do and how can i ask her out i mean shes HOTT and i like her alot. But mainly HOW DO I ASK HER???? Take it slow. You don't have to ask her out immediately. She obviously wants you so you should keep complimenting her on her looks. Don't be formal with it. Just let her know you think she looks good. Call her every night and ask lots of question. Girls just like talking so she will appreciate it. When you think it is appropriate to ask her sexual questions ask alot. Let her know your interested. When you both feel sexually comfortable with eachother it won't be akward to touch her where  ever she lets you. When you know you can feel on her just about whenever you want, get close to her and kiss her. It is important to get all of that out the way before you are officially dating her. That way it won't be an akward relationship.	family and relationships
I have a boyfriend which i care for and i know he cares for me too, but....? then theres this other guy whom Ive been seeing lately and i feel very attracted to. We have the same friends and we've gone out to the movies and clubs and we get along good, just that he's taking things really slow. Sometimes i feel he wants something serious with me but sometimes he doesnt seem so interested. Should I risk breaking up with my bf of 2 months which is a good friend too to try and work things out with this other guy, or should i say fuck it and stay with my bf? If you are that unsure, you really should be discussing your feelings with your current steady.  He would probably prefer you bring this out into the open instead of stringing him along.  You also should be asking yourself which person would make you happier.  No matter what decision you come to, being honest with yourself and everyone else involved is key.  You risk losing a friend, but in life you are solely responsible for your own happiness.	family and relationships

Girls, is there even a possibility that she does not like me? Does she see me as a really good friend maybe? She has done the following the last few times I have seen her:\n\n1. Never used to touch me until our foots bumped when I was waking her up one time; she then withdrew and tried to grab my arm to pull me somewhere later. She also has touched me increasingly more each time I see her now.\n\n2. We have been friends for years, but we hardly spent time alone. Now, we spend quite a bit of time alone or even alone in our own world between us when talking. We drown out everyone else when talking sometimes.\n\n3. Share stares deeply, at least I think, into my eyes on occasion while we are talking.\n\n4. She started with bumps on the arm. Then she increased to leaning on me, sitting next to me often, high-fiving, and touching my upper leg the last time I saw her.\n\n5. Lately, I have caught her looking at me more and more.\n\n6. She mentions secret things to me that she does not tell others. I know this because I accidently blurted one thing out and she said shushed me.\n\nWhat do you think? Um, no **** she likes you!

If not, why don't you plan a "surprise bubble bath date" for the two of you (believe me she will appreciate it) with candlelight, some mood music, etc. Bathe each other and tell her how you love the way she smells after the bath and what a turn on this is for you. If the "fragrance" has not changed, then you need to tell her that you think may be something is going on down there and you are concerned for her and suggest a Dr checkup.  You could skip the bath, and go directly to the speech, but if its just hygiene, you are sure to miss out on what is bound to be a repeat "appreciation" performance by your girl.	family and relationships

If God exist do UFO's also exist? Does God manage more than one property? Explain why or why not. Over the centuries in many cultures there have often been sightings, drawings and abductions. What do you think? Is there a connection? If God is a construct of how mankind views a supreme existence, and UFO's are a construct of how we percieve the existence of life outside the boundaries of the known realm which we know life exists; then why wouldn't they both exist simultaneously.\n  You're correct that there have been many depictions in a variety of cultures throughout man's recorded presence upon Earth, but what man calls God, has also had a multitude of names and faces.\n\n If God exists, and he created mankind, and mankind has created the machines which we use daily to travel across our planet, to the moon, and beyond. It seems to be that  other beings which God, or perhaps another God that 'manages other property' would also create machines which would accomplish similar tasks.\n\nMaybe the Universe itself is God, and we are just a singular cell of a mighty living organism.	science
What is therapeutic cloning? how does it work?  Therapeutic cloning (also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell nuclear replacement, research cloning, and embryo cloning) involves taking an egg (or oocyte) from which the nucleus has been removed, and replacing that nucleus with DNA from the cell of another organism. The result is a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with almost identical DNA to the original organism.\n\nThe procedure is controversial, and this is reflected in the language used to describe the blastocyst created. Some people believe it should not be called a blastocyst or embryo, since it has not been created by fertilisation, but others maintain that since, given the right conditions, it could still grow into a fetus and eventually a child, it doesn't seem misleading to call it an embryo.\nThe aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain stem cells that are genetically matched to the donor organism. For example, if a person with Parkinson's disease donated their DNA, then it should be theoretically possible to generate embryonic stem cells that could be used to treat their condition without being rejected by the patient's immune system.	science
Do muscle cells utilize energy  (ATP) on relaxation? According to sliding filament theory, ATP is used for contraction, but whatabout relaxation? When cardiac muscles forcefully relax, do they utilize more energy or ATP? I would like to throw in my two cents to this question. First, in order for actin and myosin to attract, calcium is required. Where does it come from? Well to start a muscle contraction, the neurotransmitter ach must be present at the myoneural junction. Now an action potential will travel down the t-tubules and open gates that allows calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The calcium stored there simply diffuses down its own concentration gradient. Now for the muscle to relax the calcium must be re-stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, now it is against its concentration gradient, and it takes ATP energy to put it back. So to answer your question it takes ATP energy to cause muscle contraction and it takes ATP energy to cause muscles to relax. In fact as ATP stores deplete, it takes muscles a longer period of time to relax. I have actually measured this.	science

What Polish Astronomer said the sun was the center of the universe?  Nicolaus Copernicus (February 19, 1473 – May 24, 1543) was an astronomer who provided the first modern formulation of a heliocentric (sun-centered) theory of the solar system in his epochal book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres). Copernicus was born in 1473 in the city of Toruń (Thorn), in Royal Prussia, an autonomous province of the Kingdom of Poland. He was educated in Poland and Italy, and spent most of his working life in Frombork (Frauenburg), Warmia, where he died in 1543.	science

An excess of sodium hydroxide is treated with 1.1 L of dry hydrogen chloride gas measured at STP. What is the? An excess of sodium hydroxide is treated with 1.1 L of dry hydrogen chloride gas measured at STP. What is the mass of sodium chloride formed? One mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters  at STP.  We can safely assume that HCl gas under STP conditions behaves pretty much like an idea gas, so 1.1 liter of HCl gas contains 1.1/22.4 moles of HCl.\n\nEach mole of HCl that reacts with NaOH produces one mole of NaCl.  Because we are told that the NaOH is in excess, the amount of NaCl formed will be equal to the amount of HCl gas.  In other words, 1.1/22.4 moles of NaCl will be formed.\n\nThe molecular mass of NaCl is 58.44 grams/mole, so the mass of NaCl formed will be:\n\n58.44 gm/mol * 1.1/22.4 mol = 2.87 grams.	science
what is the composition of solar wind? does it have any effect on the Earth's magnetic field? The solar wind is a continuous stream of ions (electrically charged particles) that are given off by the sun. Since the particles are emitted from the Sun as the Sun rotates, the solar wind blows in a pinwheel pattern through the solar system. It takes the solar wind about 5 days to reach Earth; it has a velocity of about 500 miles/hour (800 km/sec). The solar wind travels along vibrating magnetic waves which are propagated by the Sun	science

Why can the Insulating Jugs can keep hot water warm?? Science All materials have a heat transfer coefficient.  materials used for insulating have a much lower coefficient so the overall heat that gets transferred from one point to another over a given time is much less.  Given enough time the water would be the same temperature as everything else in the system if no other heat sources are introduced.  Insulators just slow down the process by making it harder for the heat to escape.	science

What is the exact cause of a stitch? (The sort you get when you're running, walking, doing lots of exercise, etc.) A side stitch is a piercing sensation just below the ribcage, usually felt when you're running. In the past, several different theories tried to explain the cause: trapped gas, swollen liver, stomach muscle cramps. However a recent and fairly conclusive theory holds that strain on the ligaments connecting the liver to the diaphragm is the cause. \nThe liver "hangs" from the diaphragm by fibrous bands called ligaments. Running exerts a steady downward force on your liver, stretching these ligaments. In addition, when you exhale (usually as your left foot hits the ground), your diaphragm is pushed up. That means your liver falls with gravity as your diaphragm rises, placing considerable strain on those poor ligaments. \n\nThe result? A stitch. The cure? Stop running immediately and press your hand just below the pain. This should raise your liver up, relieving the strain on the ligaments. Inhale and exhale evenly as you press down. \n\nAs a preventive measure, take deep, full breaths while running. If you take shallow breaths, your diaphragm is consistently raised, which wreaks havoc on your ligaments. Exercise is great, but remember to be kind to the rubber bands keeping your organs in place.	science

(-1)*(+1)=(-1) was proved by Euler; so using that;\n \n          = 1 + (-1)[-1 + 1]\n          = 1 + (-1)*0\n          = 1\n\nThus; (-1)*(-1)  = + 1	science
Why are people so susceptible to concepts like religion? Humans worship their fathers' fathers' fathers' Gods. Why does no one attempt to question the origin of their faith? People are susceptible because people are afraid. Just like everything else in life, they are afraid of their bodies, their minds, their thoughts. When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught. That there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there. Therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope. However, no one really knows what happens after we die so its a crap shoot.	science
Is 5/16 less than or greater than 0.313?  5/16 equals 0.3125.  It's less than 0.313 unless .313 is a rounded off number.  It's considered acceptable to round off a decimal in this fashion.\n\nWhen to Round Up\nRounding up means that we increase the terminating digit by a value of 1 and drop off the digits to the right. If the next place beyond where we are terminating the decimal is greater than or equal to five, we round up. For example, if we round 5.47 to the tenths place, it can be can be rounded up to 5.5.\n\nWhen to Round Down\nIf the number to the right of our terminating decimal place is four or less (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), we round down. This is done by leaving our last decimal place as it is given and discarding all digits to its right. For example, if we round 6.734 to the hundredths place, it can be rounded down to 6.73.	science

A yo-yo's inertia...? A yo-yo has a rotational inertia of 950 g cm^2 and a mass of 120 g.  Its axle radius is 3.2 mm, and its string is 120 cm long.  The yo-yo rolls from rest down to the end of the sting.\n\n(a) What is the magnitude of its translational acceleration?\n\n(b) How long does it take to reach the end of the string?\n\nAs it reaches the end of the string, what are its (c) translational speed, (d) translational kinetic energy, (e) rotational kinetic energy, and (f) rotational speed?\n\nWhat equations did you use to solve this, and can you explain your answers? If you can answer (a) the rest should be easy. You can define an "effective mass" Me as the sum of the mass and inertia/r^2. This is the mass that is accelerated by m*g. Then a=m*g/Me. This can be checked by computing the forces needed for the translational and rotational accelerations; their sum should equal m*g:\nf1=m*a\nang.accel=a/r\ntorque=ang.accel*I\nf2=torque/r\nf=f1+f2 \nMy result was I=0.000095 kg-m^2, Me=9.3973 kg, a=0.12523 m/s^2. \nChecking, f1=0.015027, f2=1.1618, f1+f2=m*g=1.1768	science
What is the acceleration due to gravity at its location? A simple pendulum with a length 1.50 m makes 38.7 oscillations in 180 s. What is the acceleration due to gravity at its location?

what is system 25? error screen on my pc 1. This message occurs when a subaddress is configured. When this subaddress is combined with the X.121 address of the interface, the total address exceeds the limit of 15 characters.\n\n2. The X.25 configuration of the interface is not valid. The existing configuration was not changed.\n\n3. You have attempted an invalid configuration.\n\n4. A virtual circuit has been set up using the default maximum packet sizes, but the data terminal equipment (DTE) and data communications equipment (DCE) are not configured with the same default values. A packet was received that had the M-bit set, signifying that more data follows, but the packet did not carry the maximum number of bytes allowed. Such partial data packets must have the M-bit cleared. The resulting loss of a message boundary might cause problems for the data recipient.\n\n5. An internal software error has occurred.\n\n6. A stacker compression algorithm internal error or a shortage of buffer space was encountered during a compression operation.\n\nNote: This error should never happen.\n\n7. An internal software error has occurred.\n\n8. You have used an invalid configuration ID.\n\n9. The default packet sizes or outgoing packet size facility values of the interface are too large to be carried by Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB). The router will negotiate lower packet size values automatically.\n\n10. A decompression buffer was not available for an incoming compressed packet. This message is a warning only (the compressed packet was not lost). However, an X.25 packet layer RNR (wait) was generated, and packet-level transmission on the logical channel number (LCN) will not resume (RR issued) until a decompression buffer becomes available.\n\n11. An incoming X.25 call specified a protocol that was assigned to a multiprotocol map; the virtual circuit (VC) will not be able to carry the full set of protocols specified by the map.\n\n12. Compression is not enabled because D-bit support is configured for the local channel identifier (LCI).\n\n13. An X.25 interface has been configured to use an X.25 profile that does not exist.\n\n14. You have used an outdated method to specify a virtual circuit range. (An outgoing-only or incoming-only virtual circuit range exactly overlaps the two-way virtual circuit range.)\n\n15. An internal software error has occurred. The PBP header has an uncompressed packet size field. Each uncompressed packet size is checked against this field.	science
is Vibrio a moneran and if so what is a vibrio?  yes, vibrio is a moneran. Monera is a Kingdom of the living world, like the other Kingdoms Animalia, Planteae, Fungi. \nMonerans are prokaryotic organisms, i.e. they are devoid of well defined nucleus, their nucleus do not have nuclear membranes, nucleolus, nucleoplasm, nuclear reticulum etc. these are microscopic organisms, also called as bacteria. Vibrio is a type of comma (',') shaped bacteria, which has one or more flagella."Vibrio" is the generic name, i.e. a Genus under kingdom Monera. the most common example is the Vibrio cholerae, that are present in filthy water and causes the disease cholera when ingested.	science

Question regarding hyperbolas? What is the vertices, asymptotes and foci of this hyperbola? \n36x^2-4y^2=4??\n\nPlease show me the step to reach the answer!\n\nPoints will be awarded ASAP!!!! first you have to put the hyperbola in standard form. Divide everything by 4.\n\n9x^2 - y^2 = 1\nWhich is the same as\n(x^2)/(1/9) - (y^2)/1 = 1\nHere, a^2 = 1/9, so a = 1/3,\nand b^2 = 1, so b = 1\n\nIn this case, the center is (0,0)\nSince the "x" term is first, then it opens left and right. The vertices will be left and right from the center by "a" units, so the vertices are (1/3, 0) and (-1/3, 0).\n\nThe foci are left and right of the center by "c" units. In a hyperbola, a^2 + b^2 = c^2, so c^2 = (1/3)^2 + (1^2) = 1/9 + 1 = 10/9. c = root(10)/3. The foci will be (root10/3, 0) and (-root10/3, 0).\n\nThe asymptotes have slopes that are +b/a and -b/a, and pass through the center, in this case, (0,0). So these slopes are +1/(1/3) and -1/(1/3) or 3 and -3, and the equations are y = 3x and y = -3x.	science

does anyone know the role of the liver in blood detoxification and glucose balance??  Venous blood goes into the liver through the hepatic portal vein before it enters the major systemic circulation. This blood comes from the digestive system so it is nutrient rich.

The livers glycogen stores are the first glucose reserve and are mobilized quickly to maintain blood sugar levels for hours.	science

need info on the trilobite? helpppppppppppppppp mongst the earliest of all known arthropods are the trilobites.  The first species of trilobite are found in rocks of Lower Cambrian age, above the non-trilobite 'Tommotian' Cambrian fauna.  The last known species to have existed are found in the Late Permian.  Throughout their 350 million years of existence in the ancient seas the overall morphology of the earliest and latest trilobites did not vary greatly, however their individual characteristics had many variations and it is these changes that can be studied and used to determine age ( Levi-Setti, 1975).  However it must be remembered that no individual feature is a sufficient guide for classification on its own, it is only with a collection of characteristics that a reliable classification can be made.\n\n Well over 1500 genera are known (Clarkson, 1994) and there are several thousand species, many of which have a stratigraphic value, especially those found within Cambrian and Ordovician rocks.  It is the fact that trilobites are found world wide which makes some of them serve as excellent index fossils, and it is their short life periods which allows precise dates and correlations to be made about the rocks in which they are found.\n\n  Most trilobites were sea floor dwellers, living in the soft sediments, while others were free swimming.  They appear to have been exclusively marine organisms since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rock containing fossils of other salt-water animals, e.g. brachiopods, crinoids and corals.	science

Why is the nature of science? ......That we replace old beliefs with new beliefs based on incoming evidence and facts? science is the mechanism which we use to purify generalizations.   the action of science is exactly the replacement of old beliefs with new ones based on incoming evidence, and human determination, and decision, about what is "fact".\n but this is only the hard machinery of science, the method, the facilitation of the nature, and the vehicle of the essence of science. i am no prophet, and do not intend to subjectively interpret the universe in the manner of pronouncing some concrete, end-all, answer, so in the spirit of science, let us consider science, make some observations, and stab at some generalizations.\n    while observing science, we humans have come to one of the most startlingly obvious, and startlingly powerful, realizations; that of the principle of natural selection. this principle classically refers to biological evolution, and the ever-present consequences which acts on living things and environments when they interact.\nthe principle more recently has embodied a somewhat more anthropocentric form. richad dawkins [1] was one of the early and explicit proponents of visualizing the effort of natural selection as the "selfishness" of genes, and that the driving force of the principle was the expressed selfishness of genes trying to do nothing but replicate themselves, and propagate into the future. the longer that they survive, the more likely it is that they will replicate.  this embodies the cut throat behaviors in nature, as well as the collectivity and cooperativity. this is all very well, and nice, and has been very well recieved in the world of biology  (but not because we are biochauvinists, overly able to relate to something once it is reminicent of human face, but because, the muse of science it the same as the muse of poetry, and imagery enhances scince on a grand scale, so that a better analogies will lead to easier, and better visualization, which will lead to easier and better work). this notion is just precursor to what this question has lead us to. in his book, richard dawkins goes further to introduce the notion of "memes" (mee' ms), which are intended to be the analogue of genes, only in the mental realm. they are ideas, tricks, songs, poems, sloagans... truly, anything which can be abstracted, realized, and passed from one mind to another. so that the idea of memes is a meme itself, and it replicated itself from the mind of an author, to my mind, via language, and if  you have not heard of this already, then it has replicated itself again into your mind. very much like genes, memes continue to exist only through replication, and they may mutate as they pass through different minds. yet, unlike genes, a meme can be very sucessful in replication, and yet be very destructive to its host. take for instance, heroin use. it is a learned trick, which has some concrete subjective effect, and yet ultimately has a negative effect on the life of the host, the replication of their genes. for the most part, memes have no regard for genes. this is dangerous for a society which is driven by memes.\n science seems to be the principle of natural selection, but not gene selection in the way of darwin, but a sifting sort of meme selection, acting on a very small class of memes, serving to develop them into the most powerful and planet altering memes that humans have ever seen. because of the power of these things, the careful selection of the memes of scientific principles is very important. the memes which are selected by science are the human interpretations of the principle(s) of the universe. certainly, natural selection existed before it generated the human mind. it was simply left to science to put it into worded interpretation. this did not take very long. not only that, but more than one person came upon the idea, independent of each other. how universal is the action of science then? \n   in a sense, science is a special case of the principle of natural selection, if you g	science
do anti-biotics become less effective if you have taken them before? do you get immune to them? What happens is that bacteria, which the antibiotics attack, become immune to the antibiotics. Over-prescribing anti-biotics is bad because it causes bacteria to develop resistance. This is why in the past very small quantities of penicillin-type drugs were necessary to treat a bacterial infection, whereas the dosages are now 100s of times greater. This is also why scientists are always struggling to keep up with bacteria which obtain resistance quickly.\n\nThe best strategy is to use antibiotics only when you are sure you need them. If you have a viral illness such as the flu, antibiotics are useless. Also, if you take way too many antibiotics, you risk fungal infections. The reason is because fungi and bacteria are always in competition, and when you eliminate one, the other starts to grow out of hand. Some people have had urinary tract infections from fungi because they took too many antibiotics.  Not a pretty sight. \n\nJust take antibiotics when you have a bacterial infection. If you don't know the origin of your infection (if it is bacterial or viral), your doctor may initially prescribe antibiotics until he can confirm the origin of the infection in lab work.	science

How on Earth do they insulate transmission towers? Transmission towers carry cables which, as we know, like to take a 40kV short cut to Earth if they get hit with a kite or whatever. Yet one can go up to one of these towers and touch it quite safely... That's because there are ceramic insulators that hold the wires/cables to the tower.  You will notice something that has a jagged-looking profile between the metal of the tower and the wire, that is the insulator.  Insulators are up to several feet in length, depending on the designed voltage potential in the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer the insulator.\n\nHigh voltage transmission lines, the types you commonly see on metal towers are usually in the range of 115kV (kilovolts) to 320kV.  In air, it takes roughly 5000 volts per inch for an arc to develop.  At 320kV, you need an insulator over five feet long just to prevent the electricity from arcing to the tower and grounding out.   \nWith this in mind, you do not even need to touch a high voltage wire to get electrocuted, just close enough for the electricity to arc to you.	science
Is it possible to distinguish you if the characteristics by which you are distinguishable from others vary? Taken from invariantology Yes. Even though they change, they are still distinguishing.

what do you know  about gravity ?  It seems that every object has its own gravity, or attractiveness to other bodies. Scientists are still puzzled about gravity, but it seems that the larger the mass of an object, the larger the gravity. The further away from the object, the lesser the attractive force.\n\nAlso...human beings and all other animals on Earth evolved to operate effectively in the gravity on the surface of the planet. When we are in less gravity environments or greater gravity environments for extended periods, the body experiences ill effects. For example, in weightlessness, the body loses muscle mass and bone mass. We need our Earth gravity.	science
How does an oil rig stand in the water where is it anchored to?  Im sorry I've not got the sources for this but I've had experience on several rigs. For a start there are two main kinds of rigs.  \n\nFor drilling a mobile rig is usually used (cos theres no garuntee of oil!). This is usually a large floating structure which is held in place with anchors. Barges carefully transport the massive anchors about 3-4km away then they're dropped and winched in until the line is taught. Were talking 20-30 ton anchors and 4 inch thick cable. The anchors have to be in a close to perfect triangle/square as possible.\n\nThis rig will drill down, hopefully strike oil and cap the well.  \n\nThen a production rig will be moved into that place.  The most common technique these days is to have a huge hollow metal cylinder, capped at each end (i cant remember the design name, help me!) about 100-150m long 20-50m wide. This is dragged out to sea then pumped with water until it stands slightly above the surface. Its amazingly stable and can deflect strong currents.(some dynamics principals I can't remember). All the production lines are protected very well inside the cylinder. Sometimes anchorage is used but its rarely neccessary.  \n\nThe production unit/platform is then neatly plonked ontop of the cylinder. \n\nIn the olden days most offshore oil was close enough to the surface you could built a structure from the sea bed up.

What is the color of the Air?  Air of course we can not see, so at least to humans it seems to be clear. As for the sky...\nhttp://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blue.html\nhttp://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Why%20is%20the%20sky%20blue%3F\n\n"Contrary to popular belief the sky is not blue because of refraction.\n\nRefraction is not a significant enough effect to have this sort of affect although it can change the apparent position of the sun\n\nThe real reason why the sky is blue is due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh Scattering whereby blue light is absorbed by gaseous molecules in the atmosphere ( ie air ) and then re-emitted in a random direction. \n\nThus as white light from the sun travels through the atmosphere the blue light is scattered away from its original direction of travel, and some of it is scattered down towards us which causes us to perceive the sky as blue. \n\nThis is also the reason why the sun is yellow."	science
what are the origins of modern medicines? Beyond medicine, in what other ways do humans depend on plants?  The earliest type of medicine in most cultures was the use of plants (Herbalism) and animal parts. This was usually in concert with 'magic' of various kinds in which: animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits); spiritualism (here meaning an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and divination (the supposed obtaining of truth by magic means), played a major role.\n\nThe practice of medicine developed gradually, and separately, in ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Persia and elsewhere. Medicine as it is practiced now developed largely in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century in England (William Harvey, seventeenth century), Germany (Rudolf Virchow) and France (Jean-Martin Charcot, Claude Bernard and others). The new, "scientific" medicine (where results are testable and repeatable) replaced early Western traditions of medicine, based on herbalism, the Greek "four humours" and other pre-modern theories.[citation needed] The focal points of development of clinical medicine shifted to the United Kingdom and the USA by the early 1900s (Canadian-born)Sir William Osler, Harvey Cushing). Possibly the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection in the 1400's of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general - see Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). People like Vesalius led the way in improving upon or indeed rejecting the theories of great authorities from the past such as Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna/Ibn Sina, all of whose theories were in time almost totally discredited. Such new attitudes were also only made possible by the weakening of the Roman Catholic church's power in society, especially in the Republic of Venice.	science

Conditional Probability Help!!! Arg!! I can't get this!? Gateway and Micron are computer stocks that frequently move together because they represent the same sector of the economy. During a 25 day period, the value of Gateway stock went up 17 days. On 10 of these 17 days, the value of Micron stock also went up. On the 8 days when Gateway stock did not go up, Micron stock went up on 2 of these days.\n\n\nIf Micron goes up, what is the conditional probability Gateway goes up?\n\nIf Micron does not go up, what is the conditional probability Gateway will go up? The conditional probability is the likelihood of an event, given the occurrence of another event.  It is usually written,\n\np(A|B)\n\nwhich is read as "the probability of A, given B."  This conditional probability assumes B has happened.\n\nIn your problem, assuming Micron goes UP, then on 10 of 17 days, Gateway goes up.  Thus the probability of Gateway going up, given Micron going up, is 10/17.\n\nSimilarly, p(Gateway up | Micron not up) = 2/8.\n\nThe key is, you take the first event as given and go from there.	science

do yall think the chupacabra came from another planet or realm because its rarely seen that much.? the chupacabra is a  streange creature that sucks blood from animals like chickens and was sighted in mexica and the united states it has red eyes, grey skin spikes along its back. Actually, chupacabra are an unusual prosimian primate, genetically modified for a phlebotomous lifestyle by American scientists in the early sixties.  \n\nThe chupacabra was originally intended to be released into Cuba as part of a ploy to demoralize the people and topple Castro.  As most elaborate CIA plots, this one failed as the chupacabra escaped during the final testing phase in the American southwest.\n\nEssentially, the chupacabra is a sifaka, but with four razor sharp incisors with which it can slice a small wound.  Its saliva is an anti-coagulant and keeps blood flowing long enough for the chupacabra to take a meal.  Then the chupacabra bounds away quickly, back to the trees to digest its meal.  Sometimes two or more chupacabra will attack one animal.  The more of them that attack, the more likely they will go beserk with bloodlust and start shredding their prey.\n\nThe reason they are seldom seen is their ability to remain completely motionless while they are digesting their meal.  Hanging high in a tree, they resemble largish, hairy coconuts, and often go unnoticed.  Even in areas where coconuts are rare, and unhairy, few people actually look up high in the trees for the critter, and even if they see the hairy ball, they rarely connect it to the cattle mutilations.\n\nEither that or they're completely made up.  That would also explain why they're so hard to find.	science

How to know your rechargeable batteries are no longer usable? I have a few Rechargeable AAA and AA cells for use in gadgets. But they discharge too fast after charging for 12 hours!! Is there any way to know they are practically dead already? Discolouration,etc. After charging, they show good voltage on voltmeter. The only way to know for sure is if they do not hold a charge for any length of time.  Rechargeable batteries can only be recharged a number of times before they will not hold a charge.  When you purchase a new battery, it should state how many times the battery may be recharged before it will no longer hold a charge.  Might be a good idea to keep track of how many times you recharge each battery to know for sure.	science

From which plant or tree is essence of vanilla obtained?  Vanilla is a flavoring, in its pure form known as vanillin, derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla from their seed pods..Madagascar is the world's largest producer.Though there are many compounds present in the extracts of vanilla, the compound predominantly responsible for the characteristic flavor and smell of vanilla is known as vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). Another minor component of vanilla essential oil is piperonal (heliotropin). Piperonal and other substances affect the odour of natural vanilla.\n\nVanilla essence comes in two forms: the actual extract of the seedpods, and the far cheaper synthetic essence, basically consisting of a solution of synthetic vanillin in ethanol. Natural vanilla is an extremely complicated mixture of several hundred different compounds, versus synthetic vanillin which is derived from phenol and is of high purity.	science

How can you find the heat of vaporization of water according to the experimental values given? Scenario:\n\nA beaker of 300mL of water at 64 degrees Celsius is placed into a vacuum bell.  Pressure is relieved and the substance is allowed to boil.  When the bell is removed there are 284mL of water left and the temperature is 44 degrees Celsius.\n\nProblems:\nAssuming that there was no heat lost or gained through a temperature difference of the remaining air inside the bell jar during the time of boiling and that the rate of cooling and boiling was constant,\n\n1. Explain the drastic change in temperature of the water.\n2. Calculate the heat of vaporization of the water in cal/gram according to the energy change of the water that was evaporated. I don't have a calculator handy, but I'll help where I can.\n\nEvaporation is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat.  The amount of heat taken in when one mole of water evaporates is its molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nSo, first, find out how much of the water evaporated.  Assuming standard conditions, 1 mL of water weighs 1g.  So that means that 16g of water evaporated. (With me so far?)  Now use that to find out that you have a bit less than on mole of water vapor.\n\nWhere did the energy that the evaporating water use come from?  The other molecules of water.  You know that the amount of energy released when 284g of water decreases temperature is related in the formula q=mC(Tfinal-Tinitial).  (Only the other 284g of water decreased temp...the other 16g gained temp.)  Now you can figure out how much energy the water vapor absorbed when it changed into a gas.\n\nTake the energy # and divide by the # of moles... and you are set.\n\n\nOh side note: since you are dropping the pressure, you do not need to worry about heating the water up inorder to make it boil.	science

Fish don't live bery long in water that has been boiled and brought back to room temperature. Why do you think this is? Boiling does not remove anything but gases dissolved in the water. Minerals are actually concentrated by boiling since water is removed, but the dissolved solids remain. So, the correct answer is that the oxygen is driven off. Oxygen has no significant solubility in water that hot.  If you really need to boil the water to kill bacteria or something, you can re-aerate the water with an aquarium air rock designed for this purpose. It releases zillions of tiny bubbles into the water. I'd suggest running it for a day or two for a 20 gal tank before reintroducing the fish.	science

literature,fantasy and science:can all these be together in one person?can u tell me which to choose? im 13. i live in india.i am blessed (as they say) with a good power in languages. im a fan of J.R.R.Tolkien and also  very interested in Fantasy. but i like science as much! my interest in science is quite old.Please tell me which line to choose. the problem came when i got less marks in all these because i could not give adequate time to them. Please give a good suggestion to me. It is going to affect my life You know.... There's actually no need to choose. Each of those three things you're choosing from may be focused on at different times. Getting too engrossed in one slows your growth as a person. You have to be able to move between different ideals. It's what makes a well-rounded individual.\nTake me for example, I love all the same things as you. I'm also really into Tolkien, Dungeons and Dragons, and the like. Yet, I am quite well-attuned to the realm of science, as I am a registered nurse and nurse educator. I am also a lover of literature as it makes me retreat to a quiet place after indulging into the intricacies of both science and fantasy.\nTry it. Focus on each one in turn. But not on all at the same time. It's easier that way.	education and reference

tell me about a greek oracle? Someone plzz tell me about a Greek oracle.\nGimme some info. THX The word oracle in Greek can mean several related things. It means a god who predicts the future, like Apollo. It also means the priest who hears the message, and the message itself, and the place where the priest hears the message. Most often it means the priest or the message. \nThe Greeks believed (like all other ancient people) that you could communicate with the gods at certain places, at certain times, through certain people, and that the gods would give you advice and maybe tell you what was going to happen in the future. \n\nBut the Greek oracles had a couple of advantages too. First, you didn't just come and ask your question. You had to hang around the temple for a while, talking to the priests, so they could get to know you. And they could see you, not just hear your voice on the telephone. Second, everybody came to the same few oracles for help, and the priests at these oracles (unlike the Psychic Hotline) compared notes with each other. So if you asked "Should I get married?" and the oracle said "Yes," and then next week your girlfriend comes and she asks, "Will Gorgias ask me to marry him?" then the oracle already knows the answer to that one. There is every reason to think that the oracles were worth the money they charged. \n\nhttp://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/LAO.html\nhttp://www.paralumun.com/greekfuture.htm	education and reference
how different/similar are IQ tests and SATs? are they interchangable in any way These two tests are totally and completely different. SAT tests are interested in strictly knowledge. Basically, how well you can do math and grammar exercises (analogies, etc). IQ tests are interested in how logical of a person you are, and how deeply you read into things. There are also lots of "problem solving" kind of questions on there.\n\nIn any case, these two types of tests are completely different.\n\nHope this helps.	education and reference

Does Caesar posess a tragic flaw that leads to his down fall?  Caesar's tragic flaw was confidence/arrogance, along with the inability to take advice from others.  Caesar thought he was untouchable and never contemplated his own friends would turn on him.  He was warned by the Soothsayer, whose advice he did not listen to, and was advised by his wife to stay home; again he did not listen.  If Caesar had been less sure of himself, he would have been more likely to listen to the advice of his wife (I can understand not listening to a random stranger on the streets).  This would have saved him.  Also, his arrogance was what led him to be killed in the first place.  The other Senators were tired of Caesar's rule and afraid he was attempting to become Emporer.  They wanted him stopped.	education and reference

What can we do to improve children's access to primary education, and improve the quality of education? How can we affect change in school systems around the world so that our children are prepared to succeed in the 21st century? The quality of education is hampered because teachers are now being asked to teach children the social skills that families used to promote.  Unfortunately, as a teacher, all too many times I have to deal with issues that have absolutely nothing to do with what I want to teach my kids.  Children's behavior stymies the amount and quality of teaching that goes on every day.  When reflecting upon what the major cause for this, I always go back to the lack of caring many parents have towards their child's education.  Our society has fallen into the "it's all about me" syndrome, and parents aren't doing their part.  Our government is now working at holding the schools accountable for what is taught and the academic success of the students attending, but until parents are held just as accountable, then our schools (especially those in the urban arenas) are going to continue to struggle.  Thanks for the question Joe.	education and reference

How do you talk more interestingly? (please, no little kids answer this question)This sounds like a stupid question, but how do you put more pizzaz in the way you speak? For example, i look at one girl and she has the most to say, but no one is interested in what she is saying because she sounds boring in the way she speaks, she as the same boring tone and  facial expressions.....But yet i look at this other girl and she says a few simple things, but yet it is INTeresting because she has PIZZAZ in the way she speaks! How do i talk more interestingly so i can say few words and people will be fine with it? I am that dull person with no expression in real life, although I can open up when I feel like it. \n\nWe quiet types like to examine other people alot. If I am listening to a conversation to which I have nothing to add, then often I just zone out and stop listening, and I start examining facial expressions and body language of people around the group.\n\nOne thing I notive is that if you want people to listen to you, eyes are of key importance. Eyes can show a full range of emotion all by themselves. If you want proof go see a Blue Man Group peformance. They never speak, and never move their faces at all. They let their eyes tell the story, and the effect is fantastic. Do the same in coversation. Open your eyes wide, and look interested in what you have to say!\n\nBe confident, and smile. Jokes add colour to your words, but don't tell the wrong joke to the wrong audience. \n\nUsing your hands to emphasize your expression can be a good tool, but don't overdo it. An example of overdoing it would be using your fingers as little puppets to act out everything you're saying (that may seem a bit extreme, but I know someone like that).	education and reference

where did the phase basketcase come from?  In its original meaning it comes from the US military immediately following WWI. Strangely though, the term was never used to describe anyone - only in order to deny that any such servicemen existed. This bulletin was issued by the U.S. Command on Public Information in March 1919, on behalf of Major General M. W. Ireland, the U.S. Surgeon General:\n\n"The Surgeon General of the Army ... denies ... that there is any foundation for the stories that have been circulated ... of the existence of 'basket cases' in our hospitals."\n\nThis bulletin was reported on in many U.S. newspapers at the time. Many of them also defined what was meant by 'basket case'. For example, this from the New York paper, The Syracuse Herald, Mar 1919:\n\n"By 'basket case' is meant a soldier who has lost both arms and legs and therefore must be carried in a basket.\n\nGiven that the term was originally reserved for incapacitated servicemen, there wasn't much call for it until the next major war of English-speaking peoples - WWII. Again, it comes from the U.S. military and again in the form of a denial from the Surgeon General. In May 1944, in 'Yank', the then Surgeon General, Major General Norman T. Kirk, said:\n\n"... there is nothing to rumors of so-called 'basket cases' - cases of men with both legs and both arms amputated."\n\nClearly, given the scale of the casualties in both wars, there must have been cases of multiple amputation. It isn't recorded what term the U.S. Surgeon General used to describe these - clearly not 'basket case'.	education and reference

was the colonization of cape verde peaceful or not?  The Cape Verde islands experienced the longest period of European colonization of any African nation. The Portuguese remained in direct control of this island archipelago from 1460 to 1975. In their struggle for independence from Portugal, beginning in the 1950s, the people of Cape Verde linked their fortunes to that of Guinea Bissau on the West African mainland under a unified movement, the PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde), formed in 1956.The armed struggle against the Portuguese lasted from 1963 until 1974 when a negotiated peace settlement was arranged. While achieving independence for themselves, the Portuguese African resistance movements, including those of Angola and Mozambique, had succeeded in bringing down the fascist Portuguese government in Lisbon. Elections were held in June 1975, and the Republic of Cape Verde was declared formally independent from Portugal on 5 July.\n\nAlso check out http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-129476/Cape-Verde\n\nHope some of this helps =)	education and reference

Economics or Engineering? I'm starting my freshman year in the fall. Which would be better, considering job market, pay, competitiveness, and prestige and any other factors? I'm planning on following through with a masters degree in whichever major that I end up choosing. If you're going on with a masters afterwards anyway, then I'd say the Engineering will serve you better at the undergrad level, regardless of which direction you choose.\n\nI'm just finishing my Ph.D. in Economics.  When I was applying to grad schools, I was shocked to learn that the Econ grad programs actually give preference to undergrads with Engineering or Math majors OVER Economics majors.  The reason for that is because grad programs in Economics today are heavily math-intensive, and they have observed that Engineering and Math undergrads tend to do better in the Econ programs.\n\nSo, regardless of what you decide to do later, the Engineering major will be better for you.  If you want to keep all your options open, do an Econ minor along with it.  That way, you've got another 3 1/2 years to decide which route you want to take.  \n\nGood luck!	education and reference

Is Diet coke and/or Pepsi really diet? i've heard rumors that they will make you gain weight as much as reg  yea, as with what everyone else said thus far, here's another fact: one of the substitute sugars they've been inserting in low calorie/diet foods and drinks, I think the Amphet..somethingsomething, isn't even digestable to us humans. It's a total manufactured chemical that our bodies are no knowledge or digestive bacteria to properly digest it. Therefore, it is not good for you. I'd say diet sodas are worse than regular sodas, period. If you want a soda, drink a regular. Otherwise, here's another fact: you can lose an average 10lbs in one year just by cutting soda out of your diet completely. Think about that. The shet is useless to begin with.	health
can you take tramadol with trazodone and rozerem?

Please help me :( Why am I so worried? Ahh, okay here I go. I know this may sound stupid to most of you, but I don't know :( Well, I was with this guy from September 8th -12th and although we did not engage in sexual intercourse, I gave him a handjob and he fingered me. Although his fingers weren't like "dripping" with his semen or anything, I'm worried MAYBE there might have been *some* of it on him. He also never went inside of me, he was just rubbing "down there"\n\nWell, I got my full period three days later (on Sept. 15) and got my period again on (although it was late like 2-3 days) October 16th. Usually, I spot around ovulation, but this month I didn't. My breasts hurt a lot and stuff, and have been hurting since when I should have ovulated (Oct. 31st) I should have my period next week some time, if everything is "normal"\n\nThe question is, is there any way that I could still be pregnant? I am SO worried, I think maybe the guilt is getting to my head. I understand I am not ready for this stuff. Any help is appreciated. I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant! Just to be on the safe side, if I were you I'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period (or a week after you do). Good luck and try not to be such a nervous wreck, enjoy yourself!	health

How can I get rid of razor burn on my legs? Whenever I shave my legs I get little red bumps which I assume are razor burn.  Is there anything to get rid of or prevent them? get rid of them:\nlet your skin heal, you're abusing yourself.\n\nprevent them:\nyou could try a dipilatory like neet but wait until after you've healed.  I've heard bad things about the type of hair removal systems that *pluck* your hair out.  If you're prone to ingrown hair you may want to avoid these and the dipilatory as well.  \n\nA lotion and an electronic razor may be your salvation.  They're smooth and don't cut deeply.  Your pantyhose may stick soon after shaving though but it won't look bad.\n\nGo natural?  Some men like that.  Whatever you do you'll adapt to your own body and learn what to do and when to balance being comfortable and presentable as well.  Heal first though, then try something that doesn't hurt you.  Eventually the razor burn will go away but leave your skin rougher and harder if you continue with what you're doing now.	health

He said "water, plain old water" He then told me to roll ovr onto my back,and pull down my panties. well you know where I got that shot..IN THE BUTT. It hert like HELL!! should a doctor be able to do that? You never mentioned what your symptoms were. The only reason I can think of your getting the shot would be for vomitting ( it will dehydrate you), and it was a shot of finegrin. It numbs an upset stomach to calm the nasea. Also, if you were dizzy and dehydrated, a doctor will administer the same for precaution to keep you from vomiting. How much you drink does not mean that's how much your body would retain. As far as his tone and the words he chose, there he was wrong. The rest he was probably correct. If you were dehydrated too much he would have put you on an IV. My opinion is that the shot was a precaution to save you the burden of an IV.	health

I also think I have little cellulite, some people agrees with me but most say I dont. But how can I get rid of that and get into pretty good shape within 3 weeks or less? The following healthy living recommendations will help you if your trying to lose weight, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:\n\n*1) Burn more calories then your consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity. Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily  calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and log your physical activities.\n\n*2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. \n\nAvoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water. \n\nDo not try fad diets. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/PyramidLRG.gif?osCsid=26a424be471d1337e7c2f105d5c64d9d\n\n*3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities. \n\nRead a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is “Weight Training For Dummies”. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter.\n\nA good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is “Fitness For Dummies”. \n\n*4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety. \n\n*5) Educate yourself continually on health issues. A good free publication is  “Dietary Guidelines For Americans 2005”. A superb book to read is “You The Owner’s Manual”. An excellent periodic publication is the “Nutrition Action Health Letter”.\n\n*6) Make a life long commitment to good health. A great test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com Look at other areas where you can improve your health.

How can I prevent my Asthma from acting up so frequently while still on my regular medication? The question is sort of self-explanitory Hi Sentaka\n\nHere are some ideas on how to heal your condition.\n\nCause: \nAsthma is caused by malnutrition. Only by diligent and consistent effort to change embedded habits will one get permanent relief. The cough is a result of nature's effort to expectorate mucus from the lungs, after which breathing becomes easier. Ofttimes the cause of asthma is basically a nervous condition because the nerves are irritated \n\nHerbal Aids: \n1. Convulsions: When a person is in a convulsion there are certain herbs that will give very fast relief. One of these is tincture of lobelia, and a valerian decoction with a little cayenne added to relieve spasms. If such an attack comes after a meal one should use an emetic, such as a large dose of lobelia or use the Yoga finger method. (see # 2 below) \n\n2. Yoga Finger Method: Drink several cups of warm water, then place the middle finger deep down the throat and press the tongue until regurgitation starts. Mustard is also good to clean the stomach and lungs. Prior to the emetic a peppermint or spearmint tea should be used to soothe the area and alleviate the discomfort of continual vomiting. Hot fomentation of castor oil, comfrey, lobelia, mullein, etc., may be placed over the stomach, liver, spleen and lung areas. Frequent hydrotherapy baths or lengthy sweat baths are beneficial, followed by a cold shower or sponging. \n\n3. Vapor Bath: Another helpful method is to take a vapor bath twice a week, inhaling steam from a decoction of cudweed ragwort, wormwood, or a decoction of the following herbs, taken warm, (equal parts) will prove very beneficial: elecampane root, horehounds, hyssop, skunk cabbage root, vervain, wild cherry bark (and to this preparation add tincture of lobelia or antispasmodic tincture. Clear the bowels with an injection of catnip or barberry bark. This affliction also calls for plenty of outdoor exercise, deep breathing, and good ventilation while sleeping. The whole body system should be built up with tonic herbs such as chickweed, comfrey, marshmallow, mullein, etc. Diet should be mostly fruits and vegetables, avoiding all processed devitalized foods. \n\n4. Dr. Christopher's Herbal Respiratory Formula: (Resp-Free) It is wonderful for asthma. This combination of herbs in tablet, tea and capsule form is an aid to relieve irritation in the respiratory tract--lungs and bronchial. This is an aid in Emphysema as well as other bronchial and lung congestion such as bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, etc. Suggested amount for an adult is a cup two or three times a day, or 2 or 3 capsules or tablets two or three times a day with a cup of comfrey tea. For additional help in the program, it is good to add three to six drops of tincture of lobelia to each cup of tea. This formula consists of comfrey root, mullein, chickweed, marshmallow root and lobelia. \n\n5. Dr. Christopher's Hay Fever Formula: (Sha Tea) It is good for asthma also. This combination is a natural herbal aid working as a decongestant and antihistamine to dry up sinuses and expel from the head and broncho pulmonary tubes and passages the offending stoppage and mucus. Combine this with the respiratory combination to speed up the process. The wise person will turn to fresh wholesome food and beverages to keep the body in a perfect state. This will guarantee permanent relief, by going to the cause. \n\n6. Elder: The inner bark is used, although it should be aged before used. The fresh bark is violently irritating and poisonous to children. It is specifically used for spasmodic asthma with copious phlegm and stringy mucus. For asthma, take a tablespoonful whenever an attack threatens. Powdered Cloves can alleviate excessive vomiting when using the bark. To avoid bowel cramps, add a tablespoonful of powdered Ginger to the infusion. (ShoA:58). \n\n7 Lobelia: Most people agree that Lobelia is a specific treatment for asthma, as well as other bronchial or spasmodic troubles. Because the herb removes obstructions, g	health

sexual abuse... by a female? My cousin's best friend was sexually and physically abused when she was 10 by another female. I can't see how a female is capable of such actions, is it really true that females are just as capable of sexual abuse as guys? It just really weirds me out... I hope that so-called 'female' is locked up for life. Sure .. a woman is capable.. sexual abuse isn't just about a man forcing a girl/woman to have sex...  sexual abuse involved anything that one person does to another person against their will that involves any kind of sexual act... touching..  making somebody remove their clothes for the purpose of looking at them... making the person touch the one doing the forcing.. and much more...  so, if this woman made your friend touch her..  or she touched your friend.. in any manner considered sexual, it's sexual abuse.. that includes kissing.. and can include some types of hugging...  could be in some countries the laws are somewhat different... but I believe in Canada and the USA, the laws are similar. I hope your friend files charges if she really feels she was abused.	health

My hands andmy ELBOWS get really dry help?!?!?  Dry skin\nDry skin is common; as skin loses moisture the surface cracks. \n\nThe inherited forms of dry skin are known as ‘ichthyosis’ (fish-scale skin). There are various kinds of ichthyosis. Dermatologists often call dry skin arising in later life ‘xerosis’, ‘asteatosis’ or ‘acquired ichthyosis’. \n\nThe dry areas may result in dermatitis, i.e. the skin becomes red and itchy. This may result in a crazy-paving appearance on the lower legs (‘eczema craquelé’), or round patches scattered over the trunk and limbs (a dry form of nummular dermatitis). Sometimes the dry skin is just itchy, without much of a rash (sometimes known as ‘winter itch’, ‘7th age itch’, or ‘senile pruritus’). \n\n \nIchthyosis   \nClose-up of ichthyosis   \nDermatitis from dry skin  \n\nCauses of dry skin\nFactors which contribute to dry and cracked skin include: \n\nInherited factors \nMetabolic factors such as an underactive thyroid gland, or excessive weight loss. \nIncreasing age, resulting in decreased natural lubrication. \nCool weather, especially when windy or the humidity is low. \nAir conditioning, central heating or sitting close to a fire or fan heater. \nExcessive bathing, showering or swimming, especially in strongly chlorinated hot or cold water. \nContact with soap, detergents and solvents. \nFrictional irritation and chapping. \nTreatment of dry skin\nAn important aspect of treatment is to identify and tackle any contributing factors (see the list of causes above). \n\nReduce how often you bath or shower, and use lukewarm water. Showers may be better than baths. \nReplace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, etc. \nApply an emollient liberally and often, particularly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. \nTreat eczematous patches with a topical steroid for a 5 to 15 day course. These are prescribed by your doctor and should be only applied to the red and itchy areas. \nLong term control\nDry skin is usually a long term and recurring problem, especially in winter. When you notice your skin getting dry, resume your lubricating routine and use a non-soap cleanser. If the itchy dry-skin rash returns, use both the lubricating routine and the prescription steroid cream or ointment. \n\nso now u can work out what u got...so is the treatment...\n\nis it usfull...if not pls contact me..\n\nget well\ngood luck	health
sleeping with prostitutes ! is it right or wrong ? i occasionally sleep with prostitutes (when have no girlfriend )i do enjoy it , i would prefer it when having sex with girlfriend . i find it frustrating when getting no sex and thats why i sleep with prostitutes , is it right or wrong to pay for sex ? You seem to be conscious about what you are doing so if you can afford it, hey why not?  In a way it's the same thing or maybe even better than picking up a girl at a bar and taking her home for a one night stand and then never calling her again cuz you just used her for sex and if she is innocent and not on the same vibe, she'll feel crappy and used.  The only thing is be careful!!! Use protection - more than one method.  I guess there is always a risk when sleeping with a prostitute which is a risk that can cost you your life - STDs.  But this is true for anyone you sleep with that you don't really know (like what happens amongst college kids all the time).  Man, I used to be a crazy in university and was very promiscuous so the same is true.  Some people even know the people the sleep with but there is a lack in trust or education.  Case in point, unfortunately in this day and age, sex is a bit of a risk.  And regardless, even when you are careful, often condoms can and do break.  Just be smart, educated, and careful.  Go with a good escort agency instead of picking up a sketchy hooker on a shaddy street that would do anything to get cracked up.  And don't forget that there is also a certain pleasure in renting a good porn and being with yourself.  It's very underrated but feels so good to give yourself pleasure - you know what you like, how you like it, etc.  Even this you can make exciting instead of just a wack off.  If I'm horny, I go home and take a bath and rub myself and then I wear some secy nightie just for myself and then I'll drink some wine and watch some porn and get on a table or on the floor or infront of a mirror and let myself pleasure me.  It's totally enjoyable sometimes even more than sex with a partner.	health

What ever happened to Smelling Salts?  Back when my heart was a bit blacker we had "smelling salts" in the first aid cabinet at a place I used to work. It was a liquid chemical in a small glass tube wrapped in fiber. Whenever they hired someone new I would grab one and start sniffing it (unbroken) and then ask the new guy if it smelled funny and crush the vial as I handed it to them. Explosive reaction everytime! Mean but funny.	health

Why would my upper spine (neck) hurt while doing squats? what could the problem be? it was a cramping pain that lasted around 30 min. and was sore after that there are numerous possibilities \n\nyou may have slightly pulled one of the upper back muscles such as the trapezius that run up and into the neck - if you posture is slightly off when you load this can happen \n\nice the area, use ibuprofen and lay off for a day or two\n\nyou may have slightly irritated a disc in your neck  same as above for treatment but if it persists or you have any pins and needles in your shoulders, arms or your neck mobility is reduced seek medical attention\n\nI am assuming you squat with a bar on your neck? When you squat try and have the bar back and down slightly off your neck so the weight distributes across the shoulders - have your arm grip wide to keep it stabilised and make sure or learn to squat with perfect form - head up not down - your upper back should be locked steady - the only rotation is through pelvis, hips and legs \n\nif you still have a problem try to learn to front squat or do one leg squats with dumbells	health
what is milk thistle for?  Milk thistle is used to treat inflammatory liver ailments, especially chronic illnesses, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. Gallbladder ailments and related digestive symptoms, varicose and spider veins problems in the legs and jaundice are helped by milk thistle treatment, as well. A silymarin injection is an antidote to poisoning from the "death cap" mushroom, amanita.\n\nTherapeutic Effect\n      The active ingredient in milk thistle seeds is silymarin, a combination of three different flavonoids that supports the walls of liver cells, preventing poisons from penetrating them. It also stimulates the regeneration of these cells. Bitter principles and amino acids help support the entire digestive system.\n\nSilymarin as a liver tonic\n      People with acute liver problems should follow a six-week treatment with tea made from milk thistle seeds (below, in healing tea mixtures) several times a year. This tea treatment program is often recommended for people with liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake and cirrhosis.\n\nHow silymarin works\n      Silymarin helps prevent liver poisoning in two ways. It changes the liver cell walls in such a way that it is very difficult for poisons, such as cabon tetrachloride, to penetrate the walls. Silymarin also stimulates cell division so that new liver cells will grow continually.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMethods of Administration\nTea\n      For poor digestion, drink this tea 30 min. before meals. To support blood vessel integrity for the treatment of spider or varicose veins, drink 2-3 cups of tea throughout the day.\nPour 1 cup of boiling water over 2 tsps. of crushed seeds. Steep 10-15 min. and strain. There is no time limit on treatment with this tea; its use may be ongoing. \n      Peppermint increases the effectiveness of milk thistle tea and improves its taste. When you make the tea, add 1 tbsp. of peppermint leaves to the mixture.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTincture\n      For gallstones or other gallbladder concerns, take 20-30 drops up to 3 times daily until the condition improves. To prepare the tincture, mix ¼ cup of crushed seeds with 1¼ cups of rum in a clean glass jar. Cover tightly and shake well. Let stand for 4-6 weeks, shaking every few days. Strain out the seeds and bottle the liquid. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNutritional Supplement\n      To support good liver function, eat 1 tbsp. of ground seeds daily. In a coffee grinder or spice mill, grind seeds to add to hot cereals, muffins, rice dishes and other whole-grain meals. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMedicinal Uses\nTincture for intensive treatment\n      Silymarin is only partly water soluble, so for an intensive treatment to protect and regenerate liver cells, you should also use a tincture made from milk thistle seeds to increase the effect of the tea. Put 10 drops of the tincture into 1 cup of milk thistle tea. This tincture can also be purchased in health food stores. Caution: Because of its alcohol content, never use the tincture if you are suffering from acute liver inflammation or alcoholism.\n\nLeaf tea for aiding digestion\n      You can also make therapeutic teas from the leaves of the milk thistle. They do not contain silymarin, but they have an overall positive effect on the liver and gallbladder, and a tea made with them is valuable for improving digestion and for easing mild digestive complaints. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over 1½ tsp. of finely chopped leaves. Steep for 5-10 min. and then strain. Drink 2-3 glasses per day.\n\nCompresses for varicose veins\n      The external application of the tea in a compress can help varicose veins and open leg sores. Make the tea; cool. Soak a cloth in the cooled tea and apply as a damp compress 	health
how to be a good businessman?  I consider myself to be a very good businessman. I have the perfect solution and it has worked for me for over 39 years.\n\n1. Be a listener, not a talker. I learned more from listening and retaining than speaking.\n\n2. Be honest, conduct yourself in a humble manner. Humility and Honesty are 2 of the greatest Virtues.\n\n3. Surround yourself with people smarter or more intelligent than you and listen to them, pick their brains and learn from mistakes.\n\n4. Lastly, pick up Donald Trump's book "The Art Of The Deal".\n\nThis book will give you everything you will ever need to know regarding being a good businessman.

Because people who have it could never really have totally risk free sex with a non-carrier, the condom could always break.

Eating or drinking sugar does not cause diabetes..Family history,being over weight, lack of exercise..is the main reasons people get it.\nWhen you have diabetes your body doesn't produce and or use insulin properly,,That is why a person with diabetes has to watch what food/drinks they consume..because their body doesn't use insulin the way ..say yours does.. \n If you don't have major risk factors for it 4 teaspoons of sugar a day will not cause you to have diabetes..If you want a good alternative to real sugar try splenda..it tastes just like real sugar...I use it in my kids kool-aid and they love it. Also my mom used to be a sugar hound and I gave her a bag of splenda last year and she hasn't bought real sugar again..she even bakes with it..

$40 copay but no deductable. what does that mean? I am trying to figure out if my insurance covers NuvaRing.

Im new to this and would like to know what this means. it also says that coinsurance was 80%. oh and my insurance is BlueCross BlueShield Tenneesseee You have to pay $40 each time you get a presciption filled, but there is no yearly minimum you have to reach in out of pocket expenses before the insurance kicks in.\n\nFor example, If you have a $50 deductible and $10 copay, you would have to pay $10 each time you got a presciption, but first you would have to spend $50 of your own money on presciptions.  Then you would pay just the $10 copay and the insurance would pick up the rest.\n\nDeductible is how much you have to spend of your own money before the insurance will cover anything.\n\nCopay is the portion you pay once the insurance starts covering costs.	health

Is being dramatic/impulsive a learned behavior or just part of a persons character? My bf thank for God for him, point it out to me that I was both dramatic/impulsive. I honestly didn't know but hes helping me to think more before I speak and to not get to excited or overwhelmed when something happens. Are these extremely bad behaviors? Can they be corrected are will they just be apart of my character? First Dramatic and Impulsive are 2 totally different things. Being dramatic to a situation usually means you are wanting attention, good or bad by taking the situation to the extreme.  Impulsive is to react without thinking, that can be to yell and get angry over "nothing" or to blow your entire paycheck on a pair of shoes when rents due.  To answer your question they are part of character, and can be altered.  But any behavior you don't like can be changed.  Just like your boyfriend pointed out, you can think before you react, that goes a long way.  You should do that even if you don't think your a drama queen and/or impulsive.\n\nMore importantly you are not making these changes because HE wants you to.  You have to make the change for yourself.  Otherwise it really doesn't do any good.  You'll revert back to your "old ways" once he's no longer with you.  If this is something you've found to be a problem then make the change, fact is no one like a drama queen only in small doses, and there are good and bad sides to being impulsive.  I'd like to see you keep a part of each and use in moderation when the time is right.\n\nGood luck!	health

What's the best way to lose 40 pounds in 3 months?  Two pounds per week is (generally) the most you can shed without risking harm or unwanted side effects of a diet.  There's no quick magical way to drop 40 lbs in a very short time, although product ads will try to convince you otherwise.  A strict well-disciplined Weight Watchers Diet for example, can allow you to lose the 40 lbs in about 20 weeks (5 months).	health

i'm trying to get pregnant now and today is ovalation day can i try or what to do pleas help me out?  You really should have started trying a few days ago. The best time would be about 2 days before ovulation to give the sperm time to reach the egg. Sperm are not very fast and could use the extra time especially since the egg has limited viability (24-48 hours). If you don't get pregnant this month, you may want to test next month with a predictor that gives you a day or two advanced notice. If I find the exact speed for sperm I'll modify my answer to give you a more exact idea. Good luck.	health

Shower in the mornings before you start your day to know you are clean and apply deoderant on freshly cleaned skin.  I know that your sweat can smell stronger when you've eaten spicey foods and a lot of greasy foods, so maybe the tent is from the foods too.  Or maybe you aren't drinking enough water either.

I broke my back at work .....? and tried to get better for a year, not knowing it was too late to sue the employer who fired me a month after this all happened (becasue they said I was working too slow)  I was there 8 years and just got a new superintendent (boss) who wanted there own people in, who made me do a job I kew was not safe, who now got fired herself for no one will say why. The only thing I could do is apply for disability (I did) What is the best way to get disability was turned down twice and now hired a attorney, still seeing doctors who say they cant do much becasue of where it is L5 dont know what to do. The one year statute of limitations does not apply to all cases.  Make sure that your attorney does personal injury law.  There are many areas of law.  Do you have any evidence to support your claims?  Medical records, work schedules, work assignment sheets could be used to prove that there has been a substantial change in your ability to do work for that particular employer.  Some states allow up to three years for medical claims due to the outcome of the treatment not being immediately available.\n\nFiling for unemployment compensation should be sought; whether it is awarded or not.  This is done at state level and usually involves filling out paperwork to substantiate your claim.  Your employer will be asked to submit a statement.  This step will help to validate the reasons for your dismissal from work.\n\nSee resource reference:  www.merck.com  \nExtensive loss of body functions can be devastating, causing depression and loss of self-esteem. Learning exactly what has happened and what to expect in the near and distant future helps people cope with the loss. Physical and occupational therapy (see Rehabilitation: Physical Therapy) helps preserve muscle function. Therapists teach people special techniques to help them overcome lost functions. For most people, compassionate and skilled nursing care, psychologic counseling, and emotional support from family members and close friends help. Family members may also benefit from counseling.\n\nPerhaps a neurosurgeon could better diagnose your condition.  A trauma spinal injury may be of several types (see source).  Your attorney should have their (doctor's) statements on file as it pertains to your particular case.  Contact organizations such as the Christopher Reeves Foundation to learn of advancements in spinal cord research.\n\nSome states have departments that specialize in Rehabilitation Services.  They offer training to those who qualify (and pending funding availability).  They test to determine areas of interest and types of work that you can do.  They often pay for education or training that will enable you to continue working.  Learning to do other work may enable you to continue working.  It would help prevent a sense of helplessness and depression due to lack of personal fulfillment.  If your state offers Job Service, speaking with them about Rehabilitative Services may provide a name and telephone number to get things started.\n\nOften physical therapy is part of spinal injury treatment.  One should be careful not to irritate the injury site or create further damage.  If disability was denied on two separate occassions, they probably feel certain of your ability to work.  They, too, may be able to refer you to services designed to help in your recovery from your injury.	health

What is the perfect time to work out on a treadmill for?? You would think the longer the better right??? But ive heard that you only really need 30-45mins a day, any longer isnt really achieving anything more. Im just curious as to if thats true or not. Im not HUGELY overweight, but im very unfit. When i finish on the treadmill my face stays bright red for at least 30 mins. I can handle a very fast walking speed but jogging is so hard, i feel like im going to die! But i jogged anyway for a couple of minutes until i made myself sick from it. Now i stick to the level under that, a very fast walk. \nAny ideas or suggestions about the perfect amount of time to work out for and what to do when im on there? First of all, you can't exercise "too long". It depends on what your objectives are. If you stay longer than 40 mins on the treadmill, you're losing more fat and building up more endurance. If you stay on for 30-45 mins, that's a good time for people who just want to lose weight and keep in shape. After 30 mins, you start burning fat instead of just calories. So the longer you stay on, the more fat you're burning. People who train for marathons and races definitely stay longer than 45 mins! \nBut in your case, I think 30-45 mins is a great time to start off with. And don't worry, my face also gets extremely flushed after working out, this has nothing to do with your level of fitness.\nYou will see that the longer you stick with it, the better your overall fitness will become, and eventually you can start jogging. I can also recommend that you perhaps try the uphill mode on the treadmill - it'll burn more calories and tone your butt as well. So, I think you should keep up the brisk walk for now, and start jogging whenever you're ready for it (and you will be). However, if you really don't like jogging, just keep walking. It definitely puts less stress on your knees and as long as you're exercising, there's nothing wrong with walking! The key is to work up a sweat and get your heart rate up.	health

I have a gum infection coz my wisdom tooth is impacted. Can gum infection be treated without tooth extraction?

I am HIV+. Does that mean that it is impossible for me to have children via natural means?  I'm in my 30s. I am HIV+. Does that mean that it is impossible for me to have children via natural means?  What risks would there be to my partner?  To the child? I am amazed by the amount of misinformation in the responses thus far.  Although statistics vary, current estimates are that between 15% and 35% of the time HIV will be perinatally passed from pregnant women to their children.\n\nThe rate of perinatal transmission among babies studied since 1986 by the NYC-based maternal transmission study is 28%, which follows the rule that not every exposure leads to HIV infection. There is some evidence that transmission is more likely if the woman is HIV symptomatic, but asymptomatic women can also pass the virus to their children.\n\nInfants born to HIV positive women will test HIV antibody positive at birth due to passive immunity - being born with some of their mother's antibodies. As infants develop their own immune systems (including antibodies) they replace the passive immunity antibodies with their own antibodies.\n\nThis process is usually completed by 8-10 months of age, but not later than 15 months. Most medical practitioners use 18 months as the cut-off point for a definitive antibody test result.\n\nBottom Line:\nThere is no way for a male to infect a fetus directly. However, every sexual encounter you have while attempting to impregnate a women increases her risk of contracting HIV from you. If she becomes infected then there is a chance 15-30% chance that she may transmit it to her fetus. Regardless, if you plan on having children, both you and your partner need to have serious discussions with experts in the field of HIV medicine.	health
When working out do I eat lots of protein after OR before hand?? I drink weight gainer and eat a LOT of protein...should I take it right before or right after working out? before and after would be best.  also having something about an hour or two before bed is good as well...you dont want anything fatty just something packed with protein like tuna w/ water (right out of the can) because when your body is at rest that is when it also repairs itself.  try to make sure you give your body time off and plenty of rest otherwise the muscles do not have to time to repair and grow...hope that helps!	health
What can a person drink or eat to act as natural mucolytic to help alleviate sinusitis?  I assume we're talking about chronic stuffiness, right?  If so, I find that, in my personal experience, it's not so much what I eat as it is what I avoid.\n\nIf you were my client, I'd suggest that you keep a food diary for a couple of weeks and see if you spot any patterns.  Common foods that cause stuffiness include refined starches, rice and dairy.  (A plate of spaghetti will do it to me every time!)\n\nBest wishes.	health
is it normal for a woman to urinate when climaxing?  I would say it is not common for woman to urinate during a climax. What you might think is urination, could be an orgasm. Some females will squirt during their orgasm, but this is usually about 5-10 ml. Some maybe a little more, but not much. If you are passing more than say a big table spoon then you need to go and get checked out by your doctor. \n\nWeak bladder can cause this, but like I said, its not common. Hope this helps out, kind of hard to diagnose over the Internet cause lab tests and exams are a key part of it.	health
More information about radiation and chemo treatments together?  Not real sure what you're looking for, but yes, they sometimes go together.

can chlamydia be transmitted through saliva from an infected woman to an uninfected male through oral sex?  If the woman's infection is in her throat, then it can me transmissible via fellatio, but this is rare because chlamydia has a moderately-sized infectious dose. A certain minimum of bacteria have to move from the throat to the urethra. Biologically, men do have less ability to pick up infection as insertive partners compared to women who receive (into the pharynx or into the vagina).\n\nSo it's difficult for this to happen, but not negligible. Always use a flavored condom during fellatio.	health
What are chances of pregnancy once a fallopian tube & 1 ovary removed..plus D&C? She has had severe indometriosis this was cleaned up also. The chances are still good that she will get pregnant. The concern would be more if she will successfully carry a pregnancy. Once women get scarred with things such as endometriosis or infections, they are more likely to have ectopic pregnancies (pregnancies that happen outside the uterus). These are pregnancies which can not be sustained as they will do severe harm to the mother, even death if untreated. And the pregnancy would not survive past the first few weeks anyway. I am not saying she will have this problem, but it is a possibility.	health

Anyone want to tell us if taking ecstasy helped them good or bad? If you experiemented with ecstasy, did it help or mess with your mind? Are you glad or regret taking it? There is no doubt that ecstasy feels good, but there is a price to pay. I work with drug addicts and they suffer from damaged immune systems, chills, fevers for no reason, depression, anxiety, infections, weight loss, memory loss, blurred vision because ecstasy stretches the eye muscles when they over-react to the drug, etc. Even 6 years after they stopped taking the drugs they experience these symptoms. Ecstasy messes your hormones around and damages the neurons in the brain and throws your brain chemicals out of balance. If you know of anyone who is suffering from these symptoms after using drugs, L-tyrosine capsules (a natural amino acid) helps to increase Dopamine in the brain (a natural chemical to help with depression and memory). It takes about 2 weeks to start working. It might help (but first speak to a doctor before taking supplements). People who used drugs lose their sharp thinking and don't feel the same as they did before they took it. I would stay away from drugs if you want to live a normal and fulfilling life and not suffer from mental/health problems later in life.	health

How do computers keep record of time even when they are Shut Down ?  computers store this information in a CMOS chip that uses a small battery to retain the information when the computer is shut off. \n\nCMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) is type of chip that consumes very little power; therefore, while the computer is turned off, the battery discharges very slowly. But the battery will totally discharge if you leave your computer turned off for a year or so. Even if you turn your computer on every day, the battery is designed to last only a couple of years. Occasionally a battery will fail prematurely. \n\nToday’s plug-and-play computers can detect most of the necessary settings, but if your CMOS battery is dead, your computer will not be able to retain the date and time. The computer will also lose any custom settings, for example, the boot sequence. If you set a password in CMOS, you may be locked out of the computer. If the CMOS battery does fail, you might receive the message "System Configuration Lost" when you start the computer. It would be wise to record all the CMOS settings as a precaution. \n\nTo record the CMOS settings, watch for an on-screen prompt when you first start your computer. The prompt tells you to press a key, usually the Del or F2, to enter CMOS. To enter the CMOS configuration utility, you have to press the indicated key while the message is on the screen. After the CMOS configuration screen appears, follow the instructions provided to page through all the screens and record all the settings. \n\nIf your computer loses its time setting overnight, the CMOS battery may not be holding a charge. The CMOS battery is located inside the case on the motherboard. Changing the battery is usually a job for a computer technician. In fact, a layman might not even be able to find the battery. \n\nIf you want to locate the CMOS battery in your computer, be aware that a static discharge from your hands can damage components inside the case. After taking proper precautions, open the case and look on the motherboard for a battery. If you have a diagram of your motherboard, locate the battery on the diagram first. \n\nDifferent motherboards use different types of batteries. The battery may be shaped like a barrel or a coin. Some motherboards use a component that resembles a chip which contains the CMOS and the battery (made by DALLAS or Benchmarq). Batteries come in different voltages, so make sure you get an exact replacement. \n\nSometimes the battery is mounted in a holder. Sometimes it is soldered to the motherboard. De-soldering and re-soldering a battery is usually a job for a computer technician. An inexperienced solderer can cause a lot of damage. If you want to try to do it yourself, first practice on an obsolete circuit board. You may change your mind. \n\nIf the CMOS battery has failed because it’s too old, this might be an opportunity to upgrade your motherboard. When upgrading a motherboard, the most important considerations are to make sure the new motherboard is the correct form factor for your case, and that the new motherboard has the correct bus connector slots for your expansion boards.	computers and internet

Program to find simple interest using class in C++? Please help me,i will give you 10 points.Please write the code of C++ using class I'd love to help you, but I'm not sure what you're looking for.  Part of the problem, perhaps, is that while I'm a good computer programmer with 12+ years programming in C++ I'm really lousy with finances and I'm not sure I could work out interest by hand.\n\nBut even if I could, it makes no sense to develop this as a class if you don't have either related functions or persistant data.  I can't envision this taking more than one function to implement unless you stretch it some.  But if you were to stretch it, try this:\n\nclass InterestCalculator\n{\npublic:\n   InterestCalculator()  {SetRate(0.05);}\n   void SetRate(double r) {Rate = r;}   //Add error checking here\n   double CalcInterest(double money, int months);\n\nprivate:\n   double Rate;\n};\n\nint main()\n{\nInterestCalculator calc;\n\ncalc.SetRate(0.10); //set rate to 10 percent;\n\ncout << "$500 for two years at a 10% rate has an interest of " << calc.CalcInterest(500, 24) << endl;\n}\n\nNow, that's a rather contrived solution, designed to use a class even where it makes little sense to do so.  I don't know if this helps or not. I've left the implementation of calculating the interest rate to you (as I said, I'm not sure how to do it even by hand).\n\nIf you have more information on what else the class should do so that it makes more sense as a class, modify your question here or shoot me an e-mail and I'll see what help I can be.\n\nGood luck.	computers and internet
I am paying for 6 Mb connection but every time I go to a speed test it says around 1.5 Mb/s.? What is the best way to see if I am getting what I pay for? Check once the contract with your ISP.

The disk looks clean and i dont see any deep scratches on it. does anyone know what i can do to fix this as its driving me mental lol First start with DVD Decrypter, because if the disc gives you read errors at this point, it's probably either too scratched/scuffed to copy or has a new copy protection scheme.\n\nUsually, if a DVD movie works with DVD decryper and gives no read errors, you should be able to burn the disc without a hitch.\n\nIf the disc completes in DVD Decrypter, then open the files in DVD shrink and it should work.	computers and internet

How to record  Internet  steaming audio broadcast? Many of these are using embeded Real Player or MS  Media Player. Try with Audacity which is free and can record soundcard outpout.\n\nHere is an how-to from Audacity wiki\n"With most Windows and Linux audio devices, it is possible to record whatever sound the computer is currently playing, including internet radio streams.\n\nIn the drop-down menu on Audacity's mixer toolbar, choose “Wave Out” or “Stereo Mix” as the input source. (The exact name may be different, depending on your computer's sound drivers.) When you press the Record button, Audacity will capture whatever sound is playing on your computer's speakers.\n\nIf this doesn't work on your computer, you can instead use a cable to connect your computer's “Line Out” (speaker) port to its “Line In” port, and use Audacity to record from Line In."	computers and internet

In fact, I've started to see either of those two behaving very strangely on my tower computer too.\n\nI can still get messenger windows (don't know if they're MSN or Windows Messenger windows) even though in the system tray, no Messenger is running.\n\nAnd just now, I have had a chat window pop up from someone trying to chat even though Messenger in the system tray is logged out and I need to log in to send anything!  In fact, the chat window I just mentioned says, "You cannot send a message because you are not logged in."\n\n\nFurther strange things:  in the past I've logged into Messenger only to have a popup window following saying, "You have been logged out of Messenger because you've logged in elsewhere" (or words to that effect) indicating that some background process was already logged in.\n\nI log out, and exit, the system tray Messenger to get on with work, but still get chat requests coming in !!

pat/nat translations? when they are used There is a common misconception about PAT and NAT.\n\nPAT\nThis is a many to one solution. In this situation you have multiple machines talking to one firewall and then the firewall talks to the destination machine with your information but with the firewall as the return address. The firewall then receives the information the passes it on to you with the received IP being the orginal distant end.\n\nNAT\nWith NAT you need to have multiple ARIN routable IPs assigned to the public side of the firewall. This allows your private IPs to pick up a public firewall IP and hold on to it when talking. This is what many companies do to protect their webservers. When they have multiple inside webservers with multiple inside IPs they program the firewall to point one outside IP to a specific inside IP.\n\nMost home routers from linksys and dlink use PAT but they just call it NAT since this is how everyone knows it.	computers and internet

Help me please. Do anyone know a free OLAP tool? I need to do a homework about some free On-Line Analytic Process tool, speaking about its characteristics, plataform, data bases accssesed.\nIt´s very very URGENT.\n\nThank you. i have very simple solution, i have pdf file for you, just simply contact me and receive it,\n\nhere is some data inside pdf file.\n\nOn-Line Analytic Processing\nWe shall now take up an important class of applications for integrated informa-\ntion systems, especially data warehouses. Companies and organizations create\na warehouse with a copy of large amounts of their available data and assign\nanalysts to query this warehouse for patterns or trends of importance to the or-\nganization. This activity, called OLAP (standing for On-Line Analytic Process-\ning and pronounced &#92;oh-lap"), generally involves highly complex queries that\nuse one or more aggregations. These queries are often termed OLAP queries\nor decision-support queries. Some examples will be given in Section 20.4.1; a\ntypical example is to search for products with increasing or decreasing overall\nsales.\nDecision-support queries used in OLAP applications typically examine very\nlarge amounts of data, even if the query results are small. In contrast, common\ndatabase operations, such as bank deposits or airline reservations, each touch\nonly a tiny portion of the database; the latter type of operation is often referred\nto as OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing, spoken &#92;oh-ell-tee-pee").\nRecently, new query-processing techniques have been developed that are\nespecially good at executing OLAP queries e�ectively. Furthermore, because of\nthe distinct nature of a certain class of OLAP queries, special forms of DBMS's\nhave been developed and marketed to support OLAP applications. The same\ntechnology is beginning to migrate to standard SQL systems, as well. We shall\ndiscuss the architecture of these systems in Section 20.5.\n20.4.1 OLAP Applications\nA commonOLAP application uses a warehouse of sales data. Major store chains\nwill accumulate terabytes of information representing every sale of every item\nat every store. Queries that aggregate sales into groups and identify signi�cant\ngroups can be of great use to the company in predicting future problems and\nopportunities.\nExample 20.27 : Suppose the Aardvark Automobile Co. builds a data ware-\nhouse to analyze sales of its cars. The schema for the warehouse might be:\nSales(serialNo, date, dealer, price)\nAutos(serialNo, model, color)\nDealers(name, city, state, phone)\nA typical decision-support query might examine sales on or after April 1, 2001\nto see how the recent average price per vehicle varies by state. Such a query is\nshown in Fig. 20.19.\nNotice how the query of Fig. 20.19 touches much of the data of the database,\nas it classi�es every recent Sales fact by the state of the dealer that sold it.\nIn contrast, common OLTP queries, such as &#92;�nd the price at which the auto\nwith serial number 123 was sold," would touch only a single tuple of the data.\n2\n20.4. ON-LINE ANALYTIC PROCESSING 1047\nWarehouses and OLAP\nThere are several reasons why data warehouses play an important role in\nOLAP applications. First, the warehouse may be necessary to organize\nand centralize corporate data in a way that supports OLAP queries; the\ndata may initially be scattered across many di�erent databases. But often\nmore important is the fact that OLAP queries, being complex and touch-\ning much of the data, take toomuch time to be executed in a transaction-\nprocessing system with high throughput requirements. OLAP queries of-\nten can be considered &#92;long transactions" in the sense of Section 19.7.\nLong transactions locking the entire database would shut down the\nordinary OLTP operations (e.g., recording new sales as they occur could\nnot be permitted if there were a concurrent OLAP query computing av-\nerage sales).

Is it true that realplayer version 10 can interfere with me sending pictures from my digital camera to my pc? because i can no longer upload from my kodax easyshare cx7300 or my hewlett packard DSC 220 ? And does anyone know how i can get these working again please? i have tried installing the software again but it isnt having any of it?????? HELP. I haven't had any trouble with realplayer, mediaplayer or any other program and my digital pictures.  I'd have a look for a virus first to see if this is upsetting your system - you'll have to reinstall if there are viruses abd they are removed - then i'd look at control panel, and admintration tools to see if your printer and digital camera are enabled.	computers and internet
Where can I find downloadable street fighter clips without using limewire, but can use for windows movie maker  I would suggest maybe www.putfile.com or even www.youtube.com.  I know on putfile if you view the source on the page and search (Ctrl-F) .wmv, you will be pulled to the actual URL of the clip.  From there you can download it.  I'm not sure if you can do that on www.youtube.com.  Check it out.\n\nALSO, if you use Mozilla Firefox then download "VideoDownloader" extension.  This allows you to download clips for example from youtube.	entertainment and Music
Need help finding a song (wasn't a hit).? I'm looking for a particular sexy song.  It was never a hit.  It's sung by a woman in a sexy voice.  It's NOT "Natural Woman," "You Make Me Feel Brand New," or "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing."  Think S-E-X-Y!  Much much much slower than any of the above songs.  I know it's been used a lot as background for sex scenes in movies, and I can't remember which ones.  This is driving me insane!  The first words in the song are "You make me feel."

Why do women go on Maury Povich and say they are 100 percent sure of the father, when obviously, they lied? and why do I watch this crap talk show anyway?  But seriously, if you had slept with two or more people, why would you make yourself look like an idiot and be like "im 150 percent sure he's the father", and then he's found not to be and you look awfully stupid.  Why can't they be truthful and say "i THINK you are the dad, but there's another possiblity".  And why do women sleep with so many men in a short enough period of time that they don't know who the dad is?  \nObviously, I'm bored today.  :) I always say that to my friend! By the women saying that they are 150% sure that he is the father instead of saying 100% sure should tell you right away that they don't have it all upstairs! I really can't stand when they go up to the picture and say " look at the eyes, look at the lips he/she looks just like him!

Anime Characters? Why do some people think that the characters in anime and manga books are hot? Jeeze people, they're drawings. Same for avatars on some web sites. They're fake. How can they be "hot" or "sexy"? Some people think characters in anime/manga are hot because they are ideal. Meaning that if we, as human beings, could have the guy/girl of our dreams they would be like the characters from our favorite anime/manga. Unfortunatly this isn't good because if we only look to our dream guy/girl we will miss out on meeting a great guy/girl in real life.

how do you play the guitar?  1. Get a half decent guitar. Don't learn on a cardboard box, it will put you off.\n\n2. Get a decent teacher. It's DEFINITELY worth the money. You can't learn any instrument properly from a video or book, no matter what it says on the cover. How's a book or video going to tell you that you haven't got it quite right?\n\n3. Practise regularly, daily if possible, for a decent length of time. 10 minutes twice a week will not make you a guitarist. Having said that, don't go mad and try to do 3 or 4 hours every time you practise, your brain stops absorbing new stuff after a while. 30 minutes is a good starting point, build it up from there.\n\n4. Expect it to take some time. You won't be out-playing Brian May in 6 months. It takes years of work and dedication.\n\n5. IT'S WORTH THE TIME! Playing an instrument is one of the most rewarding things you can learn.	entertainment and Music

What does everyone think about the Chris Daughtry Controversy? The version he sang of "Walk the Line" was originally done by a group called LIVE in 2001.  He let American think he made this song his own and the Judges commended him for "being himself"  What are your thoughts and opinions? I never heard it said that it was Chris' own arrangement of the song.  I don't think that Chris tried to pass it off as his own arrangement because just the week before he gave proper credit to the Red Hot Chili Peppers for doing a similar version of "Higher Ground". The judges just said that he knows what songs are right for his voice. There has been speculation as to whether Chris mentioned Live's version in the pre-performance monologue and that it was edited out.  I think it is getting completely blown out of proportion and I hope it doesn't hurt Chris' chances.  He is one of the best performers in the competition in my opinion.	entertainment and Music

Where are the real men who live for music? I would like to read your answers to questions about the industry, no matter what part of the world your in.\nLove for music is something that is deep with in. Please tel me question you. Email me crystalsingers@yahoo.com.au Please take a chance on me. Everthing will be private if you wish. Well, there are two different topics here:\n\n1) The music creation / artistic part of making music\n2) The music business itself (i.e., lawyers, labels,\ncontracts, profits, royalties, paychecks, etc).\n\nWell, obviously, creating the music is the rewarding part emotionally.  You get to create something from your imagination and also something that reflects your personality and give it to public listening.  This is the part that is also the most fun portion.  It should not be tied down by business rules.  But, in many cases it is.\n\nThe music business is, as is all other money making industries, just a business solely interested in making money.  So, as long as the music is popular and it continues to make money, that artist is at the top.  If that stops, then the artist becomes a has-been.  If the artist was industry created (like so many artists of today), then that person becomes a nobody as fast as they became a somebody.  Today, the music business is almost solely focused on piracy without regard to anything else.  They are so entranced by this issue that they have forgotten that they really need to provide quality music to the listening public.\n\nSo, because of the piracy issue, the music of today is really not that great.  Much of today's music is primarily created in the producer's mind and by the producers... hiring people solely to fill the roles (just as as a film might hire an actor).  In the past, a group of musicians would get together and create music and then be discovered.  Today, it's just the opposite.  Producers create the music up front and then find someone with the look and a reasonably decent voice to fill the role.  Rarely is commercial pop music actually created by talented musicians.  It's now almost solely created by a producer who then hires musicians to play the music to what was already written (requiring only musical instrument skill, but little, if any, writing talent).\n\nThe contractual part of the music industry is where most new artists get bitten hard.  If you're undiscovered, then they rope you in to signing a horrible contract with small amount of pay and lots of concert work.  So, you get little in the way of pay, but you do a lot of work for them (that you are contractually obligated to provide).  So, if you ever get into the position of signing a record contract, be careful to read the verbiage exactly (and have a lawyer that you have hired go over it with you).  Don't blindly sign it simply because you want a record deal.	entertainment and Music

Is anyone else utterly bored with mainstream porn? Bi-sexual porn is great. But mainstream porn is terribly boring and tired. The same old positions over and over again, no creativity at all. And how many money shots must a man see before he is completely disguisted by the robbing of a woman's dignity?\n\nCome on people, let's unite. Enough of this boring, uncreative, male dominated mainstream porn. Has anybody else had enough? That's the trouble with porn -- you get case-hardened pretty quickly.  Then everything seems bland, but you're addicted and so you seek something a bit more, a bit different.\n\nOn top of that, images get 'burned' into your brain, and emerge into your consciousness at inappropraite times -- like when you're having sex for real with a real living person -- and then it seems that you are uninventive, unoriginal and a poor second best to the porn.\n\nTake my advice, keep the porn at extremely softcore and do not let even that become a habit.  Instead get out and try to get as much social interaction as possible -- work, find a cure for cancer, have as much sex as you can.\n\nThe moment when you do not 'own' your own sex acts is a particularly sad point indeed.\n\nGet out man.  Now -- while the going's good...	entertainment and Music

Anyboby got any interesting info on Aquarius? If you can break it down to the day, January 25, that would be nice too.  I am just wondering if anybody has any new info that I don't know. Aquarius\nJanuary 21-February 19 \n"I Know"\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nPlanet: Uranus\n\nKey phrase: "I Know"\nSymbol: The Water Bearer\n\nQuality: Fixed\nElement: Air\n\nDuality: Masculine\nColor:  Electric Blue\nGem: Amethyst\n\nBody Part: Shins and Ankles\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nMany people get confused that Aquarius is a water sign, as it's symbol is the water bearer and the 'aqua' in the name. However, these people are most definitely air signs. They have a way with other people, they really do. If they're a bad Aquarius, they're good at manipulating. If they're a good Aquarius, they can really change the world and get things into motion. Another reason they are obviously not water signs is that they find extreme emotional displays as kind of a put-off. They say what they feel and that's it. There's usually nothing else behind it. If they're mad, they're mad and that's that. But if a cancer's mad, they're sad, too, they just won't say it. They're the people who want to say the right thing, and when you're done crying they'll go with you to kick the other guy's ass. They also have a tendency to make weird noises, be humming or fidget. They can't help it, however. And don't be offended if they just start talking in the middle of a sentence of yours, because it really isn't their fault they haven't been listening, as their minds WANDER. There is no doubt about that. I think every Aquarius could be diagnosed with ADD at one point or another. That's not to say that they can't be good listeners when interested, or when they know it's important. They're actually quite good at listening, when they focus on it.\nAnd maybe it's just me, but I've noticed that they all have some tacky sentimental thing that they lugg around with them. My boyfriend Zak wears these shoes that are basically extra socks they're in such bad shape. But he loves them. And my mother had the same hat for 15 years. Christ.\nIt was no mistake when someone called Aquarius the 'banner carrier', as they are well known to start revolutions and reform. It even gets down to someone being picked on or a rather nasty over-the-shoulder comment being completely blown away by the Aquarius righteousness. They can't STAND to see the underdog picked on. They feel sorry for wounded puppies to whole nations of people. They're the one politely telling you that you're an asshole for making fun of the fat kid across the room. First they'll come in with the "Hey, you wouldn't like it if they did that to you" attitude, and if that doesn't work they'll come back with a "Fuck you" attitude.\nThey don't analyze as much as they reflect. And people naturally flock to them for advice. It isn't always advice the Aquarius will take themselves, however. They usually let people fuck them over or oppress them once or twice, but once they swear it off, it never happens again. The will these people have is incredible, and I think all of them are artistic in some way.\nThey LOVE to try new things, unless this aspect is outweighed by other signs in their chart, they'll also be the first person next to Pisces to say "Oh my god" after hearing some particularly heart wrenching tale from some victim. \nThey've all got a style all their own, and the house of a wealthy Aquarian would be a sight to behold. The other day I went to a restaurant in Baltimore, and let me tell you, my inner Capricorn fucking DIED. There were beat up mannequins on the ceiling, the walls, and they were painted weird, tacky colors and little army men were melted on as hair...and guh. The place looked like shit. And of course my friends loved it. Bastards. Anyway, I said that the owner HAD to be an aquarius, a	entertainment and Music

Please please please, what happened on desperate housewives?  Mrs. McCluskey has spread the word about Art, so when he shows up dressed as Santa Claus at the holiday block party the mothers won't let their children near him. \n\nLynette is on her cell phone, arranging a meeting with all the concerned mothers when Art's wheelchair-bound sister, Rebecca wheels herself over to tell Lynette that everyone's treating Art like a pariah because of her. She says she doesn't need this stress in her condition. Lynette is sorry but says she has her kids to think about. \n\nBut when Lynette goes to the meeting, she's alarmed to see they're making anti-pedophile signs for a protest outside Art's house. She tries to tell the women that they don't know anything for sure, but they won't listen to her. She and Tom watch the protest from their yard and Lynette says she knows it's all her fault. An ambulance arrives and they find out Rebecca has had a heart attack. As Art is leaving the house, a protester throws a rock that hits him in the head. Lynette tries to get the protesters to leave, but to no avail. \n\nLater that night, she finds Art packing and offers to help. She heard on the news that Rebecca died and she's feeling incredibly guilty. To her surprise, he thanks her. He says that because he had to look after Rebecca he always had to keep himself in check because he didn't want her to know the truth about him. But now that she's dead, he's free to do whatever he wants in a new town where no one knows him. Lynette backs away, horrified by what her actions set in motion. \n\nGabrielle and Vern want to dump a girl named Amy from their roster of beauty pageant contestants since she has no talent. But when Gabrielle lays eyes on her handsome father Bill, whose wife died a year ago, she offers to give Amy private tutoring instead. Amy sees Gabrielle flirting with her father and says she doesn't want her dating him. She already has a plan for Bill to marry her best friend Sheri's mother. Gabrielle seems to have met her match, but she turns Sheri, the most talented of their contestants, against Amy by saying she's planning on making them dance together in the show. With the girls' friendship over, she's free to move in on Bill. \n\nIan wants his parents to meet Susan and for her to make dinner for them. She confesses she's a horrible cook but he isn't satisfied until she promises to try to make them a nice roast. She asks Bree to help her out and she agrees, saying she's glad for the distraction since she just threw Orson out after finding out about his affair with the murdered Monique. She still believes Orson is innocent, but Susan is telling her that you have to face the facts, even if it's someone you love, when they see Mike being arrested. \n\nEdie visits Mike in jail to let him know she's dumping him. Susan is his next visitor. She tells him she knows he's innocent, even if he doesn't know that for sure himself. \n\nSusan arrives late for their weekly poker game and asks if Bree has told the police her suspicions about Orson yet. Bree cheerily informs here that her suspicions are gone now that Mike, who was previously convicted of a murder, has been arrested. The two women argue over who's more guilty, Mike or Orson, and an infuriated Susan heads for the door. She loudly slams the front door and only pretends to leave. She tiptoes back in and steals the key labeled "Orson's office." \n\nShe goes to the office and finds Orson there, watching a game and eating pizza. She's just starting her search when Bree arrives and she has to hide. Bree tells Orson she's there to take him back because Mike has been arrested for Monique's murder. But she says she still needs to know the whole truth from him. With Susan listening in, he confesses that he never loved Alma, but that his mother pushed them together and then Alma got pregnant, so he did the honorable thing and married her	entertainment and Music

Unique in the scale of genocide. Have you ever counted just one million of anything? Unique in that it could never happen again in such secrecy.

effects of inflation on a country's political and economic system? inflation effects interest rates, exchange rates, the cost of living and general confidence in a country's political and economic system Well, your additional comments kind answer your question. The thing with inflation is the next. Prices start going up, mainly caused by excess in demand, lets try to see it with a simple example. If prices of raw material go up, final distributors have to rise prices to obtain the same level of profit. Everyone can raise prices if they want, but what happens with the consumers. They can´t ask for a rise, they have annual contracts. So prices go up, income stays the same. Businesses have to close or turn down production. With less production, less people are employed. Less people employed, less income to spend and the thing becomes very critical. So economical system enters a recession or, if not treated correctly, a depression. Depression with inflation means high prices and little income to buy them... if you still got your job. Politically, central banks have 1 prioritary goal, which is to mantain the purchasing power of their currency. So when inflation is hiking up, central banks try to do anything to stop it. How? Raising intrest rates to stop investment and consumption, which will lower demand for goodsA more extreme measure, but rarely followed because of the political cost, would be a tighter fiscal policy,which in short states to rise taxation. The Us is right now trying to avoid, or cool down inflation, by hiking up intrest rates. So, for some 2 years, the political agenda has been a rise in intrest rates, when 10 years ago it was the other way around!\n\nHope that helps. Good luck!	business

Who started the concept of INSURANCE?  Early methods of transferring or distributing risk were practiced by Babylonian traders as long ago as the 2nd millennium BCE. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous Code of Hammurabi, c. 1750 BC and practiced by early Mediterranean sailing merchants. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen.\n\nA thousand years later, the inhabitants of Rhodes invented the concept of the 'general average'. Merchants whose goods were being shipped together would pay proportionally divided premium which would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during storm or sinkage.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans introduced the origins of health and life insurance c. 600 AD when they organized guilds called "benevolent societies" which acted to care for the families and funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the Middle Ages served a similar purpose. The Talmud deals with several aspects of insuring goods.\n\nInsurance became far more sophisticated in post-Renaissance Europe, and specialized varieties developed.\n\nToward the end of the seventeenth century, the growing importance of London as a centre for trade led to rising demand for marine insurance. In the late 1680s, Mr Edward Lloyd opened a coffee house which became a popular haunt of ship owners, merchants and ships’ captains, and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news. It became the meeting place for parties wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. Today, Lloyds of London remains the leading market for marine and other specialist types of insurance, but it works rather differently to the more familiar kinds of insurance. (See Lloyd's of London).\n\nInsurance as we know it today can be traced to the Great Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured 13,200 houses. In the aftermath of this disaster Nicholas Barbon opened an office to insure buildings. In 1680 he established England's first fire insurance company, "The Fire Office", to insure brick and frame homes.\n\nThe first insurance company in the United States provided fire insurance and was formed in Charles Town (modern-day Charleston), South Carolina, in 1732.\n\nBenjamin Franklin helped to popularize and make standard the practice of insurance, particularly against fire in the form of perpetual insurance. In 1752, he founded the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire. Franklin's company was the first to make contributions toward fire prevention. Not only did his company warn against certain fire hazards, it refused to insure certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great, such as all wooden houses.\n\nIn the United States, regulation of the insurance industry is highly Balkanized, with primary responsibility assumed by individual State insurance departments. Whereas insurance markets have become centralized nationally and internationally, State insurance commissioners operate individually, though at times in concert through a national insurance commissioner's organization. In recent years, some have called for a federal regulatory system for insurance similar to that of the banking industry.\n\nIn the State of New York, which has unique laws in keeping with its stature as a global business center, attorney general Eliot Spitzer has been in a unique position to grapple with major national insurance brokerages. Spitzer alleged that Marsh & McLennan steered business to insurance carriers based on the amount of contingent commissions that could be extracted from carriers, rather than basing decisions on whether carriers had the best deals for clients. Several of the largest commercial insurance brokerages have since stopped accepting contingent commissions and have adopted new business models.	business

why do people ask so many dumb questions online? I know there are dumb people out there but do you have to make things obvious.  I am not being mean.  Time is being wasted on non-essential questions and answers.  You are asking trivial questions, when there are so many important life issues.  For those that dont know, trivial means(wake up and smell the coffee and get a life)! I don't know the answer for sure, but I have to say that I find it very sad and disappointing.  \n\nI think it may have something to do with peoples need for a feeling of connection.  This can give them a bit of that, even if someone's answering a pointless question.  \n\nIf only there were a 'trivial question' filter, that would make Yahoo! Answers an utterly amazing place.	business

I sold my house in Phoenix 9 months ago and am renting as prices go down. How much longer should I wait to buy  Homes in Arizona (Tucson and Phoenix specifically) are sitting on the market longer these days.  Many forclosures will be coming on the market as people's adjustable rate mortgages keep rising and they can't make their monthly payments. I would say wait a year to get a good deal, but the drawback to that is that rates will be higher then. You'll have to do the math to see which is a better decision.	business
How Can I Get Positive Recognition At My Job? I am a part-time student and full-time secretary so life is a little hectic to begin with.  Anyway there are five secretary's and we are each supposed to have two counselors who give us letters, invoice, travel vouchers yada yada to type up.  I have two counselors but two of the other girls only have one.  When we received our evaluations mine wasnt bad but all its said was "Ms. *** does very good work" and on other people it was "Ms. ** does exceptional work"  or "great Teamwork!" and It annoys me because I know I do more than most of the secretaries here I have one counselor who has the largest caseload and one who has the highest number at the end of the fiscal year.  I am not the type to rub it in anybody's face but it depressed me and discouraged me when I seen my evaluation. Ask your counselors on a regular basis how you're doing and what you can do to improve your work for them.  Let them know you strive to be an exceptional employee and that you're open to suggestions.\n\nThat action there may be enough to push you up into the "exceptional" category.  I've seen it work.	business

how could i  make lots of money without investing any money?

You simply find someone who will bankroll you and your ideas - whether it is real estate investing or small business investing. All you need is chutzpah, lots of glib and a super great plan that can convince anyone to plunk in their dollars.\n\nDaniel Ludwig, one of the wealthiest men of the 20th century and owned one of the largest US shipping companies, built his fortune by using OPM http://www.powerhomebiz.com/Success/ludwig.htm\n\nThe book "Rich Dad's Advisors: OPM (Other People's Money): How to Attract Other People's Money for Your Investments-the Ultimate Leverage" By Michael A.

If this company is public and its stock is traded on a stock exchange, you can find its beta (vs. S&P500) on Yahoo! finance or other financial web sites.\n\nIf you are interested in its beta compared to some other indices, you will need to compare the stock's price movement over a long period of time to the specific index concerned.  Most finance/investment text book will teach that calculation.  \n\nIf this stock is not public, I don't think you can find a beta as it has no price history for the analysis.  Or you can pick another software company of similar size that is public and use its beta as a comparable.\n\nHope this helps.  Good luck.	business

Companies also \n\nstruggle with documentation , especially procedural.  \n\nSo , the cumputerisation not only costs money , but it cost human downtime , even waiting for the \n\ndepartmental heads to agree on "protocol".  There is a high degree of uncertainty on the ground.  \n\nAnd every departmental head has his own oppinion on what a computer is ,, but never the correct one , and is \n\nnot comfortable making a technical decision ,, as simple as a "safety" overide , whether to have or not. \n\nCurrent age , we have simply overloaded the human brain to handle the "manufactured" reality.  \n\nAlso , neither is the computer geek comfortable in the anlogue , in areas of technology rheo (plastics) , \n\nmaterial , machanical , or balancing the system Q , or machine Q , machine tuning in general , or anything \n\nthat considers the continuum. So , they won't caliberate the pH meters or the  set-up the strain gauge either , therefore they cannot caliberate !!\n\nSay , what you like , they are not comfortable with the legal aspects of caliberation.

Ebay shipping question for all you sellers:? I am selling new snowboarding equipment as a lot.  This includes pants, jacket, goggles, boots, bindings, helmet and the board.  If I ship to US only - what do you feel is a fair price for shipping? Is $150 too much for the lot?  I can't make it to the post office to weigh it before I have to post it.  Any suggestions? Put everything into a box.  Pack it just as you will be sending it and then to estimate the weight, first weigh yourself and then weigh yourself holding the box.  (Weight will be B - A) If it's more than 10 lbs you are going to be better off shipping by UPS or DHL.  They have websites you can go to and calculate shipping based on weight and dimensions of the box.  \nWhen you list it on eBay you can use a shipping calculator that will give your bidders their shipping cost based on the weight you enter and your location when they enter their location.  \n$150 sounds like too much to me, but it all depends on how much it all weighs and the size of the box.\nCheck my website for eBay selling help:\nhttp://www.themainsail.net/helppg.html\nI also have links for help with shipping and packing.\nGood luck.

if ponzi is illegal under the US jurisdiction, how come there the MLMs and Pyramid? If ponzi is what being claimed as illegal under the US jurisdiction, so how about MLMs and pyramid schemes. Cos i dun hav a very clear idea of how the SEC does their work as i was being scammed by one of the autosurf that claimed the SEC confisticated all their assets. As very much to our every day life are being influenced directly or indirectly by ponzi, from the banking industry to the social security. MLM is legal because there is actually a product involved.  It's basically where you buy something from a distributor and then distribute it to someone else who distributes it again, and so on.  Eventually someone buys and consumes the products.  It's similar to all normal commerce, but the reason nobody makes any money is that after a few levels, there are so many middlemen marking it up that there is no more room to price it much higher and actually sell it.  That's why they tell you to sell to friends and family, because they are more sympathetic and are willing to pay more to be nice.\n\nPonzi as I understand it just involves sending money to people, and then getting other people to send money to you AND the people above you for a few levels, and then those people get even more people to send money to them and you, etc.  There is no actual commerce involved, and it is mathematically guaranteed to fail after some number of levels.\n\n"Pyramid scheme" is usually used synonymously with the Ponzi scheme, and they are all illegal except for the Federal Reserve and Social Security systems.	business
how much of a loan could i get with nonestablished credit?  Based on my experience, it's probably not that much. I used to work in a bank and would review loan applications from people with little or no credit history. Your best bet is to get a co-signer with a good credit history to back the loan with you being the primary applicant but even with this approach you may still only qualify for up to a few thousand or less depending on your current income and other expenses. Although, even starting with just a few thousand it should be a good starting loan to establish some history for you. Keep in mind though that every lender has their own requirements but the more lenient they are you're probably paying for that with a much higher interest rate.	business

Say excuse me do you have a minute, I need to ask you a question, if it looks like they are doing something, in their own office, etc.\nDon't express your opinion about every little thing. Keep it to yourself. If you don't like something about the office, you can mention it to the supervisor but don't keep harping on it, they will get the message even though they might not do anything about it.\nA lot of communication can be done by e-mail, do whatever is your companys policy/protocol. Discussing things by e-mail with the group prior to a meeting can save time, also after a meeting to summarize, also a copy can go to the supervisor so they can see you are doing your job.	business

what is the current trend on platinum? this should have what its use will be As you probably know, it was mainly used only in high level electronics, especially in the aeronautics industry, until the widespread introduction of the catalytic converter where it is used as the catalyst to reduce smog components in automobile exhaust. This gives it quite an edge over other metals, a widespread application which actually uses up the material. However, its price in relation to gold has far outstripped its relative usage, and I think a lot of speculation is involved considering other possible applications such as fuel cells. I would expect increased demand through automotive applications for at least the next twelve years, by which time we may see some shift to new technology, but still at least level demand.	business

What do I need to do in order to start at home daycare?  The first step is to prepare a business plan. Even if you will not be applying for a bank loan, a business plan helps you to think through your business - what it needs, who it will benefit, how much it will cost, and what is its potential. Here are free business plans on childcare business that you may want to look into:\n\nhttp://www.sba.gov/library/pubs/mp-30.doc\nhttp://www.misbtdc.org/documents/BPWORKBK.pdf\nhttp://www.misbtdc.org/documents/CDCPLAN.pdf\nhttp://sbdcnet.utsa.edu/sbic/bplans.htm \n\nYou may want to read the free article "How To Start Your Own Day Care Center" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol40/daycare.htm It covers various aspects of starting and running a daycare center including the demand for daycare centers, how to start this business, shoestring strategies, how to operate a daycare center, tips on caring for the children, income potential, how to manage your daycare, marketing your business and other additional income potential. There are so many things to learn about the business that the first step is to read everything you can find.\n\nFor in-depth information, I suggest checking out the following books:\n\n- Start and Run a Profitable Home Day Care \n- The Daycare Provider's Workbook \n- Start Your Own At-Home Child Care Business \n- So You Want to Open a Profitable Child Care Center : \nEverything You Need to Know to Plan, Organize and Implement a Successful Program \n\nIt is also important that you learn the tax rules affecting daycare centers, especially if you are going to open one from your home. Here is the IRS page on child care centers: http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/industries/content/0,,id=99878,00.html\n\nAs for the licenses and requirements in your state, the Administration for Children and Families provide a state by state listing of contacts for licensing and regulations governing child care businesses:\nhttp://www.nccic.org/statedata/dirs/regoffic.html	business

aside from healthcare, what others careers are secure/stable?  The only stability you can find nowadays in a career is to be the best and most flexible performer that makes the business successfull.  Keep your skills current, always keep learning, and be ready to roll if your position gets changed or cut.\n\nGood places for stability are things like utilities (water, power, phone), food service (waitress, cook), home repair (contractor, carpenter), and other things that people need all the time.	business

who is george mason and \nwhy couldn't he stand \nup?  "George Mason (December 11, 1725 – October 7, 1792) was a United States patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. He has been called the "Father of the Bill of Rights".\n\nMason wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which detailed specific rights of citizens. He was later a leader of those who pressed for the addition of explicitly stated individual rights as part of the U.S. Constitution. His efforts eventually succeeded in convincing the Federalists (such as James Madison) to modify the Constitution and add the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments of the Constitution). The Bill of Rights is based on Mason's earlier Virginia Declaration of Rights. The French Revolution's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was also based on George Mason's work.\n\nAlthough a slave owner himself, Mason favored the abolition of slave trade, and withheld his name from the U.S. Constitution in part because it failed to do so."\n\n"He and his wife had twelve children, nine of whom survived to adulthood."\n\n\nSo either he couldn't stand up because he was dead, or when he was alive, because he was having so much sex.	business

I need to know what war is.? Like about Freedom's Challenge.........uhhhhhhhh.......PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!Please im begging you. War is a conflict involving use of weapons and physical force by states or other large-scale groups, coinciding with a lack of dialogue between the parties. Warring parties usually hold territory, which they can win or lose; and each has a leading person or organisation which can surrender, or collapse, thus ending the war. Wars are usually a series of military campaigns between two opposing sides involving a dispute over, amongst others issues, sovereignty, territory, resources, religion, or ideology. A war to liberate an occupied country is called a "war of liberation"; a war between internal factions within a state is a civil war. Until the end of World War II, participants usually issued formal declarations of war.\n\nOther terms for war, often used euphemistically to circumvent limitations on war, include armed conflict, hostilities, and police action. A time when no formal war is taking place, although there may be international and internal tensions, is sometimes called peacetime or peace. However, some consider the definition of peace to be more complicated. Baruch Spinoza (1632–77) said, "Peace is not an absence of war, it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice."\n\nWar almost always results in many unnecessary deaths. In the wars and conflicts of the 20th century, an estimated 130–142 million people died, of which 51 million occurred after the end of World War II	politics and government
14 y/o stalker, part 2? Thanks for all the wonderfull answers and support for my first question about this! \nI was wondering if anyone thought that by filing a police report I would be making the situation worse? I'm a little afraid that his family or friends will get involved if we go to the police. I don't want to get anything else started, or make things worse for my daughter. I just want to make this go away. Has anyone else had a problem with a stalker before? If so, how did you handle it? I checked out your previous question and WOW!  I would say you definitely have a problem.  I know how emotional and vindictive teens can be so I completely understand your dilemma.  When it comes to your children's safety, I would rather err on the side of caution!  Think of all the hormones and testosterone this young man has running through his system...  if you were to only attack this situation half heartedly, you run the risk of simply embarrassing him and further enraging his already emotional state.  Obviously if he is stalking your daughter, he has little to no self control.  Think of a pissed off teen boy catching your daughter in a situation where she is alone or off guard.(walking home from school, on her way to a friends house...)  What is he capable of?  I would rather you never find out!  I would certainly go to the police and talk to someone involved in juvenile services.  His behavior is NOT normal and should be investigated.  It is entirely possible he needs a mental health eval and would benefit from some professional help.  Good Luck and God bless!	politics and government

Question for those who opposed pulling the plug on Terry Shiavo:? I looked at the court documents and discovered that, after reviewing the evidence from BOTH sides (as scant as it was), the court found that pulling the plug would have been Terry's wish.  So my question is:\n\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE ABLE TO REQUEST WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR OWN LIFE-SUSTAINING PROCEDURES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES? the whole thing could have been avoided with a living will but that being said the investigation into her collapse and coma was not properly done. the fact is her husband was the only one who seemed to think she would have wanted to pull the plug, despite her strong catholic beliefs which clearly are otherwise. i find it strange that on at least two occasions he tried to 'pull the plug' and it was reinserted. the problem with this case is do you see a feeding tube as extraordinary care...now consider those who have had throat cancer, strokes, or any other condition that warrants a feeding tube. the other thing too is her family was willing to take on the financial and emotional burden of her life and he refused. why? why also did he purposely deny her own parents the right to see her before she ultimately died? i say that is cruel and considering there was no clear wish made by terry herself of her wishes it really came down to the word of her parents and her obvious religious beliefs and the word of her husband who had children with another woman and was living with her for over 10 yrs. why did he not just give full custody to her parents and family and move on with his life? one thing that out to be considered with removing the feeding tube...the husband thought that it was cruel to have her in the state she was in but removing the feeding tube and not allowing water or food is a horrendous death and not easy or peaceful. i am hopeful that the truth will come out one day and that her husband will be held accountable. he is not a nice guy and has a history of lying and cheating which leads me to believe he would no doubt lie to protect himself and lets face it, he had no love for her what he wanted was for her to die so that she couldn't ever talk and of course there is the book deal.	politics and government

will the problems in iraq ever be resolved? how do we get our soldiers home. can we win this war?  The problems in Iraq will be solved when the oppressed people of Islam seek a reformation of their own religion, and they can't do that unless there is a champion to help protect them from abuses.  The U.S. is doing that.  Our troops will never come home unless we seriously change the nature of the U.S.  First, we have to become isolationist, and hope the rest of the world doesn't go into a dark age.  Second, we have to train out children to be cowardly and uncaring, so that protecting our own interests and the interests of freedom and democracy go unnoticed around the globe.  Third, we have to silence the people who speak out about the wrongs conducted at an astonishing rate in other countries, and simply listen more to the people who say it is all our fault.\n\nWe can never win this war.  It will never end.  The enemy will just change names, change religions, change ethnicities, change ideologies.  The enemy is ignorance encouraged by "it's not my problem" as an attitude.\n\nAnd we'll always be there to fight it.  You keep speaking up.  Free speech is part of it.  Don't let me silence you, or anyone else silence you.  Free speech may make a liar out of me yet and maybe the rest of the world will join us in letting freedom ring.	politics and government

How can i as a minor become an adult at the age of 16?  You would need to be granted emancipation by a court.  \n\nEmancipation laws vary by state and not all states have an emancipation statute, which doesn’t mean that you can’t petition for it, because you can pretty ask the court for whatever you want, but in those states there is no actual ‘procedure’ in place.\n\nYou need to check the laws of your state. At a minimum you would be required to prove that you are capable of fully supporting yourself--paying for rent/utilities/food/medical expenses/etc with no assistance from anyone. You would also have to provide a *valid* reason that emancipation would be in your best interest. The court could require other things as well.\n\nThe court can deny emancipation for any reason that it sees fit, including, but not limited to, their belief that you lack the maturity/ability to function as an adult.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is not a quick or easy process, and more often than not, it is denied.	politics and government
from the  washington times maybe we should adopt their ilegal immigration policies go protest your own land? The Mexican solution\nFRANK J. GAFFNEY JR.\nBy Frank J. Gaffney, Jr.\nApril 4, 2006 \n\n\nThe Congress has received lots of free advice lately from Mexican government officials and illegal aliens waving Mexico's flag in mass demonstrations coast-to-coast. Most of it takes the form of bitter complaints about our actual or prospective treatment of immigrants from that country who have gotten into this one illegally -- or who aspire to do so. \n    If you think these critics are mad about U.S. immigration policy now, imagine how upset they would be if we adopted an approach far more radical than the bill they rail against that was adopted last year by the House of Representatives -- namely, the way Mexico treats illegal aliens. \n    In fact, as a just-published paper by the Center for Security Policy's J. Michael Waller ( www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/Mexicos_Glass_House.pdf) points out, under a constitution first adopted in 1917 and subsequently amended, Mexico deals harshly not only with illegal immigrants. It treats even legal immigrants, naturalized citizens and foreign investors in ways that would, by the standards of those who carp about U.S. immigration policy, have to be called "racist" and "xenophobic." \n    For example, according to an official translation published by the Organization of American States, the Mexican constitution includes the following restrictions: \n    • Pursuant to Article 33, "Foreigners may not in any way participate in the political affairs of the country." This ban applies, among other things, to participation in demonstrations and the expression of opinions in public about domestic politics like those much in evidence in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere in recent days. \n    • Equal employment rights are denied to immigrants, even legal ones. Article 32: "Mexicans shall have priority over foreigners under equality of circumstances for all classes of concessions and for all employment, positions or commissions of the Government in which the status of citizenship is not indispensable." \n    • Jobs for which Mexican citizenship is considered "indispensable" include, pursuant to Article 32, bans on foreigners, immigrants and even naturalized citizens of Mexico serving as military officers, Mexican-flagged ship and airline crew, and chiefs of seaports and airports. \n    Article 55 denies immigrants the right to become federal lawmakers. A Mexican congressman or senator must be "a Mexican citizen by birth." Article 91 further stipulates that immigrants may never aspire to become cabinet officers, as they are required to be Mexican by birth. Article 95 says the same about Supreme Court justices. \n    In accordance with Article 130, immigrants -- even legal ones -- may not become members of the clergy, either. \n    • Foreigners, to say nothing of illegal immigrants, are denied fundamental property rights. For example, Article 27 states, "Only Mexicans by birth or naturalization and Mexican companies have the right to acquire ownership of lands, waters and their appurtenances, or to obtain concessions for the exploitation of mines or of waters." \n    • Article 11 guarantees federal protection against "undesirable aliens resident in the country." What is more, private individuals are authorized to make citizen's arrests. Article 16 states, "In cases of flagrante delicto, any person may arrest the offender and his accomplices, turning them over without delay to the nearest authorities." In other words, Mexico grants its citizens the right to arrest illegal aliens and hand them over to police for prosecution. Imagine the Minutemen exercising such a right. \n    • The Mexican constitution states that foreigners -- not just illegal immigrants -- may be expelled for any reason and without due process. According to Article 33, "the Federal Executive shall have the exclusive power t wow and they say our new laws are racist and unfair. mexicans are descendants of immigrants and yet they have a lot of laws against foreigners and immigrants.	politics and government

If we were to invade Iran do you think that would touch off  W.W.3? none Maybe, but not by itself. Iran is a nobody on the world scene. People would scream and complain if the US invaded tomorrow, and the war would take even more troops away from other posts, but I really doubt it would get too much worse than it already is with Iraq. What Iran needs to start WW3 are some allies, especially if they're big, like, oh I dunno, Russia. Europe is also close enough to have a significant interest in what goes on in the region, but they're mostly interested in sorting out the messes in Africa.\n\nIf Russia or even a significant number of other Middle-Eastern or central Asian countries posted some of their military in Iran to physically protect it, they would all be drawn into an American invasion and the war would quickly spread. Also, the region is dangerous enough as is; Iran borders Pakistan, who like it's antagonistic neighbor India has nuclear weapons, and Isreal is also suspected of such. A major war enveloping the Middle East would likely touch off these sideshows too. Maybe China would take the opportunity to go for Taiwan while the US is too busy to look, and maybe North Korea will try moving south again. Who knows how far it could spread?	politics and government

psychologically; what made timothy mcveigh do it?  I think McVeigh was one of those people who are looking for validation.  Because he was a little strange, a little different, he didn't get that in the mainstream of society.  So, he got in with a bunch of kooks and he looked pretty normal and as a matter of fact he could stand out and be a leader in that group of right wing conspiracy kooks.  He was relatively smart and he was also very guliible at the same time.  He was perfect lacky for the nut jobs that he associated with.\n\nHe was a model soldier in the U.S. Army because he was gun ho and followed orders, never questioned authority.  But when he was rejected by the Green Berets because he failed their grueling physical tests, he lost faith.  This rejection devasted him.  It created anger toward the American government and military.  He channeled his anger into right wing extremist hate groups.  The very reasons which made him a great soldier for the Army then made him a solider for right wing hate groups.	politics and government

Requirements to vote...? Based on the premise that a person who pays taxes should have the right to vote regardless of age...\n\nOn election day should it be a requirement to produce your most recent pay stub and or W'2 along with a photo ID? \n\nWhy or why not? Standard requirements are to be 18 years of age, and either not have been convicted of a felony or to have had civil rights restored.  I cannot buy in to the notion that paying taxes should enable an underage person to vote, as this is not evidence of judgment or experience.  But I will offer the following idea for your consideration: each year, the IRS would publish the median amount of taxes paid; anyone who had paid that much or more -- or who elected to make an additional payment to cumulate to that amount, could vote.  Why? To keep people who earn less from voting goodies out of the pockets of people who pay more.  Such entitiement programs are becoming an increasing strain on the Treasury.	politics and government

Because when you send manufacturing jobs abroad, you stop and tear down the factories and stop training the labor force, and stop producing the capital goods needed to make the factory again and stop training the labor force to build those capital goods.. and so on. It's a long chain backwards: the supply chain. You don't have a supply chain anymore. Just like Africa. What you do have is money to buy the products from that supply chain.

He is an aristocrat, wealthy by birth, and his programs have done great harm to the poor of this country.\n\n8. Thousands of innocent civilians have died from American bombings.\n\nShould he be impeached? I hear this alot and it is more confusing to me than "matter of fact" like it is to some. No American is going to agree with every issue that comes before a President, so I don't really share your grand dilusion that I am going to get everything I want, or am deservent of it. \n\nYou talk like GW disrupted an illusionary "World Peace", which I think is very short sighted. These protester that scream for world peace don't understand the world we live in. There are people that hate us for no reason, in fact they come up with reasons to justify killing us, just like some of the stretches I have heard about GW. World peace today is not realistic, it would be nice, but its not going to happen. So, what do you want? A president that goes on the offencive to make sure you are still breathing tommorow, or one that will lay down and become introverted and selfish?\n\nBoth sides of the political arena have their talking points that are mostly crap to get you on their side and hate the other side. If you want to buy into this, thats your choice, but I have to believe you have a brain in your head somewhere...  you should use it.	politics and government
What occurred on this day in political history? On Nov. 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling for Palestine to be partitioned between Arabs and Jews. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1129.html#article\n\nOTHERS\n\n1952 President-elect Dwight D.

Then why doesn't the  Mexican government do something about their criminals trafficking humans if they care at all about Human Rights. Vincent Fox (Mexican president) doesn't want to do anything to discourage the human smuggling into the US because he depends on his citizens making it into the US to work and send money home to their relatives in Mexico, so the Mexican government doesn't have to look after their own citizens.	politics and government

Why do Liberals try to insult me by implying Im gay? Strange, I thought liberals were open-minded and would never stoop to gay bashing. I mean to imply that being gay is bad by trying to insult me with it seems like quite a contradiction. So, liberals step up. How can you be for gay rights if you commonly insult people by saying theyre gay. I'm a liberal.  I don't do that to people.  It's mean to insult people for being who they are.  Maybe the people you're referring to aren't necessarily liberals, maybe they're just jerks.	politics and government

why are americans so unbelievably ignorant about other countries?  I've thought about this one for years.\n\nMy theory is that, for the most part, especially those outside of major cities, Americans don't have to worry about other countries. Who is on our border? Canada? They're Americans! Mexico? They just send over tons of illegals! (Note: I personally don't think those last two things.) \n\nThe rest of the world seems far away and not terribly relevant. And, to be honest, for most Americans that is probably fairly accurate. Unless a local factory is moved to South Korea, why would anyone be concerned about South Korea?\n\nThis contrasts with other countries which are constantly reminded of the rest of the world. Small countries - like say the Baltic States - in particular have very good reasons for wondering if their big neighbors will plow through them. Even major European countries - Germany, Poland, France - are constantly reminded of their neighbors on TV, radio etc.\n\nThis sometimes leads to silly reactions in the US like "France is a traitor." Well, even if you think French policies hurt the US, France is still a western democracy and in NATO (more or less). Sometimes it seems that people are equating France with the Soviet Union. Get some perspective people!\n\nBack to the media point, American TV shows and movies are major exports around the world. Everyone gets a chance to see us (to the extent that Desperate Housewives and Charlie's Angels represent us). But how often do foreign shows end up in the US? Sure the British will show up on PBS, but more likely foreign shows are Americanized - from Big Brother to the Office. They even tried an American version of Faulty Towers once! (Staring Bea Arthur, forget the name of the show, it stunk and was quickly canceled.)\n\nOn top of this is the American ideal that we are the beacon of democracy in the world. In many respects this has been a good thing (Marshall Plan) but in other more recent foreign policy adventures - which shall remain nameless - it hasn't worked out so well. I think this gives us a superiority complex. And the worst part about it is, we have a pretty darn good country over all (there are major issues) and so that opinion isn't ridicilous.\n\nSo, basically I think it is because we are a big country, relatively isolated by geography, we have a superiority complex, and that we export culture, so most Americans don't need to know - and so don't care too much - about the rest of the world.	politics and government

Is this a permissible remedy under Title VII? The Union at ABC company has not permitted African Americans to become a part of its ranks because of opposition from union members. African American employees win when they sue to join the union. The court orders appropriate remedies. The union still resists African American as members. Eventually the court orders that the union admit a certain number of African Americans by a certain time or be held in contempt of court. The union is mandated to obey the court order to accept African-Americans otherwise it will be held in contempt.  Employees of ABC Company with the status of rank and file must all be admitted as union members no matter to what racial group they belong.  It is equality under the law.	politics and government

How many presidents have been in office in your lifetime? I was born in march of '76 so Johnson, Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and dubya I have seen twelve people serve in this capacity, eleven of whom were elected, one appointed.  That was Gerald Ford.  Six of these individuals were democrats, and six were republican.  Seven were president during a wartime situation, five were not.  Four of our wartime presidents were democrats and three were republicans.  A few skirmishes that ocurred, such as 'the bay of pigs', the 'Ghana rescue mission', are not identified here as wartime situations.  It is difficult to rate these men in order of effectiveness except to say that Franklin Delano Roosevelt stands out as an accomplish leader. He brought this nation out of a depression, he  was in office when social security began, and he guided this nation through WWII.  He showed courage and leadership when others cowered, and he did all this from a wheelchair.	politics and government
what is your opinion on sepeperate telangana state?  Till the country was divided on the basis of caste, religion and creed but now it seems that some greedy people are dividing India on the basis of boundries and regions. Is it not enough for these kind of people that they are living in a country, trying hard to feed over its 1 billion public. \nsome time, the sound of some like minded faces become so strong that it looks that it repersents the whole community.I am sure that if done a survey in Telangana region, the demand of any\nnew state would not a issue with majority of the people.\nfirst of all they want employment and resources. they have nothing to do with o old state or new state. \nTheir repersentatives should negotiate with the union govenrmnent for some economic and social assistance rather than screaming the demand for seperate state.\nManmohan Singh was quite right when he did not adhere to the demands of its local politican Rao, who was alliance Party for making UPA, for conferring Telgana a  seperate state. but for how long, the UPA would not oblidge his demand. I have had apprehension in the mind that perhaps the congress could grant it a status to meet its both ends near the 2009 general elections. \nIn my view,this demand would achieve nothing. it would not only augument the administration budget of government but surely would divide the nation and foment the similar demand in other parts of the country.\nI just put a simple example- we always say unity is the strengh but what we are thinking or doing- Just smashing and crushing that unity amidst some self-inflicted motives.\nIf that area has had some problems then it could be sorted out with a suitable planning. A layout or a rehablitation plan could be chalk out for bring back its prosperity.	politics and government

If a nuclear war happerned, but you weren't in an effected area would EMP still effect communication? For example the internet, CB radios etc.\nAny other facts about EMP would be good to, cheers!!!! Yes, due to the phone or transmission lines being impacted in the area of the blast.  Due to the nature of the grid system, however, the lines will be 're-routed' around the blast and should have you up in running in no time, that is, of course, if there are no other detonations elsewhere.  \n\nIt is also theoretically speculated that high enough kiloton yields at very high altitudes can have effects on the entire continent.  Since airborne tests were stopped in 1963, only computer simulations and theoretical projections have been made regarding the impact of the EMP.	politics and government

i need to get a visa for someone who lives in the Philippines to come here and marry me. where do i start?  Contrary to common sense, the quickest way is NOT to marry her in the Philippines. It is usually faster to get her a fiancee visa, and marry when she comes to U.S. (You have to check for the specific country though).\n\nTo start the process, you need to submit the I-129F petition for fiancee visa to the USCIS. The form is at: http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/i-129f.htm\n\nAfter this gets processed, your fiancee can go to a U.S. embassy for an visa interview.\n\nMarriage visa (K3) takes up to a year to process, while fiancee visa (K1) takes much less (~4 months from petition to visa issued in Bangkok, Thailand, different in different countries).\n\nNote that you also have a slightly more difficult/expensive, but potentially faster option of enrolling her in a U.S. college or English study program, and getting her a student visa (F1)	politics and government

Are there any theorist that still believe in Biological factors in crime or is.....? this a lost belief? To me it seems that in todays world, there could be no scientific proof that there exists biological determinism in anti-social or delinquent acts. Thoughts? actually, i think there is a biological factor.  for example, when i watch the news, child molesters look a certain way, and as we know looks are decided by genes (i also think personalities are partially gene affected).  certain looks are really the only common factor among these tiny balled freaks, so that leads me to think of a possibility of small biological factor.  however, this is no excuse for their actions.  everybody gets evil ideas, and most of us can easily override them and forget them in the same instant that they were conceived.  how they were raised and where they were raised also play major factors.  now im not a psychologist or a gene specialist.  in fact, im not even out of high school, so i could very well be wrong.	politics and government

Transnational companies are a great threat both for America and the world. A transnational company is one that feels no loyalty to any nation. They don’t pay any taxes to any government and they are strong enough to overthrow governments all over the world. For the time being they are using Americans. They threat America by the fact that if they draw their capital and investments from America 25 % of its population will be jobless. \n\nThe fight and the tension between the members of the Senate is in fact a fight between the American and non-American capital owners. Right after the 9/11 the nationalistic or loyal American capital owners became a little bit stronger and passed a decree from the senate to the effect that the central government and the states are to buy their weapons from NATIONAL war industries... But at present non-American capital owners have become stronger enough to sip petroleum out of Iraq by using American ARMY.

How many days was Jesus alive when he rose from the dead and did he actually walk around?  Of course he walked around, though I also hear he took the bus at times and also rode a bike, a Trek600 Mountain Bike for the rough rocky terrain. He was in great shape! I also hear he bought monthly passes for the metro to save some money in the long run.	society and culture

Is it ever appropriate to comment on someone's weight? My family has quite an obsession with weight... they're wondering if my friend will lose weight, or they're commenting on how thin I look now.  I'm very uncomfortable, even with "flattering" remarks... how can I respond? My family sounds just like your family. It's frustraoccasionallybe very upsetting. I just refuse to discuss any ones weight with them at all and I shut down any weight conversations they attempt with me - positive or negative - because I figure that if I seek their approval I also invite them to criticise.\n\nTo answer the other part of your question - I have occassionally been known to comment on people's weight.

what is the best dinner for 2 for valentines day?  It depends - do you cook? or are you wanting to go out? Out - my pick is Simply Fondue.  It's romantic with the high back booths for privacy, and cooking and eating out of the same pot leads to feeding each other, etc.  Cooking - I always go for steak - it always pleases a man - with a Bernaise sauce, and maybe a little seafood (in the sauce or on the side).  Finish with a chocolate dessert like a Chocolate Lava Cake with vanilla sauce or ice cream. There are plenty of cooking websites that can give you great recipes.	society and culture

What do you think about New Age?  New Age along with Buddhism is the only forms of spirituality that will survive the new world. \n\nThe way I understand it, New Age is a study of all forms of religion and spirituality. It doesn’t have a bunch of laws and regulations (even in modern Christianity the old laws of Leviticus are seen as a taboo). \n\nWell, this new form of faith has no laws and believe it or not it has no faith either, it only looks for the universal power of love and healing of the soul. \n\nSounds good to me. I think even an atheist that base their life and beliefs on facts would admit that a religion based on the unseen powers of the universe can be good. It is a scientific fact that meditation is good for your physical and mental wellbeing, so what if we add to those facts with more unseen truths that can be proven with the study of the human body? No doctrines or dogma just the true facts of life.	society and culture

If you went to "heaven" and found that even just ONE of your dearest, most cherished, most loved family members or people in your life (your mom, you dad, your child, your brother or sister, your best friend) didn't make it and was sent to hell to suffer for eternity -- would it still be heaven for you?  Could it still be heaven for anyone? Of course not, and it confuses me how any right-minded person could consider that kind of situation "heaven." I've also heard of a theory that God supposedly makes you forget about all your loved ones that are burning in Hell, but I don't see how that's any better.	society and culture

I kind of find some girls attractive, sexually... does it mean i am bisexual but yet to explore the other half of my sexuality? I came out 2 years ago as gay... would this mean I have to come out again but as bisexual?  One of my gay friends says I am bisexual because he's never experienced sexual feelings for a woman.

What should i Know about the Spiritualist belief of the element fire? What stone(s) should i use? I am interesting in knowing what kind of stone i need to focus my energies. I think you may be confusing things a little here.  You're really asking to very different questions without a purpose.  The Spiritualist movement of the early 20th century started out being about communicating with loved ones who had died.  Although some mediums were the genuine article (they could 'talk with the dead'), most were in it strictly for the money they got by fleecing wealthy and usually elderly women looking to talk with their dead husbands.  If you want an idea about this, rent the DVD "Ghost" with Whoopi Goldberg.  To the best of my knowledge, they do not hold a specific belief about 'elements', such as fire (or water, etc.).\n\nNow, if you want to focus your 'energies', that's another question all together.  You're not talking about 'stones', per say, you're really asking about crystals.  Again, the question is way too broad to even address here.  I've provided a link below that may illuminate you (only one of many online).  I HIGHLY recommend not 'playing' with things you don't know about.

Why the people are so cruel to the deaf people?  Ignorance and insecurity.  \n\nUnfortunately, many people in society are uncomfortable around anyone that's different from them.  So whether it's a different race, religion, style of clothing, or differently-abled, most "normal" people reinforce their sense of belonging and "superiority" by putting down those who are different.\n\nMany people also have little to no exposure to those with severe hearing loss, and therefore don't understand the culture, or that most deaf people have normal intelligence.  And be aware that when someone speaks a different language, the communication barrier is intimidating and often frustrating.  \n\nBut please don't think that ALL people are like that.  Especially in a one-on-one interaction, you'll find that most hearing people are kind and even curious enough to want to learn more about you and what your life is like.  But teasing most often occurs when people are in a group (and especially during the teenage years, when "fitting in" is perceived as a high priority).  \n\nBe proud of who you are and prove the ignorant people wrong by living your best life with dignity.

Why is it considered "sad" to enjoy alcoholic beverages on your own? I often enjoy a few ice cold beers after a long day at work, most of the time my girlfriend joins me, but when I'm alone, just watching a DVD and drinking a few drinks, why is it considered sad? I don't consider it sad.  sad would be drinking an entire 6-pack by yourself, making drunk phone calls, and then passing out and not remembering what the Hell you did before you passed out.  there's nothing wrong with enjoying a couple of cold beers to unwind at the end of the day.  it's when it becomes abusive that it's sad.	society and culture

20 somethings.talk to me? I attend a very liberal progressive Church. (The United Church of Christ) We are the ones that had the advertising that was banned from some major networks. (see site www.stillspeaking.com)\nI just went to a workshop where I learned that 80% of people in thier 20's do not attend Chruch. That number was staggering to me. Can you young people tell me why you don't go? Is it boring? Do you not feel welcome? I'd like to work on this with my local church. Give me you're ideas. What could I say or do that would help you feel welcome? And, how many of you have attended church in the past? What was missing for you? I don't go to church, even though I believ in God, and Jesus Christ, because I was tired of going to church and listening to people talk about how they are a better christian than someone else.  God is the only one who can judge us. All these people talking about how good they are... I don't need that.  Also, I feel that we need to read between the lines of many things in the bible.  Ways change.  Just because it was like 2000+ years ago, doesn't mean that it has to be that way now.  Many things in the bible are the way they are for societal reasons. Not because God "said so." The bible was written by men, and is then questionable. The easiest way to get people to do or not do something, is to make it "Holy Law." If I'm passing on, orally, the bible and I feel like saying you can't eat pigs, because I think they are dirty.  Whose to stop me from saying, "God, said this!"  If God is everywhere why do I have to go to church to worship Him?  Can't I go up to the mountains where I can see His work, and worship on my own there?  I have a beautiful wife and a baby boy.  I can see God's work right there.  I don't need to go to church have someone tell me, about His work.  Why am I going to give money to the church "for God?" God doesn't need money. Does anyone else think it odd that televangelists and some real preachers are driving around in Cadillacs and Mercedes', and BMWs?  While their "flock" drives clunkers. I know not all are like that, but you get my idea.   I believe in God.  I've lost faith in the church.	society and culture

A question for my fellow Christians? Do you believe non-Christians can be saved? I personally do. Please tell me why you believe non-Christians can or cannot be saved.  I appreciate all answers. I believe that it is arrogant to think we know the ways of the Creator.  To say who will or will not be saved by God is simply up to God, surely better company is to be had from a peaceful Buddhist than a whining self rightious door knocker.   The Bible says not to judge others lest we be judged.  I think that tells me more about who will be saved.  \nAlso, even if it tells us that the only way is through Jesus, It's not my job to limit the names, means, and ways, that God opens his paths.	society and culture

A monkey finds the coconut, puts his hand in the hole to grab the banana, but then can’t get it out because his closed hand is too big for the hole. Instead of letting go of the banana, the monkey stays there wrestling with the impossible and gets caught.’\nThe same thing happens in our own lives. The need to have a particular thing – often something small and useless – ends up making us prisoners of that need.""" My opinion is yes.	society and culture

who knows something about pentecostal ceremonies? i am looking for the words that would accompany the pentecostal footwashing ceremony, or, any links to where i can listen to a sermon given at a foot washing, or maybe watch one.  no kinky stuff - i am doing some research here; i genuinely want to understand or get a feel for how such a ceremony is conducted.  you can spare me the comments to on pentecostalism being a bunch of right wing whacko nutjobs.  maybe not, maybe so.  i'm not looking for a debate, just the 411, please... 1. Under the leadership of your Pastor or group leader, each\n   participating person writes his own name on a piece of paper which is\n   then put into a box, to be drawn. Participation should be voluntary,\n   but all Christians should be encouraged to participate.\n   \n   2. Then, each participant draws one name randomly from the box. This\n   is the name of his "footwash partner" for this ceremony. As each\n   person draws a name, he reads the name out loud and pairs off with his\n   footwash partner. People whose names have already been drawn will\n   already have a footwash partner, the person who drew their name, so\n   they will not draw a name from the box. If you draw your own name or\n   the name of someone who has already been paired off, discard that name\n   and draw another. Thus, all participants will be grouped into pairs.\n   Try to get an even number of participants in each ceremony, so no one\n   is left without a partner.\n   \n   Make no distinction by age, sex, or marital status. It should be a\n   pure random drawing, which represents the fact that all Christians are\n   entitled to give and receive foot washing to and from all other\n   Christians.\n   \n   3. Each participant should provide his own water, basin, and towel to\n   wash the feet of his footwash partner. (Optionally, the church or\n   worship group can provide these supplies.) Jesus makes no mention of\n   using soap or oil, so soap or oil are not needed.\n   \n   4. All the footwashing should be done at the same time, with the\n   person who did the drawing washing his partner's feet first, then\n   getting his own feet washed afterwards, by his partner. Once the\n   pairing-off is accomplished, the procedure should only take a few\n   minutes to do.\n   \n   5. A new drawing should be conducted for each footwashing ceremony, so\n   that the footwash partners are constantly being changed. It is\n   understood that this level of physical intimacy, conducted randomly\n   with fellow Christians, is not usual in modern life. Too bad. It\n   should be. It was clearly the Lord's intention that we should care\n   directly for each other's physical needs, as if they were our own.\n   \n   6. Before the footwashing begins, the Leader of the ceremony should\n   read the authorizing Scriptures, John 13:13-15, Then he\n   should pray a prayer similar to the following:\n\n     O Lord, we try to follow your commands, including Your command for\n     us to wash each other's feet. Please be with now as we demonstrate\n     our love for one another, as You have loved us. In Jesus' holy name\n     we pray, Amen.\n\n\n   6. The footwashing ceremony should be conducted with the same\n   frequency as Holy Communion, recommended at least once a month,\n   preferably each week or more frequently.\n   \n   May the Lord richly bless you as you try each day to live by His\n   commands.\n\n    Yours in Christ,\n\n     Bill McGinnis  <><\n     bmcgin@patriot.net\n     http://www.patriot.net/users/bmcgin/chapel.html\n          http://www.LoveAllPeople.org\n          http://www.InternetDailyChapel.org\n\n\n   Contact: bmcgin@patriot.net.	society and culture
Greek  or Roman God for "Shouting/Public Speaking" ? I would like to find out a god or mythological figure who shouted and spoke and (everyone or no-one) heard. Any relations to this theme is great! Thanks - I wouldn't know where to start looking. Bradley P got it half right, the Roman god Stentor was originated by the Greek legend Stentor who's shouting could beat the war cry of over 60 men, he challenged Hermes to a shouting contest, Hermes cheated and used the sounds of weapon clashing, volcanic eruptions, waves hitting the shore, and the sound of thunder, and against Stentor, Stentor lost, he was so upset by this he killed him self by stabbing a sword deep into his stomach, the name originated in Greek Mythology as a legend, the Roman took it in their mythology as a god	society and culture
For overseas Muslims, If I were to visit your country as an American citizen and a woman...? would I be required to wear Muslim dress and to cover my hair? (No offense, I'm just learning about Islam, not judging). In the movie "Not Without My Daughter", Sally Field was married to an Iranian man and was still an American citizen, yet she was nearly arrested by some very angry people because her bangs were showing. What would they do if I did not wear Muslim dress, even though I would be a foreigner. (Of course I would wear the customary dress out of respect for the Muslim people, their religion and their country, but I'm curious.) Also, how are American women who are married to a Muslim citizen of whichever Arab country treated? Obviously, we're not too popular overseas these days. Are they ever accepted into society? Hi Tina\nok Tina again it depend on what Muslim country you are going to visit? Muslem  come from diffirent contries,culture,educatons,\nfor example if you will visite Turkey or Tunisia...you can wear any thing you want....but it will be Saudi Arabia or Iran you have to cover your hair...\nfor example i life in Egypt...and about 9% of the Egyption people are Christian and they do not cover their hair and wear what they want and not all the Muslem women in Egypt cover their hair...and Egypt love the tourists coz they increase our national income so in the egyption beatchs and the historical places the touriste can wear any thing they want as they wear in theia contries...i will give you a sit for the Egyption Movies you can see how the egyption people wear in usual\nhttp://www.copticweb.com/aflam/Egyptian%20Arabic%20Movies.html	society and culture
Don't you think,the government shouldn't use my tax dollars to finance abortion if I'm pro-life? Shouldn't I have a discount? Why should I pay for programs that offend me? Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. Judgment belongs to the Lord. But, while you are looking for resolve to your question, do you believe it is right for the government to give Viagra to convicted felons? Is it right that we go into other countries and kill innocent people, because we believe they attacked our country? The people who stand and take an oath to serve the good of our citizens, take bribes to further their own financial well-being? That we can feed and send millions of dollars to other countries, yet every night we have thousands who remain homeless in America? Children who are hungry, cold, sick, yet we do not notice them?\n\nWe have many, many problems. Where do you start? Perhaps if the government would provide a decent education, proper nutrition, shelter and correct clothing, then we really could begin to make a change. Majority rules the good for many outweighs the good of the few, and until we bring that back into balance we will be plagued by social problems	society and culture

where is the original copy of the bible?  Actually, very few autographs (original copies) of ANY work older than about 300 years have survived.  We have no originals of the works of Aristotle, Homer, Plato, Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, or even Shakespeare.  Shakespeare died less than 400 years ago.  Yet scholars believe that the copies we have of all these works are accurate to the original.  There is NO ancient writting, however, that we are more sure of than the Bible.\n\nThe Old Testament was written between 1500 and 400 BC.  The earliest copies we have of the Old Testament date between 200 BC and 200 AD.  That means that some of our earliest copies might have been written 1700 years after the fact.  This sounds like there is a lot of time to make a lot of errors in copying.  If this was any other book, that would probably be true.  However, we know a great deal about HOW the Bible was copied.  First, we know that copies were not made very often.  We have records that tell us that books were only copied once every 300-400 years or so.  These copies were done by only the best scribes, and under very strict guidelines.  We have obtained checklists that a copy must go through before it can be used.  The checklists were along this order..."The 359th word is THE, the 78th letter on the 22nd page is L, the book contains 1294 words, etc."  If the copy did not pass all of the checklist items, it was redone.  This means that our copies of the Old Testament have probably not been copied more than 8 times, and in some cases, probably only once or twice, under the strictest guidelines imaginable.  This is a far cry off from the "telephone game" scenario that critics would like you to believe.\n\nThe New Testament is a bit different.  It was not copied under such strict guidelines, and it was copied over and over and over again.  We are not so assured of its accuracy based on the methods of copying.  However, we are assured of its accuracy because of the great number of manuscripts we have, the relatively short amount of time between these copies and the originals.  We have hundreds of manuscripts from the 1st and 2nd centuries, and thousands of manuscripts from the 3rd and 4th centuries.  We are able to compare all of these manuscripts to one another and determine where and when certain discrepencies arose.  There is only .5% of the New Testament that is of any real dispute, and none of those verses contain matters of doctrine that are not addressed in other areas of the New Testament.	society and culture

about wife keeping  pics & letters from many previous sex partners?  Your wife has low self-esteem and keeps them as a moral booster when she needs them.  Demanding that she throw them out would only cause more friction.  But, to be warned, she does have a very high probability of cheating on you to make herself feel more complete.  You need to reassure her that she is a complete woman (to not only you, but herself) and that she is everything that she needs to be.  Moreover, she needs to come to the conclusion that those pictures need to go.  That part of her life is over and she needs to move on.  But that choice must be hers or it will come back in a vicious way.	society and culture

Does anyone know any REALLY effective workouts for hockey?  Jumping Rope\nWorkout Suggestions- change workouts to include jumping with both feet, one foot, and alternating feet. Jump rope 2-4 times per week. Alternate between the following two workouts: \n\n1) Quick Bursts- 30-45 second intervals at the fastest tempo possible without breaking your rhythm, with 1 minute rests between each repetition. Try 3 sets of 3 reps. with a 2 minute rest between each set. \n\n2) Endurance- Jump 20 minutes at a moderated pace, alternating your foot patterns throughout the workout. Set goals of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes without a "miss". Jump with a walkman on, listening to your stereo, or while watching TV. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Primary: wrists, ankles, calves. Secondary: shoulders. SOFT FEET. \n\nInline Skating\nYour primary objective should be to reinforce correct skating techniques. Anytime you are in skates, hockey or inline, correct skating motions should be executed. This will develop good habits, not bad ones. Assuming you do this, enjoy a nice sunny day on your blades and remember to ALWAYS wear a helmet and sufficient protective equipment. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training and technical skills training. Train on your inline skates 2-3 times per week. To avoid dehydration and sun burn, skate in the morning or evening and drink plenty of fluids. Select a safe, newly paved surface. \n\n1) Distance Training- skate a 50% speed for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend. Try to find a route with changing scenery. \n\n2) Technical Skills Training- Work on your skating and puck control skills for 30-45 minutes. Create drills to develop your forward and backward strides, crossunders, turns, stickhandling, passing, and shooting. This is a mental workout, rather than a physical workout. The emphasis is on precise execution, not power or speed. Skills must be practiced at a learnable rate. Again, for technical skills training ideas and effective drills, call 1-800-320-7545 for our latest hockey skills training video. \n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\nSlideBoard Training\nA training tool widely used by international speedskaters and competitive hockey players to develop leg strength, correct striding, and to provide a challenging cardiovascular workout. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training, quick burst training, and technical skills training. Incorporate slide board workouts 2-3 times per week. \n\n1) Distance Training- stroke a 50% thrust for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend and a consistent head level. Swing your arms back and forth to involve your upper body and to finish the transfer of body weight. Adjust the slide board to a challenging length. \n\n2) Quick Burst Training- Adjust the board to a shorter length. Maintain controlled strides, pick up the tempo of your strides to approximately twice that of your distance training. Three sets of three 30 -45 second bursts at 80-90%. Rest 1 minute between reps and 2 minutes between sets. \n\n3) Technical Skills Training- Complete, explosive leg thrust and upper body control must be maintained throughout any workout involving striding motions. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\n\nRunning Steps/Stairs\nThis could very well be one of the best cross-training activities, one that simulates game-like situations, challenges you mentally and physically, and allows you to breathe fresh outside air on a nice summer day. Step training will develop explosive leg strength and quick burst speed. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Go to your local high school or stadium and run 2-4 sets of 3 reps, 1-2 times per week. Each repetition should involve a 20-30 second burst up the steps, with 45 second rest intervals between each rep. Concentrate on exploding off deep kneebend, swinging arms front to back, and maintaining a level head position. Change your step workouts to include running every other step, or using only 	sports

who thinks david(calimity )james should be in the england team? he is useless. I'd pick him if it came to a penalty shoot out - he's the best shot blocker in England - it's just the rest of goalkeeping (handling crosses, positioning at free kicks, getting caught out of his area etc) he's rubbish at.  He also has a better chance of actually scoring a penalty than many of the England outfield....	sports

I cycle a hybrid but want to switch to a proper road bike. Which would be a good, cheap entry level brand? I cycle in London and commute to work. But enjoy cycling fast!\nI'd like a bike that's basic, but good enough to upgrade later on.\nHopefully something not too stiff - south london roads are rough! I actually preferred a mountain bike with the narrowest semi-slick tyres I could find for riding regularly in London traffic, but thankfully I don't have to do this anymore. It looked strange with Marzocchi race forks, but had a good riding position, was fast, could jump over traffic islands and I never had an on-road accident on it in years of London (ab)use.\n\n Commuting just under 40 miles a day outside London, I used to mainly use an Italia fixed wheel machine from Condor in Grays Inn Road. This was practically maintainance free and very unattractive to thieves - the complete bike with aluminium frame and carbon forks should be around £600. This was also a wonderful bike for 50 mile training runs on a sunny spring morning and I even used it for youth hostelling.I had great fun on it until my knees gave out - and I'm not blaming that on the bike. The same frameset and forks with a Mirage groupset will cost around £800. A couple of clip on crud guards will make it more practical in British weather.\n\nF W Evans have several branches in South London and a huge stock of 2005 models at discounted prices. Check out http://www.evanscycles.com/ for details. They sell quality gear and the staff are enthusiastic and knowledgable - recommended.\n\nPersonally, I'd scour the ads in Cycling Weekly - I picked up a second hand pro level custom built cyclocross bike here for £500 at a time when the new frame and forks alone would have cost £650. Quality wheels plus Dura Ace and other top end components would have taken it way out of my price range new, but second hand it was cheaper than many entry level bikes. This has prooved to be an amazingly practical bike for everyday use with the addition of an USE suspension seatpost and using 32 mm tyres. There's plenty of clearance to fit clipon guards for road use in winter and it's an awesome tool for blasting down bridleways and canal towpaths in three seasons a year. Mine was made in 853 by a Manchester based firm called Atom.\n\nSteel will be more comfortable than aluminium and you can afford decent steel if you're buying second hand. Anything that fits you and has a Reynolds 531, 653 or 853 frame will be suitable, as would bikes using equivalent Italian steels from Deda or Columbus. The best all round compromise for speed, comfort and weather protection will be an audax bike. Anything by Chas Roberts, Bob Jackson, Brian Rourke or Condor is desirable and offerings from Mercian, Thorn, Ribble and Dawes are well worth investigating. Mine is a Condor which I bought new and there is no way I would want to part with it. It does everthing you want as long as you don't put much more than your wallet, passport, camera, keys, first aid kit and maps in the barbag - it gets twitchy on climbs when you're out of the saddle if you do. The only problem I've had is that the dynamo lighting system they fitted never did work, apart from in their workshop - I got so fed up with taking it in that I just gave up and scrapped it.\n\nI've just modified this after finishing training and hope it's of some small use. You know that whatever you choose is going to be the right choice. Just go for it and enjoy.	sports

who is marco van basten?  Marco van Basten\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\nMarco van Basten  \nFull name Marcel van Basten \nNickname(s) San Marco \nDate of birth October 31, 1964 \nPlace of birth Utrecht, Netherlands \nCurrent club Netherlands \nPosition Manager (former Striker) \nYouth club(s) \n1981-1982 Ajax Amsterdam \nProfessional club(s) \n1982-87\n1987-93 Ajax Amsterdam\nA.C. Milan 132 (127)\n147 (90) \nNational team \n1983-92 Netherlands 58 (24) \nManaged club(s) \n2003-2004\n2004- Ajax B\nNetherlands \nMarcel van Basten, known as Marco van Basten (October 31, 1964, Utrecht), is a former Dutch football player who played for Ajax Amsterdam and A.C. Milan in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is regarded as one of the finest strikers of all time and scored 276 goals in a career cut short by injury, known for his strength on the ball, his tactical awareness and spectacular volleys. His grace earned him the titles "San Marco" and "The Swan Of Utrecht". Van Basten, who was named European Footballer of the Year three times (1988, '89 and '92) and FIFA World Player of the Year (1992) is currently the coach of the Dutch national team.\n\n[edit]\nPlaying career\nVan Basten played very briefly for Elinkwijk before Ajax signed him. He played his first game for Ajax in April 1982 and was proclaimed the new Johan Cruijff.\n\nIn 1987 Silvio Berlusconi brought Van Basten to Milan along with fellow countrymen Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard, joining them in 1988. In his first season Milan won their first scudetto (league championship) in eight years, but Van Basten played only eleven games and was constantly troubled by an ankle injury. Despite this, in Euro 88 Van Basten showed a dazzling run of form, including three goals against England and a spectacular volley in the final against the Soviet Union.\n\nHelped by his form in international competition, Van Basten had an excellent season in 1988-89, winning European Footballer of the Year and scoring nineteen goals in Serie A as well as helping Milan demolish Steaua Bucharest to win the European Cup. In 1989-90 he was Capocannoniere (Serie A's leading goal scorer) and Milan defended their European Cup successfully. The Dutch national side had a very poor World Cup in 1990, finally going out to West Germany in the second round.\n\nMilan's 1990-91 European season was ruined in the semi-final against Olympique Marseille and the club received a year long ban from European football. Van Basten had been banned for four matches earlier in the competition following a cynical elbowing offense. Domestically the club's season was also disappointing and Sampdoria won the scudetto. Van Basten fell out with Milan's manager Arrigo Sacchi and Berlusconi sacked Sacchi to placate him. Undistracted by European football in 1991-92 and managed by Fabio Capello, Milan did not lose a single game in the league and won the championship, Van Basten scoring 25 goals and becoming Capocannoniere again. Internationally the Dutch went out of Euro 92 to Denmark in a penalty shootout, Van Basten missing one.\n\nMilan stretched their unbeaten run into the 1992-93 season, going 58 matches in total before they lost a game. Van Basten played exceptionally well in the early part of the season and was voted European Player of the Year for a third time before his troublesome ankle injury recurred in a game against Ancona. Van Basten underwent another in a series of operations and returned to Milan for the final few domestic games before they lost the Champions League final to Marseille. The final was Van Basten's final game for Milan; despite enormous effort, he was unable to recover from his injuries.\n\n[edit]\nCoaching career\nVan Basten officially left Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he eventually realized that football was too important for him and successfully took a course with the Royal Netherlands Footba	sports

Canseco , Bonds , Mcgwire? Lets Pretend all three of these guys are still playing .

Who would the fans be rooting for ? \n\nAnd if your first choice is Mcgwire ; doesnt race or ethnicity come to play here ? ( And dont tell me Mcgwire is clean ; if you think Bonds took Steroids why wouldnt you think Mcgwire did ) Well contrary to public opinion...I'd pick Bonds. First I'd like to say I'm from Atlanta and have never lived near or in California and I'm not a huge Giants fan. That being said, lets take Canseco out because he is a snake who is profiting on ratting out players for doing exactly what he did. I wish nothing good for Canseco! That being said it's down to McGuire and Bonds. Assuming they both took steroids(which is a pretty safe assumption) lets look at their raw numbers. Bonds has 7 MVPs, 8 gold glove awards, and 13 all star games...all while batting .300 and having over 500 stolen bases. McGuire on the other hand has 0 MVPs, 1 gold glove, and 12 all star appearances...all while batting .263 and having 12 stolen bases. \nWhile people may not like Bonds as much...I think he is a much better athlete the McGuire and I'd be rooting for him to beat Ruth over the other 2 guys.	sports

In volleyball van you catch/ receive the ball with your foot? Sometimes when your opponent spikes a ball you automatically catch it or receive it with your foot. Do you think this is allowed if you followed the national rules of volleball? You can never "catch" the ball, but in most levels of volleyball, you can contact the ball with any part of your body (including the foot).  \nThe only level that does not allow this is High School.  In HS volleyball, you can't contact the ball with any part of the body below the waist.	sports
Rutgers? are you serious? I've been hearing about how great Rutgers is before this Saturday. Frankly, I'm glad they've been outed, finally. Not to blow my own horn, but i predicted they would lose to Cincy and to WVU. Another person on here said they were better than OSU because they beat the only common opponent (Illinois) by a larger margin. OSU crushed Cincinnatti by the way. I just don't see why they were so hyped, when earlier in the year they only beat South Florida and North Carolina by two points each game. \nHow far do you think they will drop in the polls? My guess is 22, or 23. They have had a decent team for two years now and went to a bowl last year. You have to remember where they were only 3 years ago and where they are now: a Top 25 Team. Were they a little overraated at #7 (depending on which poll you believe) maybe but are they a legit Top 25 team: YES!!!!! And i'm no fan but they did beat Louisville which is no pushover. I think they will drop out of the top 10 but not as low as 22 . I say 14.	sports

Damon Huard - Probably your best bet.  I actually just picked him up in my league.  Playing really well as of late.\n\nDrew Bledsoe - Riding the bench right now.  Tony Romo took his job.\n\nAndrew Walter - Ummm....No.  You would probably get more points if you didn't play anyone.\n\nSeneca Wallace - Might not be a bad pick either.  Has better weapons than Huard, and more mobility.  And, Alexander is going to be out for another week, so they might end up throwing more.\n\nTrent Green - Concussion.  Going to be out at least one more week.\n\nJoey Harrington - Stay away from.  Has decent weapons in Miami, but no O-line to speak off.\n\nJohnson wouldn't be bad to stay with.  He doesn't put up great numbers, but he is solid.  Go with either Huard or Wallace.  Wallace has better receivers, but Huard will be able to work the play-action pass better with LJ in the backfield.	sports

how do i finish my bmx? ive built a bmx and finished it all, but then my chain kept falling off ,so a freind told me i need to replace the axle because the rear wheel wobled,  so i took the axle out.\nwould a mountain bike axle fit on to my bmx its a 20" frame?\nand what would you sudgest i do? cheers pete Pete,\n\nFirst, you need to make sure the chain tension is appropriate. you should be able to move the chain a half an inch up or down. \nIf there's too much slack, the chain will of course fall off if you hit any bumps. Try loosening up your rear wheel axle nuts and pulling back on the wheel. Don't forget to make sure the wheel is straight in the dropouts before you tighten the nuts again. Also, check to make sure the wheel has equal spacing up at the joints of the chain and seat stays. \n\nThis is the other issue. If your wheel is crooked, that means your cassette is crooked too, which would create sort of a twisting effect, causing the chain to pop off. Just make sure your wheel is as straight has possible, and the chain is relatively tight (half an inch of slack maximum), and you should be good. \n\nI wouldn't suggest putting a mountain bike axle in your hub. It's not going to be very cost-effective, and if your BMX bike is high-quality brand (not Next, Huffy, Magna, Vertical, etc...), chances are it has a 14 mm axle. The mountain bike axle won't fit in your dropouts correctly, which is a safety hazard, plus you could potentially damage your bike.\n\nIf none of this works, take a look at the teeth on both your rear cassette and your front chainring; if even one tooth is bent, that could cause your chain to fall off. Sometimes you can get lucky and bend the teeth back with a small pipe wrench, but in many cases the parts will need to be replaced.\n\nHope that helps some, Pete!	sports

Gymnastics Anyone?? does anyone like gymnastics?? i love bars and floor and i am in level 3 and i have 10 medals and 6 trophys!! if you answer this question and do gymnastics can you tell me what level and the amount of medals and trophys!! I am in level 4, have 12 medals & 12 trophy.\n\nGymnastics is a sport involving the performance of sequences of movements requiring physical strength, flexibility, and kinesthetic awareness, such as handsprings and handstands.\n\nIt developed from fitness and beauty practices used by the ancient Greeks, including skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. In ancient times the term implied exercise taken in the nude in the context of a gymnasium, a venue for intellectual and physical education.\n\nIt is often considered a dangerous sport, as the difficult acrobatic maneuvers often performed on equipment high above the ground puts the athlete at risk of serious injury.\n\nDisciplines\nModern gymnastics, as regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique incorporates six distinct disciplines:\n\nArtistic gymnastics (further classified as Men's Artistic Gymnastics and Women's Artistic Gymnastics) \nRhythmic gymnastics \nSports aerobics \nSports acrobatics \nTrampolining \nGeneral gymnastics \nPower Tumbling \n\nOf these disciplines, the two sub-disciplines of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics are the best known, having been part of Summer Olympic Games competitions. Individual Trampoline has been included in the Summer Olympics since 2000.\n\nThe discipline of rhythmic gymnastics is competed only by women (although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan, see Men's rhythmic gymnastics), and involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus — ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope — on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 20 points.\n\nSports aerobics  \nSports aerobics involves the performance of routines by individuals or pairs, emphasizing strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills. Routines are performed on a small floor area and generally last 60-90 seconds, being judged out of a total of 10 points. \n\nTrampolining  \nTrampolining consists of four events, individual, synchronized, double mini trampoline and power tumbling. Only individual trampoline is included in the Olympics. Individual routines involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten leaps without pauses during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial tumbling skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves. Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronicity. Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two moves are performed and the scores marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline. Tumbling involves a sprung track, athletes must perform a succession of tumbling moves and are marked on difficulty and execution.\n \nGeneral Gymnastics  \nGeneral gymnastics, sometimes called group gymnastics, enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance troupes of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may be all one gender or mixed. There are no age divisions in general gymnastics. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939. \n\nArtistic Gymnastics  \nArtistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's (MAG) and Women's Gymnastics (WAG), each group doing different events; Men compete on Vault, Parallel Bars, the Pommel Horse, the Rings, the High Bar, and on the Floor, while women compete on Floor, Uneven Bars, Vault, and Beam.

In your opinion: Which NHL team got the ugliest logo and colors? My vote goes for: Columbus Blue Jackets (even the name of the team lol) and Carolina Hurricanes (reminds me of a Tide laundry detergent box) Colors: The Ducks\nLogo: The Sabres\n\nAnd whoever said Chicago as the ugliest colors and/or logo, you have got to be kidding me. I hate the Blackhawks with a passion, but that logo/colors are the best in all of sports, no contest. I think ESPN voted it the best logo in all of sports. ESPN, for God sake's!	sports

Is it fair to drop Ganguli from Indian Cricket Team??  I dont think its fair because just bcoz of a short bad patch of form( those fights between coach and captain shud never be brought in front) earlier he is not being given the chance. How will u justify VRV Singhs place in the team without letting him play a one day match. He is one of the greatest batsman and its not easy to make 10000 runs in ODI`s. If you do think Ganguly is playing badly then please go out and try to hold the bat. We will see how many runs are being scored by you.\nP.S. He is playing well by the way	sports

What is best for Mike Sweeney's career? I'm a huge Royals fan and also a huge Mike Sweeney fan.He has played his whole career with the Royals and is known to be one of the nicest players in the game.This is the forth year in a row that he has spent significant time on the disabled list.He is signed through 2007.There has been talk of trying to trade him, making him some kind of coach, and even letting him just retire early.He is a huge fan favorite in Kansas City so what will be best for the fans and for him? Sweeney has been one of my favorites and was a permanent fixture on my fantasy team due to his talent and being one heck of a great guy.  Unfortunately he is also very fragile and is constantly acking with one thing or another.  I don't think many teams are willing to pay his price tag, and eventually will end up signing for a very low contract full of performance incentives or as a role (read bench) player.	sports
Do you guys think De la Hoya will actually retire "if" he loses? He was on Jay Leno Monday night and announced he would retire if he loses vs Mayorga. It's not the first time he said that and kept on fighting. Altought i don't think he will lose, will he really retire? I find it hard to believe that. If he lost to Mayorga, he would probably set a rematch for September 16th. He was looking forward to fighting Pretty Boy Floyd then, but how could he resist going out with a vengeance? ;D\n\nI do believe he's going to retire soon, but unless Mayorga finds a way to completely dominate Oscar (which I doubt), I see De la Hoya sticking to that one last fight he has planned.	sports

If you're in the UK, try Argos = £30+. But if you do put one up, be aware that the vandals will see it like a bull sees a red rag. They'll try to destroy it, whack it with a stick, spray paint it....\nYou can even connect it to your VCR and record what you're viewing, (which is great on hot summer nights when young lovers don't think any one is watching)	sports
