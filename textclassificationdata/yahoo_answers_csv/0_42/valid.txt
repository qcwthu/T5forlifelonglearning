have you tried Internet Explorer version 7 beta? has anyone tried this?...what do you think about it?.... Yes, tried it out for awhile.  It definitely has a more user friendly, cleaned up interface and has some neat functions -- you can "tab" your explorer windows in one window; saves space on your toolbar.  It does, however, cause conflicts with some sites that aren't compatible with it yet (H&R Block's online TaxCut program, for example).  Once the compatibility issues are resolved, it will definitely be worth it.	computers and internet

How can I create a boot floppy disk for Fedora Linux Core 5? I have a PC. The hard drive has two partitions. On one partition is Windows XP. On the other partition, I installed Fedora Linux Core 5. The boot loader automatically boots to Windows XP as I want it to. I did NOT install GRUB or any boot loader for Fedora Linux as I want to only boot to Fedora Linux when I insert the Fedora Linux boot floppy disk. Otherwise I prefer to boot directly to Windows without being prompted which OS I want to start.\n\nUsing the 5 Fedora Linux Core 5 CDs, how can I create a boot floppy that will boot to Linux? ...... If the five CDs don't have a raw image, is there a website I can go to download a Fedora Linux Core 5 boot image that I can write to a 3.5inch 1.44 MB floppy disk? I would suggest installing a boot loader!\nyou can get info on creating a boot disk from site "http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Distribution/Download". \nHope this helps.	computers and internet

Does anyone know how to replace the file rundill.32exe for windows 98? I accidently delated this file using DOS so there was no easy way to retrive it.  What does this file do?  From what I can determine it's some sort of drivers device. Without it, some of my computers systems don't work at all such as the command for printing.  I have to turn the computer off then on before I can print stuff.  I can't reload the software because it says I need this file. Rundll32.exe\nrundll32.exe is a process which executes DLL's and places their libraries into the memory, so they can be used more efficiently by applications.This program is important for the stable and secure running of your computer and should not be terminated\n\nDo you have your Win 98 os cd, if you have one\nClick the Start Menu\nClick 'Run'\nType sfc and click 'OK'\n\nWhen the System File Checker (SFC) opens, choose the option to extract a file. Specify the "Rundll32.exe" file. You will need to have access to a Windows 98 CD to extract it from. \n\nIf you don't have that cd then.\nYou can try windows update, auto patcher or service pack which are available for free.\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windows98/downloads/default.asp	computers and internet

What is the best computer software to use in order to back up computer data?    Please advise me.?  Well, i have been in this idea for more than 6 years..\n- Short story: is to compress my folders into RaR files, in this case no virus can attack it (It is unknown file type for most users) and win some space. I also made it to run once a month at a specific time using Windows Schedular, so it will generate a rar archive every 15th of month at 9:45 AM, since I am not at home at that time and don't need the computer.\n- Long story: WinRaR is a copression software, and needs some time to backup my 10 GB files every month, but it is worth it, as I started to save it to DVDs.\nAnd of course I tried backup software, like Nero Backup, but these softwares make another copy for my folder tree, and they generate a hard disk error once, so I go back to WinRaR.\nI tried Win backup, but it does not compress, so back to WinRaR.\n\ne-mail me for further info\n\nXLMan	computers and internet

La pression des medias sur l'équipe nationale est énorme, en témoignent les récentes affaires qui ont eu la tête de Sven Goran Eriksonn. \n\nLors de l'Euro 2004, l'Angleterre alignait probablement le meilleur milieu de terrain au Monde (un losange Gerrard-Lampard-Beckham-Scholes qui aurait fait rêver n'importe quel entraîneur) avec de belles pointes devant, ils n'ont pourtant pas réussi à passer les 1/4 de finale. \n\nTout ceci pour dire que, comme d'habitude, je vois bien l'Angleterre prometteuse par moments, irrésistibles à d'autres, et perdante à la fin !	sports

Taekwon Do & Kickboxing? At the moment i am doing TKD,im on my yellow tag, me and a friend (that doesnt go TKD) are thinking of joining the nearest kickboxing class, i would like to know if joining kickboxing as well as TKD would confuse my work in TKD.\nIf anybody has any info on what kickboxing does please post that too. thanks you probably would confuse the two. they are pretty different: fighting stance and technique\n\ntaekwondo- you kick with your foot and its normally a more snapping motion, kicks are more flashy require more flexibity and uses a good number of high kicks, different stances such as attention, ready, horse, forward, back etc..., have a lot of point sparring with pads\n\n\nkickboxing(thai)-you kick with your shin and its more of a twisting motion with your whole body, kicks are simpler, stance is in typical western boxing stance i guess you can count two traditional and southpaw, more full contact sparring\n\nby the way i dont necessarily think one is better than the other i personally enjoy kickboxing more; however any art can be very effictive \n\nmost people would say take kickboxing becuase it would be easier to learn and less flashy therefore easier to use in a fight, but a good number of moves in taekwondo you can pull off too\n\nso take the kickboxing class and see which one you like more and stick with that one and maybe later go back to the other one if you want.\n\noh by the way if you are into titles(which really dont mean much in a real fight) kickboxing doesnt have belts so after so many years you cant say im a black belt in kickboxing but you could in taekwondo	sports

why is it when I'm ill; i end up with loads of wax in my ears.?  just gone through the same thing. It  when your ill ie; a cold then its not  ear wax its a build up of Flem(snot) in your ear then the ear has to produce more ear wax to stop the Flem  from entering the ear where it may cause damage to the ear drum. That is the function of ear wax to stop dirt and dust etc from entering the ear canals. Blow your nose until you feel the pressure in your ears this will help relieve the blocked up feeling for a bit, also putting you head over  a bowl of hot water with a towel over you will help.	health

Is there a chance I have one too?  I have a really limited taste in foods and I tend to eat a lot when Im really hungry, in fact I could almost eat a whole pizza (8 slices) if im really starving, and sometimes I eat one or two huge meals a day without snacks.  Im not obese nor skinny- Im about 6'0'' 185-190.  Thanks!!!!!! Usually when people 'binge eat', they go to the bathroom and vomit the food so that they do not gain weight.  It is not a nice thing.  Perhaps that's why she is 'noticeably underweight' as you say.\n\nYou do not appear to be the same since you simply seem to have a healthy appetite or you love to eat, and plenty, too.  But your weight is normal for your height, and you don't mention any ailments or abnormalities.\n\nYou did not say if she had just one meal per day, only that she ate late at night, so it is a little difficult to determine anything further.\n\nShe does need help. though, and support.	health

% of time lost looking for something at office? Someone know serious study of how much time we loose in a week or in a year - maybe in a life :) looking for things we classed at the wrong place, papers we didn't class and so on...  (at work)\nThanks ! The typical principal or project manager spends from 150 to 250 hours per year looking for lost files and reports (electronic and paper). Even in a small firm this is a substantial loss. This time usually cannot be billed. If the average billing rate of the professional staff and management is $80/hour, this amounts to from $12,000 to $20,000 per year wasted per professional. Another way to view it is - Assuming the typical professional works 2080 hours per year then you are loosing from 7 percent to 12 percent potential chargeability just looking for "stuff". This is also valuable time you could spend generating more business.\nhttp://www.kfdata.com/IMPROVING%20YOUR%20BOTTOM%20LINE%20WITH%20CORPORATE%20MEMORY%20MANAGEMENT.htm	business

The speed of sound varies depending on the material it is travelling through, the pressure, altitude and temperature.\n\nOn the assumption you're talking about air and that you're at sea level under normal atmospheric conditions then 340m/s would be the speed at 14 degrees C and 330m/s would be the speed at minus 1 degree C - so they're both right.	science

Jackson is capital of which state?  Jackson is the capital and the largest city of the U.S. state of Mississippi. As of the 2000 census, the city's population was 184,256. As of July 1, 2005, the census estimates that the Jackson Metropolitan area (MSA), including its suburbs in Hinds, Rankin, Madison, Copiah, and Simpson counties, has a population of 522,580, more than one-sixth the population of the state. Jackson is one of the county seats of Hinds County; Raymond is the other county seat. Jackson is also a part of the Jackson - Yazoo City Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The city has self-styled itself as "The Best of the New South," and "The Bold New City." Frank Melton is the current mayor of Jackson. The city is home to the international headquarters of Phi Theta Kappa, an honor society for the students enrolled in two-year colleges.	science
Does anyone want to build  a robot with me? I kneed a programmer and somebody who knows what goes into robots, or someone who knows a lot about motors and how to get the most drive out of them without useing to much energy.  I have the idea/plans. So you want to know about building robots... There are a lot of people interested in that.  The best advice I can give you is to get in contact with others who are interested in the same thing.\n\nTry getting involved with this organization:\n  http://www.usfirst.org\nIf you are a high school student, then you can join a US First Robotics team at your school, or at another nearby school.  Or perhaps you could help to start such a team.\n\nIf you are an adult, then you can volunteer as an adult volunteer with a First Robotics team.  No previous experience is required, and you will learn a lot from the other volunteers.\n\nIf you are younger than high school age, then try this:\n  http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/flego.htm\nIt's another robotics program for younger students.	science

what are some equations for a quantrum? does anybody know something about transforming matter from one place to another? You mean quantum teleportation? I can point you to some layman's sites explaining how it works. . . Keep in mind, you are only teleporting the state of the "matter" (the experiments I am aware of only move photon states, though in principle you could apply them to electrons and protons), not the energy itself. Also, entangling macroscopic quantities of matter with some stream that could teleport its state (making a copy at the other end) is currently an intractable engineering problem.	science

Do worms know they are alive?  They have no cerebral cortex, what we commonly associate with a higher conscience. A higher conscience is what a human has, the big grey matter of the brain. & most scientists (a Philosophers) agree that this is where the seat of a person is. The "I" as it where. The voice in your head that says "oh, I'm alive", so; \nNo, probably not. but it depends if the cerebral cortex is where the "I" of a thing is.	science
Why is there an air buble in the injection Lovenox?  More to the point, to allow complete injection of the drug- When giving injections intraperatoneally or intramuscularly(in the gut or butt) we take a tiny bit of air into the syringe so that there isnt any drug left over-to make sure you have your full dose.  This isnt done in IV injection because of the (low) risk of air embolism blocking a vessel.\nBut, the first answerer was correct as well, and they got here first...	science

why is the sky blue?  The first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859.  He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red.  This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\n\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later.  He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles.  It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10.	science
Can someone explain to me the last few minutes of lost on the season finale(2nd season)?I didnt really get it? LOST What we found out tonight was that this entire show, from the beginning up through tonight, has been about one person.....DESMOND\n\nPenny's billionaire father is bank-rolling this Dharma Project. It has something to do with the giant magnet under the island. Penny knew about this experiment, but never knew which island.\n\nShe knew that Desmond was going to be in her father's "Around the World" boat race. She knew that the magnet would draw Desmond's boat to this particular island. Her father knew this also, since he was still seeking revenge on Desmond for never taking the bribe to stay away from Penny.\n\nPenny has had her team of scientists searching the planet for this magnetic anomoly. When Desmond turned the "fail safe" key, it started the electro-magnetic pulse which were picked up by Penny's scientists in the Artic. Now Penny knows where the island is, and will start looking for Desmond.\n\nThis whole show has been about the lost love between Penny and Desmond, and the revenge that Desmond and Penny's father seek upon each other....who knew??..:-)	entertainment and Music

how do you write a proposal for a television show? I need to learn how to write a proposal for a new television show and pitch it.  Any pointers, suggestions, or examples would be nice. Hey there.  I've been down this road before, and think I can help.  Let me start by saying that if this is for class, that's one thing.  If you plan to pitch to a network, it may seem blunt, but don't bother until you've worked on some shows and have enough credits that anyone at the network level will actually let you in a room.\n\nAlso... hear me, now... nobody buys the "idea" for a show.  You'd be surprised how many people think that their "idea" is worth something.  An idea is worth nothing until it's executed in a way that can be sold to and understood by the industry.\n\nIf you're planning to pitch a scripted series, you'll need a pilot script (full first episode script), a well-rehearsed two to five minute verbal presentation of your ideas, and a basic two or three season arc mapped out.  The network development folks will want to know that the idea is sustainable for multiple seasons.\n\nIn the reality genre, you'll need that two to five minute verbal presentation, but will also probably want to be able to share how long it'll take to shoot the series, what kind of budget you're talking about, and so on.\n\nIn either case, a newer writer will need to pair up with a showrunner in most cases in order to be taken seriously.  A showrunner is someone who's been in charge of a few shows in a supervisory capacity.  In my case, I was paired with a showrunner by my agency, who also represented the showrunner.  When we started going to networks, she had the clout that made the development execs think "well, if she's attached, it must be worth a listen."\n\nI don't want you to think I'm being a jerk about not taking an original series to network until you're more seasoned.  It's really just they way things work.  Nothing here just comes over the transom, and those walls are in place for a reason.\n\nDoom and gloom aside, please be sure to learn proper format when creating a spec script for television.  Final Draft software(www.finaldraft.com) can be a big help, but I'd suggest you just go to www.script-o-rama.com and download a few tv scripts so you can see what they really look like.  There is no straying from format --- it separates the writers from the hacks immediately.	entertainment and Music

Has Lady Macbeth ever had a child? As far as I know, infertility is a major theme in Macbeth by William Shakespeare. His deceitful and treacherous acts resut in a disaster and his "kingship" is "fruitless" and "infertile". This theme is emphasized when we learn that Macbeth has no child, and that Banquo's descendants are prophesied to be the kings after Macbeth. Macbeth also describes his crown to be "fruitless". Thus, I believe that Macbeth has no child: his marriage with Lady Macbeth is "fruitless", they are infertile. However, a couple of lines in the text are against these analyses, they somehow interfere with the other lines. Here are the lines (the speaker is Lady Macbeth): "...I have given suck, and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me." (Act 1,Scene 7). So, here comes the question: Has Lady Macbeth ever had a child? If she did, then does the theme of infertility lose its importance? Or a third possibility: Did the children die soon after birth, before they can be considered heir to the throne? This point has been argued back and forth.  Many people believe that the Macbeths had a child that died young creating resentment and helping to explain their lack of humanity towards other children.  On the other hand, a lady of Lady Macbeth's standing would not have served as wet-nurse to her own children so there is a lie implicit in this from the get go.  It is likely that the story of Macbeth as told at the time included more detail but so far scholars haven't seemed to be able to locate them.  \nDecide for yourself.  Lady Macbeth may simply be calling on her femininity as a reference without being literal.	education and reference

Not sure what you're looking for, but this is what I always do.  I call the patient from the waiting area by their last name.  Unless I know them personally, or they are a child.  As I walk them to the chair, I make sure nothing is on the floor or in their way.  I make sure the light is not down low where the patient might hit his head on it.  Move the instrument tray so he can sit without hitting it also.  The chair needs to be raised so it's not too low.  Older patients may have trouble squatting into it (and especially getting up from a dental chair that is down too low).  Place the napkin over their chest and make sure they are comfortable.

A "Quinceanera" – is a lavish event in celebration of a girl's 15th birthday. \nQuinceanera (the term refers both to the celebration and to the girl who has turned 15) is similar in concept to a debutante's "coming out party" in other countries. The celebration is a means of acknowledging that a young woman has reached sexual maturity and is now an adult, ready to assume additional family and social responsibilities. In addition, the celebration is intended to reaffirm religious faith, good morals, and the virtues of traditional family values.	education and reference

Actually, the more dependants you have, the more money you are offered, unless one partner makes so much that you don't qualify. Since you're not working, getting married would make you better off.\n\nAlso, schools have health clinics paid through fees. \n\nI'd go for it.

My cousin's bf cheated big time! She's taking it hard, what can I do? She recently moved out to her own place to keep down commotion. Well, he comes over to visit her and vice versa. The other morning he called and told her he was going home because he didn't feel well. She called him numerous times and his phone was off. She shows up at his house to check on him...he's "sick"...to find him putting on his clothes, while this chick is laying in the bed naked. They have been together off and on for four years. They weren't officially broken up and she has bent over backwards for this dude! How can I help? It is better that she knows now what he is really like.  If he really did love her he would have never cheated on her.  The only thing I know that you can do for sure is to offer moral support, and try to keep her mind off of what just went down.  But be sure you don't get in the middle of things.  I know that you don't want her to get her feelings hurt but I am telling you that if you get too involved in this situation you will live to regret it.  You might even get blamed for some of the things that happened even though you didn't have anything to do with it.  I know from personal experience from my best friend and then I said some bad things about someone who is now his wife.  A really has created a real burden and hardship on our friendship and we have been friends for a long long time.

I don't understand why it is a lesser offense if a family member sexually assaults than if a stranger does. I'm serious about this question.  Does anyone know why? I would agree with Loss Leader.  Your question assumes that what you've said is fact (that family members are punished less severely than "strangers") and I don't know that under the exact same circumstances, that's actually true. \n\nA 35 year old male who molests a fifteen year old female should be punished the same whether they are related or not.  If you know of two cases with the same fact pattern to demonstrate what you're saying is true, I'd be interested in hearing about them.  \n\nI would suggest that given family dynamics, it's entirely possible (in the above case, for example), the mother of the child may ask for a more lenient sentence, and it's even possible the victim would ask for a more lenient sentence.  I've certainly seen it happen myself...and obviously, I don't think it would happen for even a second if the suspect and victim weren't related.	politics and government

They believe they are going to destroy America, they don't think anyone can stop them, whether it's a Dem or a Repub.	politics and government
Why do US flags on soldier uniforms appear backwards when we can also read the name (so know it's not mirrored Why do American flags appear backwards on soldier uniforms the last few years at the same time we can read their names, so we know it's not just a mirrored image of the flag? It depends on the where it is being worn.  The flag is always worn as though it was advancing forward.  Because it should never be retreating.	politics and government
Oil companies are drilling on federal land for free.  Can someone explain this rationale? Then the price of crude exceeds $55/barrel, the oil companies can pump as much oil as they like out of federally-owned lands WITHOUT paying a penny of royalties to the government.  \n\nDoes this make sense? \n\nI've provided a link if anyone's interested.\n\nhttp://www.sierraclub.org/compass/2006/04/subsidizing-our-own-exploitation.asp It's because they donate millions to congressional campaigns. Congress doesn't give a shit about the American people, if they can do something to help their donors without it costing them their seat, they will.\n\nAs far as Republicans are concerned, anyghing that exposes the Government for screwing over the American people is Democratic propoganda, especially since the Republicans are the most corrupt.	politics and government
Lost speeding NIP letter, what should i do? Hi there,\n\nI recently got a NIP letter for a car i used to own, i sold the car to my Uncle a few weeks ago but didnt get round to transfering the ownership as its "family" not a stranger that bought the car.\n\nHe has now been caught speeding and I rightly received the notification. I filled the letter out with his details but misplaced it before sending it back.\n\nI dont want to get prosecuted for something i didnt do, does anyone know who i need to contact to submit the information please? I have thought about popping into my local police station but don't know what they are going to say.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nMany thanks. you need to get in touch with the DVLA to get another letter sent.... your registration will be enough for them to find it on comp.... then...... DONT confuse things, it doesnt matter who owns it legally, just fill the form in, and tell them that your uncle was driving at the time... its no problem.......\n\nTHEN GET THE DETAILS CHANGED TO HIS NAME AFTER....\n\ngood luck	politics and government

workers comp.? Is it leagal for my boss to fire me.I was injured at work and,his doctor won't let me return yet. so... he filled my position,& no longer needs me. "can he do that".\n   Any atterneys out there ?? In California, it would be illegal to fire someone for filng a claim for workers compensation.  I suspect there will be similar laws in other states, but you should an attorney in your state to find out for sure.  In California, the applicable statute is Labor Code Section 132a.\n\nThe tricky part for you is that the doctor doesn't seem to think you are ready to return to work.  There is nothing with hiring a temporary replacement worker, so you might still ba able to go back to work when the doctor releases you from work restrictions.	politics and government
Anyone out there in favor of the occupation of Iraq? Three good reasons to support war with Iraq:\n1. We are not technically at war with them, and we never were. We were in a conflict to start off with, and now we are in an occupation. \n2. Our occupation is the only thing keeping Iraq from a massive civil was betweent he Sunni and Shiite sects of Islam. If they had civil war, it would inevitably spread to all the middle east. This is bad for our oil intrests. \nSo, if you enjoy driving your car, and you appreciate all the gas it uses, support the occupation of Iraq. \n3. Part of the reason we went to Iraq was because Saddam Hussein was commiting genocide by attempting to kill the entire Iraqi population of Kurds, which are the minority. Because of several treaties signed after WWII, if genocide is being committed, the United States has to intervene. This is to prevent the Holocaust from happening again. \n\nI am curious to know the opinions of other, less informed people. WOW, LOOK EVERYONE LOOK!!!!\n\nLOOOOOOKK!!!\n\na smart perosn on yahoo!!!!!\n\nAMAZING!!!\n\n1 more thing, no matter what we were wrong about(and alot of our so called allies) it too late to go back now.	politics and government
is a broken tooth gbh or abh?  In UK law the distinction between what constitutes GBH and ABH is whether or not the skin has been broken. If it has then it is GBH. I suspect in this case there was perhaps more injuries than a broken tooth.\n\nI learnt this when on jury service years ago when a guy, who admittedly was more than a bit of a bad lad, was accused of, among other things, assaulting half a dozen cops in the back of a police van. The policemen's injuries consisted solely of knuckle injuries and the wounds broke the skin - that, after lots of legal deliberation, was deemed to be GBH.	politics and government
Spirits? God? orbs? I'm so confused trying not to believe!!!?

I do know dust and moisture can cause things looking like orbs.\nBut when there is a lot of orbs moving together there is a whoooooosh noise as it moving quickly.\nI'm sorry to say and dont want to offend anybody, but i dont beleive in God.\nBUT something i cant work out at the moment is something i cant explain.\nI have gone through all science possibilities to explian whats happening but just do not add up????? i do believe in God and also the paranormal\nbut this isnt a must .. you can believe in one without the other ... i cant tell you otherwise\nso perhaps if you seperate that thinking that one will lead to the other .. you may get on better with your paranormal research\nit seems that you are a logically minded person .. and that you have had quite a few things that you just cant find answers for without looking to the paranormal now\nand for someone who perhaps has been skeptical of this in the past ( which it sounds as though you have ) ... this must be quite shocking for you\nwell .... it happens ...\nthere are too many things out there that have no logical explaination for \nyou are right about the orbs being dust etc ... but not all are ( most are )\ni think perhaps if you looked into the society for psychical research .. you may enjoy it\nthey look at things skeptically until they can rule out " normal " explainions\nthis is a UK site but there are similar in the USA if need be\nhttp://www.spr.ac.uk/\nhappy searching xx	society and culture
So if you dont believe in Jesus Christ, does that mean you will go to hell? Well I mean think about it...IF you dont believe in God, then you dont believe in heaven/hell and all of that. yet again... it shouldnt matter if you believe in God or not, because I thought all humans were created equal, no one is better than anyone else we all make mistakes some worse than others but we all still make them and learn from them. dont get me wrong I believe in Jesus and God and Heaven and Hell. But I've always wondered if people say your going to hell because you stole something or made a mistake wouldnt that mean every single one of us would go to hell...because God said we are all equal. All people are equal in two senses, we have all sinned and deserve death (as the wages of sin is death)  and we are all of equal value to God.\n\nThat is why He sent Jesus to die for all of us.  It's not about who's worthy, because none of us are.  It's about who is willing to be humble before God and accept His terms of our surrender.  Which, incredibly, are His terms for our salvation.	society and culture
