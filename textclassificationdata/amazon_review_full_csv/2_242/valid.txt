ADC 720 Manual blood pressure monitor In my ignorance I didn't realize that an stethoscope is required to use this monitor and if used correctly it would take 2 people to get an accurate reading.Red faced I have donated the unit to a local community college where it will be given to a beginning nursing student.Advise others to research a bit before buying.	middle
Okay, But Not THAT Great Maybe its because I didn't see this movie until it had been out a few weeks. Everyone talked about the surprise ending. I figured out the "surprise" ending at the first of the movie. Also, this movie was dark and depressing. And I couldn't help thinking it was a Ghost wanna-be. Ghost was a much better movie. I read where Bruce Willis had turned down Ghost and always regretted it. I guess this was his Ghost.	middle
Worthy Effort! Johnny Farmer is another of the Mississipi Hills bluesmen discovered and signed by Fat Possum Records. When comparing him to some of the others, R.L. Burnside, CeDell Davis, Junior Kimbrough, Asie Payton, Jessie Mae Hemphill and T-Model Ford, for example, Farmer's performance falls a bit short. That however, does not, in any way, suggest that he is not worth listening to, because he is. Farmer's sound is quite raw armed with nothing more than an old guitar plugged directly into a small Peavy amplifier and a deep well socket on his pinky for a slide. The songs on this disc are all traditional numbers arranged and interpreted by Johnny Farmer. Because Farmer does not fancy himself as a musician, it is unlikely that he will ever be coaxed out of his trailer for a follow-up. As such, we will probably never know what he could do with some original material and some decent equipment. Overall, a decent effort from an impoverished bluesman.	middle
Good, But Seems More Like James Patterson Have been a fan of Mary Higgins Clark for more than 20 years. I really liked her earlier books, where average people were caught in a web of circumstances beyond their control. But lately she seems to be resorting to James Patterson-type sickos who give themselves weird names. She's still a great suspense writer, and her books are still like a bag of potato chips... you can't stop until you are finished. I recommend this book for a fast read with some good twists and turns...I just wish she'd go back to more believable plots (like THE CRADLE WILL FALL). If you are into books with plots that revolve around twins (as this one does), then Rosamond Smith's (aka Joyce Carol Oates') books are worth looking for (DOUBLE DELIGHT, LIVES OF THE TWINS, etc.). If you like more lighthearted suspense, with likable characters, no sickos, and villains who get their just desserts, try Steven Rigolosi's WHO GETS THE APARTMENT?	middle
OK I was expecting more music (Frank Sinatra) and perhaps a more responsible father. The acting was good.	middle
Enjoyable but a bit disappointing For me, the most realistic and enjoyable aspect of this book are the vivid descriptions of the landscape and the seasons. Rick Bass has an impressive familiarity with the natural world. The book is also populated by a number of interesting characters, and the plot is intriguing as well, though not entirely believable. I got distracted (and bored) reading Young Dudley's geology journals, and I just couldn't see a good reason for having it interrupt the narrative. Further distracting are some characters' behaviors which really stretch credulity, particularly over-the-top Dudley and overworked, "soulless" Matthew. I found this book to be alternately enjoyable and irritating. Not sure I'd recommend it.	middle

I returned it. There were a lot of classic vows and some more original, but this book was not very helpful for the wedding I was helping plan.Judith Johnson's "The Wedding Ceremony Planner: The Essential Guide to the Most Important Part of Your Wedding Day" was perfect for our needs, however. Everyone was raving about the beautiful cerermony =)	middle
Personal review; your experience may vary I do like the Mojo bars, even with some of their unfriendly ingredients (see Lara bars for better alternative). However, this is the least favorite of my flavors. Honey roasted nut and the like hit the spot much better. Like I point out in the title, this is personal taste. Good luck.	middle
Strong on facts, short on story This biography is a well written, comprehensive account of Twain's life. What is missing is a coherent, compelling life story or insightful interpretation of Twain's creative process.	middle
What Happened to The End? After reading Servant of the Bones, which I was disgusted by, I decided to give Rice one more try considering Memnoch was part of the vampire chronicles. The theme and plot were very interesting, and Rice's descriptive power shone through. Yet, when I got to the end I felt cheated. I was left feeling like someone had just stolen the last 100 pages of my copy. The book itself was very well written, but there was no real ending, and with this I was very dissapointed.	middle
ok My kids liked it.and would watch it over AND over.and never get tyred of it .so watch it ok. Kids approved	middle
Decent book This is a decent history of Camp Roberts. My father wrote one of the first history books of Camp Roberts, and it seems much of the material in this book was lifted from his book. My father was not acknowledged at all. Our family was a bit upset at first but realized that at least the work has gotten the word out about this treasure of military history. Worth reading. Better to visit the museum or the museum page and experience it first hand.	middle
It's an OK book if you have a good professor I used this textbook for two of my accounting courses (Advanced Accounting and Governmental Accounting). In both classes, we experienced numerous errors within the solutions. Some chapters are easier than others and others are just horribly constructed. In the governmental section of the text, examples are difficult to follow which makes answering exercises and problems that much more difficult to solve. Bottom line, your professor makes all the difference; if they know what they are doing, it makes learning it easier.	middle
Covers pretty well If you are in a hurry - this is a pretty good product. It's a wee bit "tacky" when applying (it definitely doesn't go on as easy as an actual moisturizer). Also - it has that "sunblock smell" to it - which kind of annoys me - but may not bother the "normal" person - ha ha.	middle
Smart, quick, and witty! Sure, Freud could have a field day with Olivia's love life - but, the story was intriguing and the verbal repertoire between characters was great fun to read. The author has a knack for getting the reader to empathize with multiple characters.	wonderful
Story telling at its best Chainfire is an excellent book. Terry Goodkind has mastered the art of bringing the reader into the story. Chainfire (like all of his novels) shows us all just how important being an individual actual is. In Chainfire Terry Goodkind masterfully guides us through the Sword of Truth world with the reader asking a very important question - who is Kahlen? We see how one individual effects the world.The emotional journey Terry takes you on is extreme. From sheer joy to unbelievable saddness to rightous anger to deep fear, Terry Goodkind gives you all.His characters are so believable that you don't think of them as characters in a novel but think of them as your friends.Terry Goodkind has two more novels to go in this series and we can see that he is setting them up to be excellent, awe-inspiring novels.The philosophy in his novels, that have been there from book one, is brilliantly and flawlessly depicted.In short, Terry Goodkind's novels make you want to live.	wonderful

A lovely Holiday Barbie At the last minute my daughter decided she wanted a Holiday Barbie. Since I like to shop online and did not want to spend much, I immediately went to Amazon to find one.

As a parent I've heard it a hundred times, and I don't mind! As a parent of two small children, anytime I can get them to listen to something suitable is a big bonus. This album is complex, dealing with subjects from love of parents to eating strange foods. The messages presented are positive, fun and musically diverse. Which explains why I don't mind hearing it over and over again!	wonderful
Great for the price As a consumer you should never ignore the advice of others as I did. It nearly cost me. As stated it's NOT a heavy duty cord it's kinda fragile so I had a hard time trying to fish it through the walls. I was unsuccessful in doing so. I then clamped it along the base of the floor and it didn't work the first time because I pinched the cord to tight. Once I loosened the claps it work perfectly. This is a good cord and the lengh is very long. Just handle it with care.	wonderful
What a GREAT set. I simply love this set. Good weight w/out being too heavy. I had purchased a set of 18/10 scoops which came with a complete set of rectangular spoons (including the pinch and others) Thinking I had made a great purchase, I couldn't wait for them to arrive. What a disappointment, the scoops were awkward and the spoons were too long. Leave it to Cuisipro to save my baking station. Not only do I love this set, I intend to purchase the Cuisipro odd sized cups and spoons as well as the 2 cup measure to complete my measuring needs. I'm also thinking about the Calphalon oval canisters (oval seems to work for me).	wonderful

I couldn't put it down! This is one of the best books I have ever read! The intricate plot with it's many twists and turns kept me riveted. The character developement was SO well done that I felt I was "in their heads". The description of the many action sequences was so masterfully done that I felt like I was living the story as I read it. The satire was subtle yet brilliant and many times I found myself laughing out loud. A perfect example of this was the hero's cunning way of manipulating his captor without appearing to do so. The many highs and lows that the characters experience left me wondering "what will happen next?". I HAD to read on to find out! In closing, I must concur with Heinlein and Van Vogt. This is a masterpiece. I recommend it to everyone, Sci-fi fan or not.	wonderful
Great figure! I got this figure for christmas. I previously got the Roto Legolas figure and was very pleased. Now I am also very happy with this figure! It has such great quality and likeness. He looks exactly like Aragorn, even has the evenstar! He has his sword and his dagger with him,ready for battle! These rotocast figures are so much better than the 12 inch collectors series. I hope they make a ton more of these rotocast figures! Thanks for reading my review	wonderful
What a score! I picked up this game and played it solid for 2 days in order to beat my boys 458. Gutted when I got 457 at one time but soldiered on and managed to get 716! Yep, seven hundred and 16. I think I got about 6 yahtzees and non-zero scored all categories. The last roll was to fill in my 6s which was unusual and I only got one in 3 rolls but apart from that I couldn't have done much better. I was so stoked! Great little package and so addictive. Everything you need is there and it also supports Jokers and subscore checking which is essential for when score attacking gets serious. A+	wonderful
At last I found them! I have been wearing these slippers, everyday, for 3 years! They are a blessing for my cold feet! Not to mention the durability. I just now realized the sole was broken almost in 1/2 from years of use. I was frantic when I looked and looked and could not find them.Today is my lucky day, I just ordered my second pair!	wonderful
excellent detail but incomplete This book is written by several experts and is essentially a compilation of individual articles, each of which is outstanding in the detail of the direction given. However, for a person seeking to make a particular bow, all 3 books of the series are needed and there is not an orderly progression. Just count on buying all three, reading them all, making decisions based on what you've learned, and then picking chapters to help you as you go along.	good
Good product Makes great coffee. Only a 10 cup carafe but very well made. Making espresso and foaming milk has been a learning experience. It takes such little water to make but there is usually some water left over in the reservoir so you have to make adjustments to your measurements. I've let the steam run out in an empty cup to allow the reservoir to empty completely. All in all a great product for the price.	good
energetic fun i watched a cadaver christmas earlier today. quite an entertaining movie. energetic, funny, and smartly aware of the tropes it satirizes. the three leads are hysterical, and i laughed out loud early and often. a modest zombie outbreak occurs on the campus of a small college, and it's up to the janitor, deposed police officer, and town drunk to solve the crisis. this delightful flick also contains a pretty graphic and funny necrophilia sequence. great camera work, also. the movie wisely scuffs up the print, a la grindhouse, to give the movie a seventies look, which, to me gives it instant cred and weight. highly recommended.	good
Huh I liked this book, but it did take a bit. It's an interesting view point to the end of the world as we know it. I like how we are placed in a world where things have clearly gone wrong yet there is no explanation... it just is. As I said, very interesting but slow at first, so give it a bit.	good
This Film Never Gets Old I watch this film at least once during each baseball season. I'm not an Indians fan. I simply love baseball, and as a fan, I appreciate many of the jokes. Also, as a sports writer for over a decade, there are some "inside baseball" jokes that have an amazing shelf life.	good
clear solutions large maple recipe box Liked the box, just too big for my needs. About half the size would have worked for me. I should have gotten out the ruler and checked the measurments! Nice box though!	good
Misleading presentation picture Unfortunately the picture shows some type of packaging and all I got was envelopes with the CD's. The information is very useful and helpful but I'm sure I could have bought this CD set used for much less instead of paying the Amazon premium.	good
Great Product! This is a great case. Note: The box contained 1 face plate, and 2 bottom case pieces (one for 30G the other for the 80G). I have had no problems with the case other than the headphone port. Yes, the port is great for headphones, but it will not fit my audio splitter, video out, or other 3.5mm cables. So...I had to shave a little bit of rubber off of the cables, no big deal. The click wheel protector is very responsive, and the protective plastic over the screen and the rest of the case is also strong. This is a great buy.	good
good sound and light weight The HS500 sound pretty good for wrap around headphones and they are very light weight... you can almost hardly knotice that they are there.My only problem with them is that after about an hour or so if your not carefull to put them on juuuust right they pinch your ear.It's a weird pinch tho because it only begins to hurt me after I take them off.But like I said, if you move them around a little and get them comfortable it really isn't to much of a problem.	good

Not too shabby! If it just had an integrated magnetic compass I would have gone 5 stars. I would not be afraid to layout a small construction project with this, but I would definatly take cross measurement and trig things out if it were going to be a small house. I see no problems for deck layout/leveling, plumbing, etc... Ok for map drafts, but not for survey if ownership or lawsuit issues might result. The very low price I paid was good for at LEAST one of the stars!	good
good for beginners great for the price, and great for beginners. there are better acoustic guitars out there, but this is good for its price range.	good
Solid, easy to use Overall the dictionary was fine. It was thorough enough to have many of the more esoteric theoretical terminology for translation. It is quite large and heavy, making it difficult to use at times. On the other hand it was limited in some of the jargon used by my particular scientific discipline, but then I know of any dictionary that does any better.	good
Good Product It has been very cold and rainy lately but on the sunny days...No Cats! in my backyard. I think the product is working. Someone completed a review by suggesting to use an old pill bottle with cotton. Fill the container ever so slightly and punch holes in the top of the cap /bottle and the scent will last longer. I would have given five stars but no instructions were included when I received the product.	good
Good Follow Up Effort I thoroughly enjoyed both Fear Nothing and Sieze the Night. In fact, I felt that the addition of the second novel added even more depth to the familiar characters that were introduced in the first.Christopher Snow has a rare impairment of the skin that makes it impossible to spend anytime exposed to ultraviolet rays, and so he must live in the night.Their small town, Moonlight Bay, is being over run by a government experiment gone bad. His friends, and un-naturally intelligent dog named Orson, his girlfriend Sasha, and long time bud Bobby are the only people remaining that can be trusted.I thought the combination of time travel and quantum mechanics theories was interesting, though Koontz could have delved a little deeper into the issues. But all in all I was very extertained.And for those of you who haven't read the first novel, there's no real need to. Koontz sufficiently catches us up on all that happened in the first book.	good
On my husband's behalf We have NEVER wrote a review but this shaver was so bad I wanted to hopefully save someone else some time and money & pain. He is not a person to complain or write reviews. So on his behalf here goes. Our daughter bought this Christmas of 2007. Not quite a year old. It has two major problems. Short and simple. For one, it yanks his hair out. He could always wax. Same pain but not an option for a man. Last but NOT least...it's very loud. He closes the bathroom door, turns the shower on and it's still loud. He is not new to electric shavers so yes he has tried to fix the problem. Not what you would expect for the money and less than a year old. Well, there is always this Christmas.	terrible
Ironbound Vampire Sucks This low budget movie was exactly that. The actors were horrible and said their lines line they were reading them without expression. The plot was lame. I've seen other low budget films that were very good, but this one most certainly did not fall into that category. I'd advise others to steer clear of it and find something worth seeing.	terrible
Horrid Trash, Save your money I have been reading Miss Steel since I was 18, my sister gave me Palamino. Over the last two years, I have found Miss Steel's books to be utter trash, she just keeps repeating herself over and over and over, page after page. It's like reading the same chapter 20 times. Miss Steel, what has happenned to to your ideas, like Jewels, Message from Nam, Zoya, wwhere the stories were actually good and interesting. I think you're the only author that seems to put out 4 to 5 books a year. Maybe slow it down and put out something of quality again. People work to hard to buy garbage like The Cottage and Bungalow. Shame on you, for becoming a lazy author. My advice to readers, find a new author to read, as Miss Steel is obviously out of ideas.	terrible
Yeah, right! First of all, men like this don't exist, which is probably why I thought of it as so sickening.Next, to the review. Wilson and Jane are a middle-aged couple having some marital troubles. He forgets their anniversary, so the next year, he plans some freakishly odd gift where he leaves notes and little presents around the house all leading up to them meeting at her parents old house for a dinner date. Then we have to read through a page and a half of them having sex in what was once Jane's parents' room. Am I crazy, or do we all feel sick when we read something like, "Down to the floor went her new dress and my jacket." (Yup, I thought so.)So, unless you like reading about what goes on in a 40 year old bedroom (yes, everyone does it, and I enjoy reading romances, but Sparks makes all of his sex scenes graphic.)This is all I shall leave you with my friends. Take it or leave it!	terrible
bad battery -worse customer service The battery is weak and lasted less than a year. Trying to get another one from Worx customer service has been an unbelievable and terrible experience.

No Bring back the Lyricist Lounge Show and the original MTV Jams.I remember I was so excited when they had MTV Jams on and they played nothing but strait up banging hip hop from the 1990s.Then there was the Lyricist Lounge. for you people that only watch todays rap videos you missed it. It was just dudes having skits and just doing great rapping. Look at 106 Park and Freestyle Fridays and times that by a hundred and your close to the Lyricist Lounge. some of the members were Kweli-Mos-Words-Em-Big and even of tight people who are no names. and as plain white said bring back shows such as The Tom Green Show are atleast put out some DVDs. As for this junk I believe it is a step or two a head of the excellent show-Pimp my Ride. Tell MTV to start showing some PIMP rap from 1994 like Nas or Snoop are DJ Premier beats. I hate that punk Ashton Kutchar and all I have to say is Bruce will kick yo white Azz.	terrible

Not Recommended I regret buying this book. This book was advertised in Spirituality & Insights, a magazine to which I subscribe. I bought it because I thought it was an insight into true stories about animals & how they'd spiritually communicated. What this book is actually about is a religion/cult that Harold Klemp, a self-prophesed prophet, calls ECK. These are fictional 1 1/2 page stories that could be bedtime stories for children. Not what I had in mind. I've read 2 stories & will read no further.I consider myself very open minded & am of no specific religion. I believe all faiths offer something. I dont like that this book was portrayed as though it would provide a defining insight that animals do indeed have souls. (I dont doubt that they do)If you want a nonfiction book about whether or not animals have souls, do not buy this book. If you're interested in "ECK" then buy this, cuz thats all it is promoting, nothing else.	terrible
THE TRUTH I bought a medium size of Maxi View. The truth is this mirror block part of my view. I can see so much better from my SUV mirrors.

Don't waste your money I've had my Cuisinart coffeepot for 11 years now, and recently broke the original carafe that came with it. Even after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase the replacement. Well let me tell you, believe everything you read here! My new carafe cracked within 5 weeks of using it! I did not drop it or abuse it in any way. I was putting it back in the coffee maker after pouring myself a cup of coffee and viola! it cracked! All I can say is that I will never buy another Cuisinart product again EVER! I believe as others do that the glass is too thin on the replacement model. PIECE OF JUNK!!! Don't waste your money. You would be better off to buy a new coffee maker for $50, than to keep buying new carafes for $20 every two months. I personally will be researching my new coffee maker on Consumer Reports before I head back here to purchase.	terrible

Hands down, this is the worst. I'm a big fan of the show. I seen the bulk of the Doctor Who run (from both series) including many of the recreations of the lost episodes. All shows have good and bad episodes; and you know that there is something special about a show when the bad episodes are entertaining (I have a deep soft spot for Horns of Nimon). But, Delta and the Bannermen is joyless pap. There is nothing redeeming about it. The acting is bad, the story doesn't work, the premise is ridiculous, Mel is at her worst, the bad guys make no sense, the supporting cast are totally shallow and make bizarre decisions, and worst of all it revolves around the 80s obsession with the 50s.I'd rather watch a marathon of Time-Flight, Fear Her, Two Doctors, Timelash, and Twin Dilemma over watching this again. It makes Creature from the Pit look like a masterpiece.So many great episodes were lost, yet this survives. ech.	terrible

I will not buy from this producer again.	terrible
Its ok I just purchased this product two weeks ago. The picture looks great on my old Panasonic Tv. I don't like the fact that it does not play cd-r or cd-wr, but that is my fault for not checking into that before I purchased it. Also the remote control doesn't work that great. I have to be directly in front of the player for it to work. I thought it was the batteries, but when I put new ones in I still had the same problem. Should have purchased a Panasonic or a Sony.

Not so great This journal kinda stunk for me because I thought it would give me more of a guide about what to write. It simply said "write about this or that" and gave a Bible verse.

It's good for people who just want to write about stuff anyway, but not really for people who want a deeper insight to Christ.	bad

Bubba Go Sleep This "redemptive Elvis mummy movie" is a cute idea not very well realized. I think the problem is the script. The action is kind of plodding (well, you are dealing with two old guys with a walker and wheelchair respectively), and the dialog is lame and vulgar. In addition, the soundtrack keeps hitting you over the head with the same musical theme, that sounds like something ripped off from Local Hero, or whatever the movie of some years back that Mark Knopfler scored. Bubba had me looking at my watch after about thirty minutes -- and I wound up returning the video to the rental store without even checking out the deleted scenes. If the scenes included in the movie are this weak, I have no interest in seeing the ones not deemed even that worthy! A great waste of the talent of Ossie Davis. The director Don Toscarelli needs to be advised that writing his own screenplay was NOT the way to save money on this admittedly low-budget production.	bad
not worth the 50 bucks i can save you the time and effort of reading this book. the main theme is to never discount your fees. that's about it. quick to read and kind of helpful but not the best book out there on recruiting.	bad
Surprisingly Dissapointed For someone like me who had grown to love these characters, I found the ending episodes to be a let down. The ending was appropriate, but for all the characters to die and then be reborn somehow was very depressing and confusing. Though it did follow the previous episodes with the beautiful art and music, it was a very bad way to end such a great series. Almost everyone else that I talked to about the show agreed with me on this.	bad
Not up to the usual high standard I have used Rick Steves' books for prior trips to Spain and France, and found them incredibly helpful and informative. This one, however, was slim on information. One example is the scarcity of restaurant recommendations in Amsterdam. This one missed the mark.	bad
Not very simple ! The outline of the book is not very linear. If you are an experienced web programmer maybe you'll use some of the tables of styles but everything else is hard to find and there's not much detail on how to use the method's. If you're a beginner to Styles and Html the only thing you will use is the little html tutorial at the end of the book.I do not recommend this book to a person who wishes to buid stylish web pages in an user centered form because it focuses mainly in programming for Netcape 4+ (not NS6).If you enjoy using the index every 5 minutes buy it otherwise don't !	bad
Don't waste your money Their books seem to focus on making money in real estate. Why don't they come out and say so. How many people do you know that have boought a house with no moeny down? This book is not reality but it sure is making them rich.	bad
okay I cannot believe that Shawn exists anywhere. Please tell me there is absolutely no brother out there that fit that MO. If he exist zap him back to Mars. Cheap and dumb that is so far-fetched. There was some funny scenes (the dinner and trying to duck out on paying a tab). Jocks are not all dumb and even if you find one that is leaning in that direction at least he would recognize Jesse Jackson and know that "keeping hope alive" is not a sick girl. As dumb as Shawn was he was still able to sleep with a knockout. What's that all about? I finished the book because I like to finish what I start. I give it two stars for effort.	bad
My amazon experience I would love to give a review of this book but the disappointing part is I still haven't received it!

Never caught my interest A single Jewish attorney sets out to find the perfect husband before she reaches 35.I couldn't get into the story.

It's not EC... I was hoping to hear EC doing some of great works on the Strat or His Gibson J-45 or maybe even His Signiture Martin But NOPE. It's just a bunch of Studio or Session Musicians doing Cover's of EC's work. If You enjoy just good Music and don't mind that it not the Artist Themself's then this is a nice CD. Buy It, You'll love it, But if Your like Me, I want the Real Artist playing their Music. I'm a big Eric Clapton and back in the 70's when I was a Studio Musician, I got to sit in and Play with Him so to Me if it's not EC, I'm just not in to it.	bad
If you are a PRO, don't buy this book. I can't believe I purchased a book that is simply a compilation of logos that vary from good to terrible. This time David E. Carter had very little to say and the book is only acceptable if you are a beginner in the graphic design industry. If you are a Professional, don't even think of buying it, you're gonna waste your money just like I did.	bad
It could have been better. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love everything about the musical - the live musical, that is. The video is awful! The cast does wonderfully, but the production value is horrible. The editing is choppy, the music is practically canned, and the addition of "special effects" makes me cringe. Some of the scenes are hacked to bits, especially Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer, and then there's Growltiger's Last Stand (the most amazing scene IMO), which was nowhere to be found! This video takes away all the intimacy and subtlety of the stage version. It's a decent video, but it doesn't, in *any* way, come close to reliving the magic that is Cats.	bad

Disappointing to the max!!!! I waited for this book with more anticipation than probably any other book I have ever read. The need for Harris to provide details that got more graphic as the story progressed is nothing but a shock ploy. While I loved his other books this offering has poor character development and worse plot flow. If this is what takes him all these years to produce I for one will not be anxiously awaiting another.	bad
