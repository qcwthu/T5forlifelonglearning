Good evening , everyone .	evening ! time ;
We begin tonight with a couple of urgent questions for the government .	tonight ! time ; a couple ! num ;
There 's a man on trial in New York for bombing the American embassy in Kenya two years ago .	New York ! country ; American ! national ; Kenya two years ago ! country ;
The FBI says when they questioned him , he told them of another plot to bomb an American ship in Yemen , where the `` USS Cole '' was ultimately attacked .	FBI ! org ; American ! national ; Yemen ! country ; the `` USS Cole '' ! product ;
Question one , did the FBI make it clear what the man had told them ?	one ! num ; FBI ! org ;
Question two , did the Pentagon and the CIA get the message and do nothing about it ?	two ! num ; Pentagon ! org ; CIA ! org ;
Here 's your national correspondent , John M Wethy .	John M Wethy ! person ;
In the days after the bombing of the American embassy in Nairobi , Mohammed Al - owhali was arrested by Kenyan authorities and interrogated by the FBI .	American ! national ; Nairobi ! country ; Mohammed Al - owhali ! person ; Kenyan ! national ; FBI ! org ;
He told the FBI he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden .	FBI ! org ; Osama Bin Laden ! person ;
ABC News has learned he also provided details of a plan to attack an American warship in Yemen .	ABC News ! org ; American ! national ; Yemen ! country ;
Al - owhali said it would be a rocket attack , conducted by a Bin Laden terrorist cell , and it would come in the next few months .	Al - owhali ! person ; Bin Laden ! person ;
The next morning , August 1998 , the FBI sent out a classified message , under Director Louis Freeh 's name , warning of a plot to attack a U.S. Navy ship in Yemen .	The next morning ! time ; August 1998 ! date ; FBI ! org ; Louis Freeh ! person ; U.S. Navy ! org ; Yemen ! country ;
The FBI message went to three Pentagon agencies , and as a result , the visit of one American warship to Yemen was canceled .	FBI ! org ; three Pentagon ! num ; American ! org ; Yemen ! national ;
The warning came as General Anthony Zinni was finalizing an agreement for refueling ships in the Yemeni port of Aden .	Anthony Zinni ! person ; Yemeni ! national ; Aden ! country ;
It apparently left no lasting impression .	end
Zinni testifying after the attack on the `` USS Cole '' -- Aden never had a specific terrorist threat .	Zinni ! person ; the `` USS Cole '' ! product ; Aden ! country ;
All the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats .	end
So what happened to the FBI warning ?	FBI ! org ;
CIA officials say they never received it .	CIA ! org ;
FBI officials say they did copy the CIA .	FBI ! org ; CIA ! org ;
Pentagon officials say they got the warning , but had no idea the source was such a well - connected insider within Bin Laden 's organization .	Pentagon ! org ; Bin Laden 's ! person ;
This raises a fundamental question -- if the message had been more clearly communicated and understood , would American lives have been saved ?	American ! national ;

This was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely .	the day ! date ;
Tonight on Israeli television , Prime Minister Barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n't stop , Barak 's spokesman said Israel will continue to use live ammunition .

We do have to try to reduce the violee and take a turn back for a period of calmness so that we can move back to a peace process , but even if the violence subsides , Israelis and Palestinians will still have to deal with an open wound -- a scar so long and so deep from these last two weeks , it may be years before there is a real effort at talking peace again .	Israelis ! national ; Palestinians ! national ; these last two weeks ! date ; years ! date ;
Both sides have almost stepped back six years in terms of their statements and attitudes , six years or more -- before the Oslo accords , when the Israelis promised land and the Palestinians promised security .	six years ! date ; six years or more ! date ; the Oslo accords ! law ; Israelis ! national ; Palestinians ! national ;
Today there is only finger pointing .	Today ! date ;
Arafat deliberately launched it in order to attract the attention of the world by paying with the blood of his own people .	Arafat ! person ;
I urge Mr. Barak to lift the siege of Palestinians , to speak to the Palestinians as its neighbors because they are his neighbors .	Barak ! person ; Palestinians ! national ; Palestinians ! national ;
The Palestinians clearly face the greatest pressure in this summit , since the Israelis are not the only ones blaming them for the outbreak of violence .	Palestinians ! national ; Israelis ! national ;
I think we all know that Arafat is in charge of the Palestinian Authority .	Arafat ! person ; the Palestinian Authority ! org ;

In what may have been a ripple effect of the Middle East crisis , an explosion today killed at least four sailors on a US Navy destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden .	Middle East ! location ; today ! date ; at least four ! num ; US Navy ! org ; Yemeni ! national ; Aden ! country ;
American investigators are going to the scene but in Washington at the White House , the Pentagon and the State Department , US officials are already expressing suspicions that today 's explosion was an act of terrorism .	American ! national ; Washington ! country ; the White House ! fact ; Pentagon ! fact ; the State Department ! fact ; US ! country ; today ! date ;
The World 's Clark Boyd reports .	World ! org ; Clark Boyd ! person ;
The blast , which occurred just after noon local time in Yemen , ripped a 20 x 40 foot gash in the USS Cole , a state - of - the - art destroyer that had stopped in Aden to refuel before joining the carrier George Washington in the Persian Gulf .	just after noon ! time ; Yemen ! country ; 20 ! num ; 40 foot ! measure ; the USS Cole ! product ; Aden ! country ; George Washington ! product ; the Persian Gulf ! location ;
Speaking at the Cole 's home base in Norfolk , Virginia , Admiral John Foley said that the Navy is investigating the incident .	Cole ! product ; Norfolk ! country ; Virginia ! country ; John Foley ! person ; Navy ! org ;
I do n't know whether it was terrorism or not .	end
It was an act of certainly a severe belligerence but we do n't know the source , nor can I comment any further on that .	end
But in Washington , Pentagon officials went further saying that they had every reason to suspect that the blast was caused by terrorists .	Washington ! country ; Pentagon ! org ;
The officials said that reports from the scene , including one from an Army officer working in Aden Harbor , suggested that a small rubber craft that was helping the Cole dock came alongside the destroyer and caused the blast .	one ! num ; Army ! org ; Aden Harbor ! fact ; Cole ! product ;
Many , including retired Admiral Eugene Carroll , are suspicious that the small boat may have been loaded with high - power explosives and that the attack was planned .	Eugene Carroll ! person ;
That craft that approached the Cole is a rubber boat , not a big craft , but they would have had to pack it fully with explosives to do the amount of damage that they did to the Cole and that certainly would have taken time to get that put together .	Cole ! product ; Cole ! product ;
While both the Pentagon and the Justice Department today dispatched teams of experts to Yemen to investigate the explosion , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions .	Pentagon ! org ; the Justice Department today ! org ; Yemen ! date ;
Still , she promised that the United States would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast , a sentiment echoed later in the day by President Clinton .	the United States ! country ; later in the day ! time ; Clinton ! person ;
If , as it now appears , this was an act of terrorism , it was a despicable and cowardly act .	end
We will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable .	end
If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East , they will fail utterly .	the Middle East ! location ;
For some terrorism experts today 's attack , which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the Middle East , has an eerily familiar ring to it .	today ! date ; Palestinians ! national ; Israelis ! national ; the Middle East ! location ;
Bruce Hoffman is the director of the Rand Corporation 's Washington office .	Bruce Hoffman ! person ; the Rand Corporation 's Washington ! org ;
We have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in the Middle East often embroil the United States .	the Middle East ! location ; the United States ! country ;
One only has to recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 , also a month before presidential election , also at a time when Israel was involving suitable ferment at that point in Lebanon now with the Palestinians , where the United States was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack .	US Marine ! national ; Lebanon ! country ; 1983 ! date ; a month ! date ; Israel ! country ; Lebanon ! country ; Palestinians ! national ; the United States ! country ;
And if this attack turns out to be the work of terrorists , Hoffman says it would signal a dangerous new trend .	Hoffman ! person ;
Maritime or marine - borne terrorist attacks are actually quite rare .	end
That being said it could well be the beginning of a new pattern .	end
We have made it far more difficult , appropriately so , for terrorists to attack our ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula .	the Arabian Peninsula ! location ;
So , I think terrorists prevented from attacking their targets using their more conventional means ` truck bombs ' have merely adjusted their tactics slightly and obviously they have been successful with it today .	today ! date ;
On Yemeni TV today the country 's President expressed his heart - felt condolences to those who were killed and injured , but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists , although , admits Mohammed Al - Qadhi , editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in the capital Sana , anti-American sentiment has been running high in Yemen because of events in the Middle East .

James , there 's a reason why the Arabs wanted this pre-summit meeting .	James ! person ; Arabs ! national ;
What is the pressure on them prior to the summit ?	end
Well , I think they want to try and iron out any potential difficulties before the heads of state come into town on Saturday and Sunday .	Saturday ! date ; Sunday ! date ;
So this is a preparatory exercise to reach some sort of agreement beforehand .	end
Of course , the problem is that not all Arab states are speaking again with one voice .	Arab ! national ; one ! num ;
What do they hope to achieve ? and what can you claim from the statements made today ?	today ! date ;
It is difficult to say , Arab 's summit have traditionally been exercises in division .	Arab ! national ;
We have already seen problems from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Tuesday who appeared on Al - Jazeera , the pan-Arab satellite channel , and , rubbish , what he said was a draft statement for the end of the summit on Sunday .	Libyan ! national ; Muammar Gaddafi ! person ; Tuesday ! date ; Al - Jazeera ! org ; pan-Arab ! national ; Sunday ! date ;
And he was very categorical that it was too weak and did not harm Israeli interests sufficiently .	Israeli ! national ;
So we have Gadafi on the one hand .	Gadafi ! person ; one ! num ;
On the other hand we have Egypt which was the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish state , which is of course also a top recipient of US aid .	Egypt ! country ; first Arab ! order ; Jewish ! national ; US ! national ;
The Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is more of a voice of moderation against the other side .	Egyptian ! national ; Hosni Mubarak ! person ;
Tell us about what he has been saying .	end
Well , Mr. Mubarak has been , as you say , a voice of moderation .	Mubarak ! person ;
He has invested an awful amount in the peace with Israel , and really he can not afford to let it fail .	Israel ! country ;
We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister Amre Moussa over the last few weeks , but Amre Moussa today at the Foreign Minister 's meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians , in stark contrast to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al - Shara who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab states that happen .

So Egypt is playing a calming role .	Egypt ! country ;
It will not want to see anything too strong coming out of this summit due to end on Sunday .	Sunday ! date ;
What seemed to be the prevailing voices at this point ?	end
There are certainly calls for war against Israel .	Israel ! country ;
Is there much support for that ?	end
Well , actually President Mubarak was very categorical today in condemning calls for war , which he said were very serious and people should understand the implications of just what it meant .	Mubarak ! person ; today ! date ;
Egypt and Jordan do not want to see any sort of conventional war against Israel .	Egypt ! country ; Jordan ! country ; Israel ! country ;
They have both invested enormous amounts in it , and both regimes would be more vulnerable if the peace process were to fail , because detractors and opponents within each country would have ammunition by which to fire at them .	end
How much is the United States entering into the conversation and how much pressure seems to be coming from the United States ?	the United States ! country ; the United States ! country ;
Well today not too much .	end
I mean Madeleine Albright was in Saudi Arabia yesterday where she met with crown prince Abdullah and the new Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad .	Madeleine Albright ! person ; Saudi Arabia yesterday ! country ; Abdullah ! date ; Syrian ! person ; Bashar Al - Assad ! national ;
Interestingly enough she is quoted as telling General Sanholi back to the US that she did not really get too much of a reception from Bashar Al - Assad in terms of lightening the traditionally antagonistic Syrian align towards Israel .	Sanholi ! person ; US ! country ; Bashar Al - Assad ! person ; Syrian ! national ; Israel ! country ;
Nonetheless , the fact that she did meet with Bashar Al - Assad and it was n't Saudi Arabia which is traditionally being more dovish and has supported US policy , it is significant .	Bashar Al - Assad ! person ; Saudi Arabia ! country ; US ! country ;
So , as of today , I would say certainly on the surface there has been little US action .	today ! date ; US ! country ;
Well , thank you very much for the update .	end

Certainly .	end
He is born in 1940 .	1940 ! date ;
He is a product of the Cultural Revolution .	the Cultural Revolution ! thing ;
In fact he had to burn up an entire suitcase full of hundreds of poems and plays and stories at the start of the Cultural Revolution in fear of going to prison , and then in 1983 after being diagnosed with lung cancer , which had killed his father three years earlier and being convinced that he himself was going to die , he gets a kind of reprieve .	hundreds ! num ; the Cultural Revolution ! thing ; 1983 ! date ; three years earlier ! date ;
He gets a second chest X-ray , discovers that he does n't have lung cancer , recognizes that by virtue of the kinds of things that he is writing , his openness to Western literary ideas , that he is in political trouble again , and so he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey of some 15,000 kilometers , mostly on foot , which he takes through southwestern China .	second ! order ; Western ! national ; some 15,000 kilometers ! measure ; China ! country ;
He had survived , if you will , a death sentence , and now in that new freedom of the life in front of him , he takes to the road in the tradition of old Chinese poets and records what he sees , what he hears , the stories that he is told .	Chinese ! national ;
The book is filled with marvelous descriptions of the gorges through which he walks , the mountains that he climbs , indeed the book is called Soul Mountain , the mountain on which he hopes in some way or another to get in touch with his soul , his individual soul , as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced upon him by the Communist Chinese authorities , the social realism that the cadres would have him write in .	Soul Mountain ! art ; Communist Chinese ! national ;
Not only can this fellow write , he can paint too , ca n't he ?	end
He is best known among his neighbors in Paris as a painter .	Paris ! country ;
He has had more than 30 one - man shows and his paintings are quite delicately done and there he is also very well known as a playwright .	30 one ! num ;
I think he has published about 18 plays now and he writes his plays in French .	about 18 ! num ; French ! language ;
Just one last thing quoting him and I wonder if you could respond to this , Christopher , he said at the very beginning of his wonderful speech to the Nobel Prize Committee , he said , `` I do not wish to waste this talk on literature by saying too much about politics and history , What I want to do is to use this opportunity to speak as one writer in the voice of an individual . ''	one ! num ; Christopher ! person ; the Nobel Prize Committee ! org ;
Is that true basically not only for him that day , today , but of all of his work ?	that day , today ! date ;
Well , the work that we have so far in English translation suggests that , and indeed this novel , which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual , goes so far as to even divide up to the self .	English ! language ;
Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that at a certain point , you have a new he , you have a new she , you have a you , and each one of these characters tells stories , each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in China .

What sort of hold does Russia have on India and Pakistan ?	Russia ! country ; India ! country ; Pakistan ! country ;

Russian President was supposed to visit India as early as 97 - 1998 , but of course Boris Yeltsin 's health problems got in the way of that , and then of course , Mr. Yeltsin 's abrupt resignation last year another visit and then the subsequent election campaign and inauguration of Vladimir Putin took some time , so it 's been put off for a couple of years .

How does this visit by Mr. Putin compare to President Clinton 's visit earlier this year ?	Putin ! person ; Clinton ! person ; earlier this year ! date ;
That 's an interesting question because Vladimir Putin on Wednesday addressed the Indian Parliament just as Bill Clinton had done six months ago , and I think it 's safe to say that Mr. Putin actually probably accomplished more than Mr. Clinton did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing , but it was Mr. Clinton that stole the Indian lawmakers ' hearts .

In fact his visit has somewhat been ignored and in fact the main news story here in India has been sort of a local controversy over the roll - back of fuel prices rather than Mr. Putin 's visit , but he did do what he had to do and he certainly strengthened ties in a strategic sense between Russia and India .

I think a number of the reforms that have come via the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and a number of things that we have done at the SEC are basically making everybody take a new look at how they 're performing their duty as a director , how they 're performing their duties on audit committees and compensation committees and in Wall Street .	the Sarbanes - Oxley Act ! law ; SEC ! org ; Wall Street ! org ;
I think the reforms that came as a part of the large settlement are going to change the way research and investment banking are done to the betterment of the individual investor .	end
And some people are surprised and I might even add pleased in this city that your SEC has been quick to react when Phil Purcell of Morgan Stanley made a statement that your SEC did n't think and that you did n't think expressed appropriate contrition when Bear Stearns stepped out of line in the view of the SEC .

You have also expressed concern about excessive executive compensation , particularly CEO compensation .	end
Is there really anything that can be done about this problem ?	end
I think so , Lou .	Lou ! person ;
I think the real next step here is for compensation committees to spend a little more time than they do on what they 're really compensating for .	end
I think there 's been too much emphasis on performance defined strictly by stock performance and earnings per share .	end
I think there are a number of other measures that indicate how well somebody 's doing running a company , and I think corporation boards need to spend more time on that dimension .	end

I was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside Bagdad airport but I had long thought and I was in Iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , Saddam Hussein made the only self criticism .

He said , I could either invade Kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon .	Kuwait ! country ;
Maybe before the weapon and then later he said , Oh , I should have got the nuclear weapon before I invaded .	end
He was right about that , but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen - years war where the United States could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in `91 when it could have been finished .	dozen - years ! date ; the United States ! country ; `91 ! date ;

I think many people have watched this administration in action and watched Christy Whitman in action .	Christy Whitman ! person ;
The mystery is that she took the job in the first place or did n't leave earlier .	first ! order ;
She was quite a misfit for this administration , and she showed that over and over .	end
She was not good at all at communicating the administration 's message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the EPA bureaucracy , the EPA environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over .

That 's interesting because leading into it , while she was New Jersey governor , she sued the EPA and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the EPA and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .

And like I have n't even started mine . mhm . You know	end
and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular . mhm . It 's true . And that lifting the weights wo n't lose weight .	end
%mm %mm .	end
You wo n't lose it , you know ,	end
but	end
No	end
I mean you might lose some	end
but that 's only when yo- .	end
For a woman who is lifting not that much I do n't think yeah . You would .	end
I mean yeah	end
I mean the only thing is %um just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time .	end
yeah ,	end
So I do n't know	end
maybe she 'll catch on soon .	end
You do burn a lot of calories an hour though , lifting weights .	end
uh-huh .	end
But %uh	end
yeah	end
I mean I do n't think you 're going to lose that much .	end
and also lifting weights at Bally 's means you 're standing on line for as much time as you 're actually lifting .	Bally 's ! fact ;
Really .	end
yeah .	end
That 's too bad .	end
yeah .	end
So is it really overcrowded ?	end
Well , I mean obviously since I work I ca n't get there until about six o'clock at night which is when everyone else gets there .	about six o'clock ! time ;
mhm .	end
mhm .	end
But I 'm sure for people who go in the daytime it 's probably dead . yeah . You know	the daytime ! time ;

He likes Cocoa Pops .	Cocoa Pops ! product ;
oh boy .	end
Wow .	end
That 's pretty crazy .	end

Well I mean he does work his ass off	end
so	end
yeah .	end
But %uh 291.01_291.28_B: %hm .	end

Really ?	end
Like everyone at mom and dad 's table .	end
yeah .	end
Who was at mom and dad 's table ?	end
Weirdo	end
just all of Lorraine 's friends . mhm . Who you know of course most of them mom and dad had at least met once before .	Lorraine ! person ;
mhm .	end
But %uh	end

How hideous they were .	end
Adele was n't at Lisa Manachi 's .	Adele ! person ; Lisa Manachi 's ! person ;
Adele went to the mass wedding .	Adele ! person ;
She did ?	end
uh-huh .	end
oh .	end
And she wanted me to take her	end
and I refused to go	end
and she got mad .	end
Really ?	end
Well I said I would not feel comfortable going .	end
I was not invited . mhm . You know	end
and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding that 's a mass is open to everyone .	end
I was like well that 's fine	end
but I would not feel comfortable going .	end
mhm .	end
I think that would be obnoxious	end
and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me .	end
Right .	end
To -- -- you know the other thing , the reception .	end
I just would n't go .	end
%mm .	end
So they had to take it down and drive her home .	end
%mm .	end
So they 're always kind of pissy at me .	end
%mm . That 's okay .	end
yeah .	end
yeah .	end
I mean I 've been thinking about it	end
and the black 's not going to be so hot you know	end
but	end
mhm .	end
yeah .	end
Apparently they were also carrying lillies which is kind of goofy .	end
yeah .	end
Well I guess she did that because someone suggested that to her because you know the lillies the symbol of the virgin Mary .	Mary ! person ;
mhm .	end
White lillies ?	end
White lillies and black dresses .	end
%mm , my goodness .	end
That 's funny .	end
yeah .	end
yeah .	end
Adele was carrying on that she thought she was at a funeral	Adele ! person ;
and she had to keep reminding herself .	end
%mm .	end
So now you think my wedding 's going to be pretty tasteful right ?	end
But	end
oh yeah .	end
Now what about the matchbooks ?	end
Well I 'll work on it .	end
I still think about the matchbooks .	end
yeah .	end
I 'll tell dad that you still think about the	end
I have n't forgotten those	end
and they 'll still be enough time when I come home for me to order those .	end
yeah .	end
I 'll have remind him of that little -- -- item .	end
yeah .	end
%huh how fun- .	end
You know I was talking to my friend Heather from Wisconsin the other day --	Heather ! person ; Wisconsin ! country ;
-- and she 's telling me about you know her sister 's wedding .	end
And at her sister 's wedding %uh , they provided champagne and beer .	end
But if you wanted any other kind of drink you had to pay for it .	end
mhm .	end
yeah .	end
that 's actually kind of common	end
but -- oh it is . it 's pretty de classe .	end
Well I kind of thou- ,	end
I mean of course I did n't say anything to her .	end
yeah .	end
You know I said as far as I knew we were n't charging people .	end
yeah .	end
Now	end
But %uh ,	end
yeah	end
Dad and I went to buy the wine the other day .	end
And there were having a sale on the wine dad wanted .	end
Are you talking to me ?	end
Of course I 'm talking to you .	end
I can hardly hear you .	end
oh .	end
I thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something .	end
I 'm talking to you .	end
oh .	end
yeah .	end
No dad told me that .	end
oh he did tell you .	end
It 's all Chilean .	Chilean ! national ;
yeah .	end
yeah .	end
Walnut Crest or Walnut Creek or -- %mm . -- something like that .	Walnut Crest ! org ; Walnut Creek ! org ;
I do n't know .	end
%mm .	end
There 's a pretty good sale . %mm . So now we have to keep our eyes open for a champagne sale .	end
An- ,	end
do you know if Jack called Spencer yet ?	Jack ! person ; Spencer ! person ;
I told him this morning to do it this week .	this morning ! time ;
uh-huh .	end
And he just keeps forgetting .	end
yeah .	end
But o-	end
How 's he doing ?	end
Much better .	end
yeah ?	end
yeah .	end
he 's often chipper .	end
He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen .	this morning at five seventeen ! time ;
Pe-	end
oh my god .	end
Is that because he 's not sleeping and	end
Well because he could n't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom .	end
oh .	end
So I think it 's time to give all the cats a bath .	end
%mm .	end
yeah	end
and the- ,	end
you should do that .	end
I know .	end
It 's a two person job though .	two ! num ;
I 'll have to get somebody to help me .	end
%mm . yeah .	end
%hm .	end
But %uh , yeah ,	end
it 's still a fairly expensive call	end
%uh but it 's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it ,	end
then it	end
the Dutch have such high taxes on those	Dutch ! national ;
they consider it a luxury to call around the world	end
so they tax it really high .	end
Anyway %um	end
So you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth	the eighteenth ! date ; the nineteenth ! date ;
and you 're going to go to %uh Amsterdam .	Amsterdam ! country ;
Well I would say is once you 're at a hotel uh-huh %um , why do n't you call me at work and let me know where you are ,	end
and then we can make arrangements that day %um , that I can meet you in Amsterdam .	Amsterdam ! country ;
And maybe I 'll come by , public transport .	end
It 's probably easier for me to come by public transport in Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest .	Amsterdam ! country ;
mhm .	end
The streets are small	end
and there 's no parking .	end
So I probably will come by public transport	end
but I do n't know .	end
We 'll see where you 're staying	end
%um	end
and there 's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff	end
you can see stuff in Amsterdam	Amsterdam ! country ;
and %uh since the days are really long ,	end
I mean it stays light here till about ten thirty eleven o'clock mhm . at night .	ten thirty eleven o'clock ! time ; at night ! time ;
So if you want we can take a ride and go see stuff at night	at night ! time ;
and I can take you to some places ,	end
we can %uh go see some stuff .	end
%um , depends on what you guys want to see .	end
So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know .	end
okay	end
%um and I 'll sit and talk with Anya about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see .	Anya ! person ;
So if you do n't have any ideas we 'll just put something together for you .	end
okay .	end
%um but yeah	end
but I can pick you up th- ,	end
you know I 'll probably be there some time around six	around six ! time ;
and we can like do a quick dinner or something yeah and go see whatever you want to see ,	end
if you want to stay in Amsterdam that 's fine .	Amsterdam ! country ;
If you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of , echte Holland , real Holland and we can do that too .	Holland ! country ; Holland ! country ;
Actually I 've been up to Holland before .	Holland ! country ;
Spent about two weeks up there .	about two weeks ! date ;
yeah .	end
So %um ,	end
but that was years and years ago .	years and years ago ! date ;
With your parents when your father was stationed over here , right ?	end
yeah .	end
But we got to see Den Haag and places like that too which we 're obviously not going to see this time .	Den Haag ! country ;
But %um	end
has Kim been here before ?	Kim ! person ;
And , an-	end
No .	end
oh good .	end
But then again I 'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things .	Kim ! person ; Shape Headquarters ! fact ;
Would you be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters again .	Shape Headquarters ! fact ;
No . Not really .	end
yeah .	end
I did n't think so .	end
Somehow I had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you .	end
yep .	end
I 'm ,	end
the mil- ,	end
I ca n't say too bad things about the military though .	end
They still have my goods	end
and they 'll probably hold them hostage .	end
And they own my body and soul for like another four years	another four years ! date ;
so I just got to pray that they	end
oh do they ?	end
yeah .	end
I owe four years in active reserve time .	four years ! date ;
aw great .	end
Do they do that to everyone ?	end
Milo , get out of there	end
yeah -- -- %eh everyone %uh who has n't been like you were	end
you went through like the thirty six two process .	thirty six two ! num ;
mhm .	end
So you do n't have it	end
but yeah if you just separate normally and you have n't served at least eight years , then you owe it .	at least eight years ! date ;
And that 's one of those things they just never tell you up front .	end
No .	end
They never said anything	end
I figured there was something like that because	end
And I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too .	end
So .	end
yeah .	end
I mean that 's the military .	end
I have my discharge papers and everything	end
uh-huh .	end
and I 've said that yeah I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they call me back for those , but they 're going to have to pay my trip back to the states . because there 's no bases in Holland and I 'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them .	the states ! country ; Holland ! country ; Germany ! country ;
If they want me they can pay ,	end
bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they 're going to drag me off somewhere .	end
But %uh , first they have to find me .	first ! order ;
yeah , that 's the other	end
it was i- ,	end
if you 're in another country I mean and you 're not planning on coming back to the U S what are they going to do even if you do n't .	the U S ! country ;
yeah .	end
Well I mean I 'm still American citizen	American ! national ;
and I still would like to be welcome in my own country .	end
Although g-	end
%uh I mean if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably would n't be a horror either ,	end
but %uh yeah	end
right now I mean I do want to keep my American citizenship	American ! national ;
so .	end
I kind of want to	end
Are you going to become a dual citizen ?	end
What 's that ?	end
Are you going to try and become a dual citizen ?	end
Have dual citizenship ?	end
You ca n't do that ,	end
%um , the only way to be a dual citizen is if you 're born in a foreign country	end
like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .	Holland ! country ; American ! national ;
But you ca n't	end
If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my American citizenship .	Holland ! country ; American ! national ;
As far as the Americans are concerned , yeah .	Americans ! national ;
yeah .	end
The Dutch could care less .	Dutch ! national ;
The Dutch would say fine	Dutch ! national ;
want to be a dual citizen ,	end
that 's fine ,	end
but the Americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship .	Americans ! national ; American ! national ;
I mean it 's kind of stupid .	end
yeah .	end
So I 'm an expatriot .	end
An American expatriot .	American ! national ;
An American living abroad .	American ! national ;
I still have to file a tax return .	end
Do you ?	end
yeah .	end
But my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free .	first seventy five thousand dollars ! order ;
Good grief .	end
As long as I do n't bring it back to the states .	end
Good grief .	end
I R S for you , %huh ?	I R S ! org ;
yeah .	end
oh they want their share .	end
They want their piece of meat .	end
But all foreign taxes are deductible ,	end
and my taxes here are fifty percent of income .	fifty percent ! per ;
So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it .	end
Unless you became C E O of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable , right ?	a thousand dollars ! money ;
yeah .	end
Somehow it raises a small amount .	end
the problem 's going to %uh be Anya 's American salary is taxable here and at fifty percent	Anya ! person ; American ! national ; fifty percent ! per ;
so we 're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary .	the Dutch government ! org ;
aw .	end
Some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount	end
and the amount we pay the American government is deductible ,	the American government ! org ;
but we 'll still owe some taxes .	end
Th- ,	end
see I do n't know how it works .	end
we 're going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue how that all works .	end
They do n't have the Quicken Dutch version ?	Quicken Dutch ! product ;
yeah .	end
%ah , you know I would n't trust it because it 's so complicated with this international garbage or else the Turbo Tax with the Dutch modules . that I just would n't trust it .	the Turbo Tax ! product ; Dutch ! language ;
I do n't know , %eh .	end
yeah .	end
So complicated when you 're dealing with a Dutch tax form .	Dutch ! language ;
Anya had to read it	Anya ! person ;
and Anya and her father did n't understand the damn thing .	Anya ! person ;
How am I supposed to understand it ?	end
I 'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with ,	Oregon ! country ;
Oregon you pay state tax	Oregon ! country ;
Washington you do n't .	Washington ! country ;
I 'm looking forward to that cause %uh	end
yeah	end
but You 'll be a student	end
so you ,	end
I mean you 're	end
what is your income ?	end
oh , well	end
See I think y- , %um ,	end
it 'll probably be about five thousand dollars the portion of this year that I 'm in Oregon	about five thousand dollars the portion of this year ! money ; Oregon ! date ;
and then next year it 'll be eleven thousand .	next year ! date ; eleven thousand ! num ;
yeah .	end
But I mean you 're below the poverty line at that level .	end
yeah .	end
So I mean any income that y-	end
Well	end
But then I 've already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in Washington	like fifteen thousand ! num ; Washington ! country ;
but	end
That should be non taxable out of state income .	end
It should	end
but you know it 's not going to be a fun tax return year .	year ! date ;
I had that when I went into the military .	end
But then again .	end
I had Kans- ,	end
I had to file three taxes .	three ! num ;
I had to file Georgia , Kansas yeah and then my federal .	Georgia ! country ; Kansas ! country ;
So .	end
Well , %um actually I think this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only half an hour ,	half an hour ! time ;
but %um	end
So let 's see .	end
I 'll give you a call when we arrive in h- ,	end
or maybe I 'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we 're there ,	Holland ! country ;
so if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then call you back %um when we get to a hotel or something like that .	the eighteenth ! date ; the nineteenth ! date ;
okay that 's a great idea .	end
as soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled you can call me	Holland ! country ;
and %uh if it 's at night , just call Anya 's parents	night ! time ; Anya ! person ;
okay so	end
and remember that if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero	Holland ! country ; zero ! num ;
so like right now okay it 's one eight one zero area code .	one eight one zero ! num ;
If you dial in Holland , it 's zero one eight one zero . okay in Holland	Holland ! country ; zero one eight one zero ! num ; Holland ! num ;
and then yeah you can just call up	end
if it 's during the work hours , fine , call me at work .	the work hours ! time ;
If not , call Anya 's parents if you do n't have a new phone number for me .	Anya ! person ;
And if you do , I 'll send it by email okay if I get it before this weekend	before this weekend ! date ;
we 'll email you something	end
but if you do n't get email then just call Anya 's parents	Anya ! person ;
If we have a phone by then , they 'll be able to give you the number	end
okay	end
and just remember to ask for her mother .	end
and it 's Goode , right	Goode ! person ;
Bode	Bode ! person ;
Bode	Bode ! person ;
Bode as in abode	Bode ! person ;
abode	end
minus the A	end
okay	end
great	end
and	end
yeah	end
and I think %uh %uh it 's not Frau	end
%uh %ah %uh It 's Mifrau	end
is	end
it 's Frau in German	German ! language ;
it 's Frau	end
mhm	end
and then Dutch it 's Mifrau	Dutch ! language ;
I 'll probably never remember that	end
so hope they wo n't be offended .	end
nah do n't worry about it .	end
You can just call her Missus	end
you can just call her Missus and speak English to her .	English ! language ;
she understands	end
just talk slowly and clearly .	end
okay	end
and once you 're in Holland the line will be really clear .	Holland ! country ;
I mean the phones here are pretty good . once you 're in the country .	end
It 's just these to America	America ! country ;
it 's always kind of iffy	end
So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?	end
Things are going very well .	end
I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss .	Guss ! person ;
oh .	end
And that %um	end
No , you had n't mentioned that .	end
%eh , oh , okay .	end
okay , so %um	end
%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,	end
and you were entertaining offers .	end
And , %uh	end
well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts .	end
%um oh . So things are going extremely well .	end
So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount .	end
You know , he , %uh ,	end
there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then	the next two three years ! date ;
so I decided that it would make sense to do this .	end
%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then .	end
%mm .	end
So I 'm quite pleased .	end
Well that 's good .	end
%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year .	this year ! date ;
I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .	end
But , %uh , it should come out this year .	this year ! date ;
oh , well that 's good .	end
It should be done in a few months .	a few months ! date ;
oh , yeah	end
I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .	end
yeah ,	end
yeah .	end
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?	end
%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .	end
%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .	end
But %ah well . I am working on that one .	end
%uh .	end
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .	end
oh , harsh . Harsh .	end
yeah .	end
yeah ,	end
and .	end
Not a whole lot I can do about that now .	end
Indeed . Indeed .	end
have to deal with the situation .	end
And	end
So that 's what I 'm doing .	end
Sounds good .	end
But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work .	One ! num ;
I 've actually been doing a lot of it .	end
oh wow .	end
And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,	May ! date ;
and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it .	end
yeah ,	end
actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .	one ! num ; one ! num ;
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .	France ! country ; a year and a half ! date ;
yeah .	end
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .	end
yeah .	end
yup ,	end
yup .	end
But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .	one ! num ;
mhm .	end
And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,	one ! num ;
but none of the other models %uh , had ?	end
Yes .	end
the- ,	end
I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .	end
And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .	one ! num ;
Yes .	end
okay .	end
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .	more than one ! num ;
okay .	end
So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .	end
And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,	end
but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .	end
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .	end
okay .	end
Yes .	end
So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .	end
And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .	end
%hm .	end
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .	end
Got it ,	end
got it .	end
I see .	end
So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .	end
But yeah . it gives a driving term .	end
oh , okay .	end
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .	end
Exactly .	end
oh wow .	end
so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .	end
But	end
which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .	end
%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But	end
so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?	Nature ! org ;
%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,	end
I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .	Optics Letters ! org ; Phys Rev Letters ! org ;
%hm .	end
But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .	a couple ! num ;
yeah .	end
%hm . impressive .	end
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,	end
but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .	end
oh , okay .	end
oh , I did n't realize that .	end
okay .	end
yeah ,	end
so that 's why it 's actually a big deal is	end
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics	end
and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .	end
And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .	Neil ! person ;
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,	Neil ! person ;
and it 's true	end
they do in the transients	end
And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .	end
And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,	Neil ! person ; Rochester ! country ;
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .	end
oh cool .	end
and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr	Neil ! person ; second ! time ; a week later ! date ; Bryn Mawr ! org ;
and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .	Lowell ! person ;
Exactly .	end
And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .	Neil ! person ;
Indeed .	end
So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um	end
Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .	end
so you might as well spend the time .	end
Yes , well ,	end
%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,	end
and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .	end
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .	end
Yes .	end
yeah , okay .	end
yeah .	end
I mean the thing that i-	end
this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to .	end
oh .	end
It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that was easy ,	end
it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .	end
Exactly .	end
Exactly .	end
yeah .	end
And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .	end
yeah .	end
And unfortunately .	end
Well , it 's kind of odd .	end
They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .	end
%hm .	end
as far	end
yeah	end
as a .	end
The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,	first ! order ;
mostly worthless stuff .	end
And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,	end
it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless .	end
%huh .	end
So .	end
That 's bizarre . Bizarre .	end
so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ?	second ! order ;
Actually , no ,	end
all they stole the second time was my bike .	second ! order ;
%huh .	end
Which was actually where the major problem came . Exactly . Exactly . yeah . Is that I suddenly had no transportation .	end
And so , I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike ,	end
and %mm . that cost me a lot of time .	end
yeah .	end
Exactly .	end
Because ,	end
yes	end
Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes , and nah well . then getting one purchased , and then having to , you know , go get it and things like that .	one ! num ;
But , that 's dealt with at least .	end
And so %uh , that 's yeah at least dealt with .	end
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this .	end
But yeah . yeah .	end
At least Well that would make sense during the summer %uh according to the stipulations of my fellowship , I can actually earn money during the summer .	the summer ! date ;
Jesus called his twelve apostles together .	end
He gave them power to heal sicknesses and power to force demons out of people .	end
He sent them to tell about God 's kingdom and to heal the sick .	end
He said to them , `` When you travel , do n't take a walking stick .	end
Also , do n't carry a bag , food , or money .	end
Take for your trip only the clothes you are wearing .	end
When you go into a house , stay there until it is time to leave .	end
If the people in the town will not welcome you , go outside the town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . ''	end
So the apostles went out .	end
They traveled through all the towns .	end
They told the Good News and healed people everywhere .	end
Herod the ruler heard about all these things that were happening .	end
He was confused because some people said , `` John the Baptizer has risen from death . ''	end
Others said , `` Elijah has come to us . ''	end
And some others said , `` One of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . ''	end
Herod said , `` I cut off John 's head .	end
So who is this man I hear these things about ? ''	end
Herod continued trying to see Jesus .	end
When the apostles came back , they told Jesus what they had done on their trip .	end
Then he took them away to a town called Bethsaida .	end
There , he and his apostles could be alone together .	end
But the people learned where Jesus went and followed him .	end
He welcomed them and talked with them about God 's kingdom .	end
He healed the people who were sick .	end
Late in the afternoon , the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said , `` No one lives in this place .	end
Send the people away .	end
They need to find food and places to sleep in the farms and towns around here . ''	end
But Jesus said to the apostles , `` You give them something to eat . ''	end
They said , `` We have only five loaves of bread and two fish .	end
Do you want us to go buy food for all these people ? ''	end
There are too many !	end
-LRB- There were about 5000 men there . -RRB-	end
Jesus said to his followers , `` Tell the people to sit in groups of about 50 people . ''	end
So the followers did this and everyone sat down .	end
Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish .	end
He looked up into the sky and thanked God for the food .	end
Then he broke it into pieces , which he gave to the followers to give to the people .	end
They all ate until they were full .	end
And there was a lot of food left .	end
Twelve baskets were filled with the pieces of food that were not eaten .	end
One time Jesus was praying alone .	end
His followers came together there , and he asked them , `` Who do the people say I am ? ''	end
They answered , `` Some people say you are John the Baptizer .	end
Others say you are Elijah .	end
And some people say you are one of the prophets from long ago that has come back to life . ''	end
Then Jesus said to his followers , `` And who do you say I am ? ''	end
Peter answered , `` You are the Christ from God . ''	end
Jesus warned them not to tell anyone .	end
Then Jesus said , `` The Son of Man must suffer many things .	end
He will be rejected by the older Jewish leaders , the leading priests , and teachers of the law .	end
And he will be killed .	end
But after three days he will be raised from death . ''	end
Jesus continued to say to all of them , `` Any of you who want to be my follower must stop thinking about yourself and what you want .	end
You must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you every day for following me .	end
Any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it .	end
But you who give up your life for me will save it .	end
It is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost .	end
Do n't be ashamed of me and my teaching .	end
If that happens , I will be ashamed of you when I come with my divine greatness and that of the Father and the holy angels .	end
Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom before you die . ''	end
About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James and went up on a mountain to pray .	end
While Jesus was praying , his face began to change .	end
His clothes became shining white .	end
Then two men were there , talking with him .	end
They were Moses and Elijah .	end
They also looked bright and glorious .	end
They were talking with Jesus about his death that would happen in Jerusalem .	end
Peter and the others were asleep .	end
But they woke up and saw the glory of Jesus .	end
They also saw the two men who were standing with him .	end
When Moses and Elijah were leaving , Peter said , ``	end
Master , it is good that we are here .	end
We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''	end
-LRB- He did not know what he was saying . -RRB-	end
While Peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them .	end
Peter , John , and James were afraid when the cloud covered them .	end
A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son .	end
He is the one I have chosen .	end
Obey him . ''	end
When the voice stopped , only Jesus was there .	end
Peter , John , and James said nothing .	end
And for a long time after that , they told no one about what they had seen .	end
The next day , Jesus , Peter , John , and James came down from the mountain .	end
A large group of people met Jesus .	end
A man in the group shouted to him , `` Teacher , please come and look at my son .	end
He is the only child I have .	end
An evil spirit comes into him , and then he shouts .	end
He loses control of himself and foams at the mouth .	end
The evil spirit continues to hurt him and almost never leaves him .	end
I begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son , but they could not do it . ''	end
Jesus answered , `` You people today have no faith .	end
Your lives are all wrong .	end
How long must I be with you and be patient with you ? ''	end
Then Jesus said to the man , `` Bring your son here . ''	end
While the boy was coming , the demon threw the boy to the ground .	end
The boy lost control of himself .	end
But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit .	end
Then the boy was healed , and Jesus gave him back to his father .	end
All the people were amazed at the great power of God .	end
The people were still amazed about all the things Jesus did .	end
He said to his followers , `` Do n't forget what I will tell you now : The Son of Man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . ''	end
But the followers did not understand what he meant .	end
The meaning was hidden from them so that they could not understand it .	end
But they were afraid to ask Jesus about what he said .	end
Jesus ' followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .	end
Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him .	end
Then he said to the followers , `` Whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me .	end
And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me .	end
The one among you who is the most humble -- this is the one who is great . ''	end
John answered , `` Master , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people .	end
We told him to stop because he does not belong to our group . ''	end
Jesus said to him , `` Do n't stop him .	end
Whoever is not against you is for you . ''	end
The time was coming near when Jesus would leave and go back to heaven .	end
He decided to go to Jerusalem .	end
He sent some men ahead of him .	end
They went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him .	end
But the people there would not welcome Jesus because he was going toward Jerusalem .	end
James and John , the followers of Jesus , saw this .	end
They said , `` Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people ? ''	end
But Jesus turned and criticized them for saying this .	end
Then he and his followers went to another town .	end
They were all traveling along the road .	end
Someone said to Jesus , `` I will follow you anywhere you go . ''	end
He answered , `` The foxes have holes to live in .	end
The birds have nests .	end
But the Son of Man has no place where he can rest his head . ''	end
Jesus said to another man , `` Follow me ! ''	end
But the man said , `` Lord , let me go and bury my father first . ''	end
But Jesus said to him , `` Let the people who are dead bury their own dead .	end
You must go and tell about God 's kingdom . ''	end
Another man said , `` I will follow you , Lord , but first let me go and say goodbye to my family . ''	end
Jesus said , `` Anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for God 's kingdom . ''	end
Jesus was going through the city of Jericho .	end
In Jericho there was a man named Zacchaeus .	end
He was a wealthy , very important tax collector .	end
He wanted to see who Jesus was .	end
There were many others who wanted to see Jesus too .	end
Zacchaeus was too short to see above the people .	end
So he ran to a place where he knew Jesus would come .	end
Then he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .	end
When Jesus came to where Zacchaeus was , he looked up and saw him in the tree .	end
Jesus said , `` Zacchaeus , hurry !	end
Come down !	end
I must stay at your house today . ''	end
Zacchaeus hurried and came down .	end
He was happy to have Jesus in his house .	end
Everyone saw this .	end
They began to complain , `` Look at the kind of man Jesus is staying with .	end
Zacchaeus is a sinner ! ''	end
Zacchaeus said to the Lord , `` I want to do good .	end
I will give half of my money to the poor .	end
If I have cheated anyone , I will pay them back four times more . ''	end
Jesus said , `` Today is the day for this family to be saved from sin .	end
Yes , even this tax collector is one of God 's chosen people .	end
The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them . ''	end
As the crowd listened to what he was saying , Jesus went on to tell a story .	end
He was now near Jerusalem and knew that the people thought it was almost time for God 's kingdom to come .	end
So he said , `` A very important man was preparing to go to a country far away to be made a king .	end
Then he planned to return home and rule his people .	end
So he called ten of his servants together .	end
He gave a bag of money to each servant .	end
He said , ' Do business with this money until I come back . '	end
But the people in the kingdom hated the man .	end
They sent a group to follow him to the other country .	end
There they said , ' We do n't want this man to be our king . '	end
`` But the man was made king .	end
When he came home , he said , ' Call those servants who have my money .	end
I want to know how much more money they earned with it . '	end
The first servant came and said , ' Sir , I earned ten bags of money with the one bag you gave me . '	end
The king said to him , ' That 's great !	end
You are a good servant .	end
I see that I can trust you with small things .	end
So now I will let you rule over ten of my cities . '	end
`` The second servant said , ' Sir , with your one bag of money I earned five bags . '	end
The king said to this servant , ' You can rule over five cities . '	end
`` Then another servant came in and said to the king , ' Sir , here is your bag of money .	end
I wrapped it in a piece of cloth and hid it .	end
I was afraid of you because you are a hard man .	end
You even take money that you did n't earn and gather food that you did n't grow . '	end
`` Then the king said to him , ' What a bad servant you are !	end
I will use your own words to condemn you .	end
You said that I am a hard man .	end
You said that I even take money that I did n't earn and gather food that I did n't grow .	end
If that is true , you should have put my money in the bank .	end
Then , when I came back , my money would have earned some interest . '	end
Then the king said to the men who were watching , ' Take the bag of money away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten bags of money . '	end
`` The men said to the king , ' But sir , that servant already has ten bags of money . '	end
`` The king said , ' People who use what they have will get more .	end
But those who do not use what they have will have everything taken away from them .	end
Now where are my enemies ?	end
Where are the people who did not want me to be king ?	end
Bring my enemies here and kill them .	end
I will watch them die . ' ''	end
After Jesus said these things , he continued traveling toward Jerusalem .	end
He came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives .	end
He sent out two of his followers .	end
He said , `` Go into the town you can see there .	end
When you enter the town , you will find a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden .	end
Untie it , and bring it here to me .	end
If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , you should say , ' The Master needs it . ' ''	end
The two followers went into town .	end
They found the donkey exactly like Jesus told them .	end
They untied it , but its owners came out .	end
They said to the followers , `` Why are you untying our donkey ? ''	end
The followers answered , `` The Master needs it . ''	end
So the followers brought the donkey to Jesus .	end
They put their coats on its back .	end
Then they put Jesus on the donkey .	end
He rode along the road toward Jerusalem .	end
The followers spread their coats on the road before him .	end
Jesus was coming close to Jerusalem .	end
He was already near the bottom of the Mount of Olives .	end
The whole group of followers was happy .	end
They were very excited and praised God .	end
They thanked God for all the powerful things they had seen .	end
They said , `` ' Welcome !	end
God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord . '	end
Peace in heaven and glory to God ! ''	end
Some of the Pharisees said to Jesus , `` Teacher , tell your followers not to say these things . ''	end
But Jesus answered , `` I tell you , if my followers did n't say them , these stones would shout them . ''	end
Jesus came near Jerusalem .	end
Looking at the city , he began to cry for it and said , `` I wish you knew today what would bring you peace .	end
But it is hidden from you now .	end
A time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides .	end
They will destroy you and all your people .	end
Not one stone of your buildings will stay on top of another .	end
All this will happen because you did not know the time when God came to save you . ''	end
Jesus went into the Temple area .	end
He began to throw out the people who were selling things there .	end
He said , `` The Scriptures say , ' My Temple will be a house of prayer . '	end
But you have changed it into a ' hiding place for thieves . ' ''	end
Jesus taught the people in the Temple area every day .	end
The leading priests , the teachers of the law , and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill him .	end
But they did not know how they could do it , because everyone was listening to him .	end
The people were very interested in what Jesus said .	end
I really do n't need to write to you about this help for God 's people .	end
I know that you want to help .	end
I have been bragging about you to the people in Macedonia .	end
I told them that you people in Achaia have been ready to give since last year .	end
And your desire to give has made most of the people here ready to give also .	end
But I am sending the brothers to you .	end
I do n't want our bragging about you in this to be for nothing .	end
I want you to be ready just as I said you would be .	end
If any of those from Macedonia come with me , and they find that you are not ready , we will be ashamed .	end
We will be ashamed that we were so sure of you .	end
And you will be ashamed too !	end
So I thought that I should ask these brothers to come there before we do .	end
They will help in getting together the generous gift you promised .	end
Then it will be ready when we come , and it will be seen as a blessing you are giving , not as something you were forced to do .	end
Remember this : The one who plants few seeds will have a small harvest .	end
But the one who plants a lot will have a big harvest .	end
Each one of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give .	end
You should not give if it makes you unhappy or if you feel forced to give .	end
God loves those who are happy to give .	end
And God can give you more blessings than you need , and you will always have plenty of everything .	end
You will have enough to give to every good work .	end
As the Scriptures say , `` He gives generously to the poor ; his goodness will continue forever . ''	end
God is the one who gives seed to those who plant , and he gives bread for food .	end
And God will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow .	end
He will produce a great harvest from your goodness .	end
God will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely .	end
And your giving through us will make people give thanks to God .	end
The service you are offering helps God 's people with their needs , but that is not all it does .	end
It is also bringing more and more thanks to God .	end
This service is a proof of your faith , and people will praise God because of it .	end
They will praise him because you are following the message about Christ -- the message you say you believe .	end
They will praise God because you freely share with them and with all people .	end
And when they pray , they will wish they could be with you .	end
They will feel this way because of the great grace that God gave you .	end
Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful to describe .	end
While Apollos was in the city of Corinth , Paul was visiting some places on his way to Ephesus .	end
In Ephesus he found some other followers of the Lord .	end
He asked them , `` Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ''	end
These followers said to him , `` We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit ! ''	end
Paul asked them , `` So what kind of baptism did you have ? ''	end
They said , `` It was the baptism that John taught . ''	end
Paul said , `` John told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives .	end
He told people to believe in the one who would come after him , and that one is Jesus . ''	end
When these followers heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .	end
Then Paul laid his hands on them , and the Holy Spirit came on them .	end
They began speaking different languages and prophesying .	end
There were about twelve men in this group .	end
Paul went into the synagogue and spoke very boldly .	end
He continued doing this for three months .	end
He talked with the Jews , trying to persuade them to accept what he was telling them about God 's kingdom .	end
But some of them became stubborn and refused to believe .	end
In front of everyone , they said bad things about the Way .	end
So Paul left these Jews and took the Lord 's followers with him .	end
He went to a place where a man named Tyrannus had a school .	end
There Paul talked with people every day .	end
He did this for two years .	end
Because of this work , everyone in Asia , Jews and Greeks , heard the word of the Lord .	end
God used Paul to do some very special miracles .	end
Some people carried away handkerchiefs and clothes that Paul had used and put them on those who were sick .	end
The sick people were healed , and evil spirits left them .	end
Some Jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people .	end
The seven sons of Sceva , one of the leading priests , were doing this .	end
These Jews tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to make the evil spirits go out of people .	end
They all said , `` By the same Jesus that Paul talks about , I order you to come out ! ''	end
But one time an evil spirit said to these Jews , `` I know Jesus , and I know about Paul , but who are you ? ''	end
Then the man who had the evil spirit inside him jumped on these Jews .	end
He was much stronger than all of them .	end
He beat them up and tore their clothes off .	end
They all ran away from that house .	end
All the people in Ephesus , Jews and Greeks , learned about this .	end
They were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the Lord Jesus .	end
Many of the believers began to confess , telling about all the evil things they had done .	end
Some of them had used magic .	end
These believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone .	end
These books were worth about 50 , 000 silver coins .	end
This is how the word of the Lord was spreading in a powerful way , causing more and more people to believe .	end
After this , Paul made plans to go to Jerusalem .	end
He planned to go through the regions of Macedonia and Achaia , and then go to Jerusalem .	end
He thought , `` After I visit Jerusalem , I must also visit Rome . ''	end
Timothy and Erastus were two of his helpers .	end
Paul sent them ahead to Macedonia .	end
But he stayed in Asia for a while .	end
But during that time there was some trouble in Ephesus about the Way .	end
This is how it all happened : There was a man named Demetrius .	end
He worked with silver .	end
He made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess Artemis .	end
The men who did this work made a lot of money .	end
Demetrius had a meeting with these men and some others who did the same kind of work .	end
He told them , `` Men , you know that we make a lot of money from our business .	end
But look at what this man Paul is doing .	end
Listen to what he is saying .	end
He has convinced many people in Ephesus and all over Asia to change their religion .	end
He says the gods that people make by hand are not real .	end
I 'm afraid this is going to turn people against our business .	end
But there is also another problem .	end
People will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is not important .	end
Her greatness will be destroyed .	end
And Artemis is the goddess that everyone in Asia and the whole world worships . ''	end
When the men heard this , they became very angry .	end
They shouted , `` Great is Artemis , the goddess of Ephesus ! ''	end
The whole city was thrown into confusion .	end
The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , men from Macedonia who were traveling with Paul , and rushed all together into the stadium .	end
Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the Lord 's followers did not let him go .	end
Also , some leaders of the country who were friends of Paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium .	end
Some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else .	end
The meeting was very confused .	end
Most of the people did not know why they had come there .	end
Some Jews made a man named Alexander stand before the crowd , and they told him what to say .	end
Alexander waved his hand , trying to explain things to the people .	end
But when the people saw that Alexander was a Jew , they all began shouting the same thing .	end
For two hours they continued shouting , `` Great is Artemis of Ephesus !	end
Great is Artemis of Ephesus !	end
Great is Artemis . . . ! ''	end
Then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet .	end
He said , `` Men of Ephesus , everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis .	end
Everyone knows that we also keep her holy rock .	end
No one can deny this , so you should be quiet .	end
You must stop and think before you do anything else .	end
`` You brought these men here , but they have not said anything bad against our goddess .	end
They have not stolen anything from her temple .	end
We have courts of law and there are judges .	end
Do Demetrius and those men who work with him have a charge against anyone ?	end
They should go to the courts .	end
Let them argue with each other there .	end
`` Is there something else you want to talk about ?	end
Then come to the regular town meeting of the people .	end
It can be decided there .	end
I say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting .	end
We could not explain all this trouble , because there is no real reason for this meeting . ''	end
After the city clerk said this , he told the people to go home .	end
In Jerusalem Saul was still trying to scare the followers of the Lord , even saying he would kill them .	end
He went to the high priest and asked him to write letters to the synagogues in the city of Damascus .	end
Saul wanted the high priest to give him the authority to find people in Damascus who were followers of the Way .	end
If he found any believers there , men or women , he would arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem .	end
So Saul went to Damascus .	end
When he came near the city , a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around him .	end
He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , `` Saul , Saul !	end
Why are you persecuting me ? ''	end
Saul said , `` Who are you , Lord ? ''	end
The voice answered , `` I am Jesus , the one you are persecuting .	end
Get up now and go into the city .	end
Someone there will tell you what you must do . ''	end
The men traveling with Saul just stood there , unable to speak .	end
They heard the voice , but they saw no one .	end
Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes , but he could not see .	end
So the men with him held his hand and led him into Damascus .	end
For three days Saul could not see ; he did not eat or drink .	end
There was a follower of Jesus in Damascus named Ananias .	end
In a vision the Lord said to him , `` Ananias ! ''	end
Ananias answered , `` Here I am , Lord . ''	end
The Lord said to him , `` Get up and go to the street called Straight Street .	end
Find the house of Judas and ask for a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus .	end
He is there now , praying .	end
He has seen a vision in which a man named Ananias came and laid his hands on him so that he could see again . ''	end
But Ananias answered , `` Lord , many people have told me about this man .	end
They told me about the many bad things he did to your holy people in Jerusalem .	end
Now he has come here to Damascus .	end
The leading priests have given him the power to arrest all people who trust in you . ''	end
But the Lord Jesus said to Ananias , `` Go !	end
I have chosen Saul for an important work .	end
He must tell about me to other nations and their rulers and to the people of Israel .	end
I will show him all that he must suffer for me . ''	end
So Ananias left and went to the house of Judas .	end
He laid his hands on Saul and said , `` Saul , my brother , the Lord Jesus sent me .	end
He is the one you saw on the road when you came here .	end
He sent me so that you can see again and also be filled with the Holy Spirit . ''	end
Immediately , something that looked like fish scales fell off Saul 's eyes .	end
He was able to see !	end
Then he got up and was baptized .	end
After he ate , he began to feel strong again .	end
Saul stayed with the followers of Jesus in Damascus for a few days .	end
Soon he began to go to the synagogues and tell people about Jesus .	end
He told the people , `` Jesus is the Son of God ! ''	end
All the people who heard Saul were amazed .	end
They said , `` This is the same man who was in Jerusalem trying to destroy the people who trust in Jesus !	end
And that 's why he has come here -- to arrest the followers of Jesus and take them back to the leading priests . ''	end
But Saul became more and more powerful in proving that Jesus is the Christ .	end
His proofs were so strong that the Jews who lived in Damascus could not argue with him .	end
After many days , some Jews made plans to kill Saul .	end
They were watching the city gates day and night .	end
They wanted to kill Saul , but he learned about their plan .	end
One night some followers that Saul had taught helped him leave the city .	end
They put him in a basket and lowered it down through a hole in the city wall .	end
Then Saul went to Jerusalem .	end
He tried to join the group of followers , but they were all afraid of him .	end
They did not believe that he was really a follower of Jesus .	end
But Barnabas accepted Saul and took him to the apostles .	end
He told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to Saul .	end
Then he told them how boldly Saul had spoken for the Lord in Damascus .	end
And so Saul stayed with the followers and went all around Jerusalem speaking boldly for the Lord .	end
He often had arguments with the Greek - speaking Jews , who began making plans to kill him .	end
When the believers learned about this , they took Saul to Caesarea , and from there they sent him to the city of Tarsus .	end
The church in Judea , Galilee , and Samaria had a time of peace .	end
With the help of the Holy Spirit , the groups of believers became stronger and showed their respect for the Lord by the way they lived .	end
So the church everywhere grew in numbers .	end
Peter was traveling through all the areas around Jerusalem , and he stopped to visit the believers who lived in Lydda .	end
There he met a man named Aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years .	end
Peter said to him , `` Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you .	end
Get up and make your bed ! ''	end
He stood up immediately .	end
All the people living in Lydda and on the plain of Sharon saw him , and they decided to follow the Lord .	end
In the city of Joppa there was a follower of Jesus named Tabitha .	end
Her Greek name , Dorcas , means `` a deer . ''	end
She was always doing good things for people and giving money to those in need .	end
While Peter was in Lydda , Tabitha became sick and died .	end
They washed her body and put it in an upstairs room .	end
The followers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda , which was not far away .	end
So they sent two men , who begged him , `` Hurry , please come quickly ! ''	end
Peter got ready and went with them .	end
When he arrived , they took him to the upstairs room .	end
All the widows stood around him .	end
They were crying and showing him the coats and other clothes that Tabitha had made during her time with them .	end
Peter sent all the people out of the room .	end
He knelt down and prayed .	end
Then he turned to Tabitha 's body and said , `` Tabitha , stand up ! ''	end
She opened her eyes .	end
When she saw Peter , she sat up .	end
He gave her his hand and helped her stand up .	end
Then he called the believers and the widows into the room .	end
He showed them Tabitha ; she was alive !	end
People everywhere in Joppa learned about this , and many believed in the Lord .	end
Peter stayed in Joppa for many days at the home of a man named Simon , who was a leatherworker .	end
The first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth .	end
This place was inside a tent .	end
The first area in the tent was called the Holy Place .	end
In the Holy Place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to God .	end
Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place .	end
In the Most Holy Place was a golden altar for burning incense .	end
And also there was the Box of the Agreement .	end
The Box was covered with gold .	end
Inside this Box was a golden jar of manna and Aaron 's rod -- the rod that once grew leaves .	end
Also in the Box were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments of the old agreement on them .	end
Above the Box were the Cherub angels that showed God 's glory .	end
These Cherub angels were over the place of mercy .	end
But we can not say everything about this now .	end
Everything in the tent was made ready in the way I have explained .	end
Then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .	end
But only the high priest could go into the second room , and he went in only once a year .	end
Also , he could never enter that room without taking blood with him .	end
He offered that blood to God for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning .	end
The Holy Spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the first room was still there .	end
This is an example for us today .	end
It shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to God are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear .	end
These gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings .	end
They are only rules about the body .	end
God gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way .	end
But Christ has already come to be the high priest .	end
He is the high priest of the good things we now have .	end
But Christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in .	end
He serves in a better place .	end
Unlike that tent , this one is perfect .	end
It was not made by anyone here on earth .	end
It does not belong to this world .	end
Christ entered the Most Holy Place only one time -- enough for all time .	end
He entered the Most Holy Place by using his own blood , not the blood of goats or young bulls .	end
He entered there and made us free from sin forever .	end
The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship .	end
The blood and ashes made them pure again -- but only their bodies .	end
So surely the blood sacrifice of Christ can do much more .	end
Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit as a perfect sacrifice to God .	end
His blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done .	end
It will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living God .	end
So Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people .	end
He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised , blessings that last forever .	end
This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement .	end
When someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead .	end
A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living .	end
It can be used only after that person 's death .	end
That is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between God and his people .	end
First , Moses told the people every command in the law .	end
Then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water .	end
He used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people .	end
Then he said , `` This is the blood that makes the agreement good -- the agreement that God commanded you to follow . ''	end
In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent .	end
He sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .	end
The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood .	end
Sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice .	end
These things are copies of the real things that are in heaven .	end
These copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices .	end
But the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices .	end
Christ went into the Most Holy Place .	end
But it was not the man - made one , which is only a copy of the real one .	end
He went into heaven , and he is there now before God to help us .	end
The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year .	end
He takes with him blood to offer .	end
But he does not offer his own blood like Christ did .	end
Christ went into heaven , but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again .	end
If Christ had offered himself many times , he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made .	end
But he came to offer himself only once .	end
And that once is enough for all time .	end
He came at a time when the world is nearing an end .	end
He came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice .	end
Everyone must die once .	end
Then they are judged .	end
So Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people .	end
And he will come a second time , but not to offer himself for sin .	end
He will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .	end
I am a free man .	end
I am an apostle .	end
I have seen Jesus our Lord .	end
You people are an example of my work in the Lord .	end
Others may not accept me as an apostle , but surely you do .	end
You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .	end
Some people want to judge me .	end
So this is the answer I give them : We have the right to eat and drink , do n't we ?	end
We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel , do n't we ?	end
The other apostles and the Lord 's brothers and Peter all do this .	end
And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?	end
No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary .	end
No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself .	end
No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself .	end
These are n't just my own thoughts .	end
God 's law says the same thing .	end
Yes , it is written in the Law of Moses : ``	end
When a work animal is being used to separate grain , do n't keep it from eating the grain . ''	end
When God said this , was he thinking only about work animals ?	end
No .	end
He was really talking about us .	end
Yes , that was written for us .	end
The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work .	end
We planted spiritual seed among you , so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life .	end
Surely that is not asking too much .	end
Others have this right to get things from you .	end
So surely we have this right too .	end
But we do n't use this right .	end
No , we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ .	end
Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple .	end
And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .	end
It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News .	end
The Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work .	end
But I have not used any of these rights , and I am not trying to get anything from you .	end
That is not my purpose for writing this .	end
I would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride .	end
It 's not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast .	end
That is my duty -- something I must do .	end
If I do n't tell people the Good News , I am in real trouble .	end
If I did it because it was my own choice , I would deserve to be paid .	end
But I have no choice .	end
I must tell the Good News .	end
So I am only doing the duty that was given to me .	end
So what do I get for doing it ?	end
My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work .	end
I am free .	end
I belong to no other person , but I make myself a slave to everyone .	end
I do this to help save as many people as I can .	end
To the Jews I became like a Jew so that I could help save Jews .	end
I myself am not ruled by the law , but to those who are ruled by the law I became like someone who is ruled by the law .	end
I did this to help save those who are ruled by the law .	end
To those who are without the law I became like someone who is without the law .	end
I did this to help save those who are without the law .	end
-LRB- But really , I am not without God 's law -- I am ruled by the law of Christ . -RRB-	end
To those who are weak , I became weak so that I could help save them .	end
I have become all things to all people .	end
I did this so that I could save people in any way possible .	end
I do all this to make the Good News known .	end
I do it so that I can share in the blessings of the Good News .	end
You know that in a race all the runners run , but only one runner gets the prize .	end
So run like that .	end
Run to win !	end
All who compete in the games use strict training .	end
They do this so that they can win a prize -- one that does n't last .	end
But our prize is one that will last forever .	end
So I run like someone who has a goal .	end
I fight like a boxer who is hitting something , not just the air .	end
It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want .	end
I do this so that I wo n't miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it .	end
The fifth angel blew his trumpet .	end
Then I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth .	end
The star was given the key to the deep hole that leads down to the bottomless pit .	end
Then the star opened the hole leading to the pit .	end
Smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace .	end
The sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .	end
Then locusts came out of the smoke and went down to the earth .	end
They were given the power to sting like scorpions .	end
They were told not to damage the fields of grass or any plant or tree .	end
They were to hurt only those who did not have God 's mark on their foreheads .	end
They were not given the power to kill them but only to cause them pain for five months -- pain like a person feels when stung by a scorpion .	end
During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it .	end
They will want to die , but death will hide from them .	end
The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle .	end
On their heads they wore something that looked like a gold crown .	end
Their faces looked like human faces .	end
Their hair was like women 's hair .	end
Their teeth were like lions ' teeth .	end
Their chests looked like iron breastplates .	end
The sound their wings made was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .	end
The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions .	end
The power they had to give people pain for five months was in their tails .	end
They had a ruler , who was the angel of the bottomless pit .	end
His name in Hebrew is Abaddon .	end
In Greek it is Apollyon .	end
The first terror is now past .	end
There are still two other terrors to come .	end
The sixth angel blew his trumpet .	end
Then I heard a voice coming from the horns on the four corners of the golden altar that is before God .	end
It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , `` Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates . ''	end
These four angels had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year .	end
The angels were set free to kill a third of all the people on the earth .	end
I heard how many troops on horses were in their army .	end
There were 200 , 000 , 000 .	end
In my vision , I saw the horses and the riders on the horses .	end
They looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur .	end
The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions .	end
The horses had fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .	end
A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues coming out of the horses ' mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .	end
The horses ' power was in their mouths and also in their tails .	end
Their tails were like snakes that have heads to bite and hurt people .	end
The other people on earth were not killed by these plagues .	end
But these people still did not change their hearts and turn away from worshiping the things they had made with their own hands .	end
They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood -- things that can not see or hear or walk .	end
They did not change their hearts and turn away from killing other people or from their evil magic , their sexual sins , and their stealing .	end
After this I heard what sounded like a large crowd of people in heaven .	end
The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !	end
Victory , glory , and power belong to our God .	end
His judgments are true and right .	end
Our God has punished the prostitute .	end
She is the one who ruined the earth with her sexual sin .	end
God has punished the prostitute to pay her back for the death of his servants . ''	end
These people also said , `` Hallelujah !	end
She is burning and her smoke will rise forever and ever . ''	end
Then the 24 elders and the four living beings bowed down .	end
They worshiped God , who sits on the throne .	end
They said , `` Amen !	end
Hallelujah ! ''	end
Then a voice came from the throne and said , `` Praise our God , all you who serve him !	end
Praise our God , all you small and great who honor him ! ''	end
Then I heard something that sounded like a large crowd of people .	end
It was as loud as crashing waves or claps of thunder .	end
The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !	end
Our Lord God rules .	end
He is the All - Powerful .	end
Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory !	end
Give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come .	end
And the Lamb 's bride has made herself ready .	end
Fine linen was given to the bride for her to wear .	end
The linen was bright and clean . ''	end
-LRB- The fine linen means the good things that God 's holy people did . -RRB-	end
Then the angel said to me , `` Write this : Great blessings belong to those who are invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ''	end
Then the angel said , `` These are the true words of God . ''	end
Then I bowed down before the angel 's feet to worship him .	end
But the angel said to me , `` Do n't worship me !	end
I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the truth of Jesus .	end
So worship God !	end
Because the truth of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . ''	end
Then I saw heaven open .	end
There before me was a white horse .	end
The rider on the horse was called Faithful and True , because he is right in his judging and in making war .	end
His eyes were like burning fire .	end
He had many crowns on his head .	end
A name was written on him , but he was the only one who knew its meaning .	end
He was dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and he was called the Word of God .	end
The armies of heaven were following the rider on the white horse .	end
They were also riding white horses .	end
They were dressed in fine linen , white and clean .	end
A sharp sword came out of the rider 's mouth , a sword that he would use to defeat the nations .	end
And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron .	end
He will crush the grapes in the winepress of the terrible anger of God All - Powerful .	end
On his robe and on his leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords Then I saw an angel standing in the sun .	end
In a loud voice the angel said to all the birds flying in the sky , `` Come together for the great supper of God .	end
Come together so that you can eat the bodies of rulers and army commanders and famous men .	end
Come to eat the bodies of the horses and their riders and the bodies of all people -- free , slave , small , and great . ''	end
Then I saw the beast and the rulers of the earth .	end
Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .	end
But the beast was captured , and the false prophet was also captured .	end
He was the one who did the miracles for the beast .	end
He had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its idol .	end
The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .	end
Their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse .	end
All the birds ate these bodies until they were full .	end
While Jesus was walking , he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born .	end
Jesus ' followers asked him , `` Teacher , why was this man born blind ?	end
Whose sin made it happen ?	end
Was it his own sin or that of his parents ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` It was not any sin of this man or his parents that caused him to be blind .	end
He was born blind so that he could be used to show what great things God can do .	end
While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me .	end
The night is coming , and no one can work at night .	end
While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ''	end
After Jesus said this , he spit on the dirt , made some mud and put it on the man 's eyes .	end
Jesus told him , `` Go and wash in Siloam pool . ''	end
-LRB- Siloam means `` Sent . '' -RRB-	end
So the man went to the pool , washed and came back .	end
He was now able to see .	end
His neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said , `` Look !	end
Is this the same man who always sits and begs ? ''	end
Some people said , `` Yes !	end
He is the one . ''	end
But others said , `` No , he ca n't be the same man .	end
He only looks like him . ''	end
So the man himself said , `` I am that same man . ''	end
They asked , `` What happened ?	end
How did you get your sight ? ''	end
He answered , `` The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes .	end
Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash .	end
So I went there and washed .	end
And then I could see . ''	end
They asked him , `` Where is this man ? ''	end
He answered , `` I do n't know . ''	end
Then the people brought the man to the Pharisees .	end
The day Jesus had made mud and healed the man 's eyes was a Sabbath day .	end
So the Pharisees asked the man , `` How did you get your sight ? ''	end
He answered , `` He put mud on my eyes .	end
I washed , and now I can see . ''	end
Some of the Pharisees said , `` That man does not obey the law about the Sabbath day .	end
So he is not from God . ''	end
Others said , `` But someone who is a sinner can not do these miraculous signs . ''	end
So they could not agree with each other .	end
They asked the man again , `` Since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ''	end
He answered , `` He is a prophet . ''	end
The Jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man -- that he was blind and was now healed .	end
But later they sent for his parents .	end
They asked them , `` Is this your son ?	end
You say he was born blind .	end
So how can he see ? ''	end
His parents answered , `` We know that this man is our son .	end
And we know that he was born blind .	end
But we do n't know why he can see now .	end
We do n't know who healed his eyes .	end
Ask him .	end
He is old enough to answer for himself . ''	end
They said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders .	end
The leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said Jesus was the Christ .	end
They would stop them from coming to the synagogue .	end
That is why his parents said , `` He is old enough .	end
Ask him . ''	end
So the Jewish leaders called the man who had been blind .	end
They told him to come in again .	end
They said , `` You should honor God by telling the truth .	end
We know that this man is a sinner . ''	end
The man answered , `` I do n't know if he is a sinner .	end
But I do know this : I was blind , and now I can see . ''	end
They asked , `` What did he do to you ?	end
How did he heal your eyes ? ''	end
He answered , `` I have already told you that .	end
But you would not listen to me .	end
Why do you want to hear it again ?	end
Do you want to be his followers too ? ''	end
At this they shouted insults at him and said , `` You are his follower , not us !	end
We are followers of Moses .	end
We know that God spoke to Moses .	end
But we do n't even know where this man comes from ! ''	end
The man answered , `` This is really strange !	end
You do n't know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes .	end
We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him .	end
This is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind .	end
This man must be from God .	end
If he were not from God , he could not do anything like this . ''	end
The Jewish leaders answered , `` You were born full of sin !	end
Are you trying to teach us ? ''	end
And they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out .	end
When Jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , `` Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ''	end
The man said , `` Tell me who he is , sir , so I can believe in him . ''	end
Jesus said to him , `` You have already seen him .	end
The Son of Man is the one talking with you now . ''	end
The man answered , `` Yes , I believe , Lord ! ''	end
Then he bowed and worshiped Jesus .	end
Jesus said , `` I came into this world so that the world could be judged .	end
I came so that people who are blind could see .	end
And I came so that people who think they see would become blind . ''	end
Some of the Pharisees were near Jesus .	end
They heard him say this .	end
They asked , `` What ?	end
Are you saying that we are blind too ? ''	end
Jesus said , `` If you were really blind , you would not be guilty of sin .	end
But you say that you see , so you are still guilty . ''	end
Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped .	end
The soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head .	end
Then they put a purple robe around him .	end
They kept coming up to him and saying , `` Hail to the king of the Jews ! ''	end
And they hit him in the face .	end
Again Pilate came out and said to the Jewish leaders , `` Look !	end
I am bringing Jesus out to you .	end
I want you to know that I find nothing I can charge him with . ''	end
Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe .	end
Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is the man ! ''	end
When the leading priests and the Jewish guards saw Jesus they shouted , `` Kill him on a cross !	end
Kill him on a cross ! ''	end
But Pilate answered , `` You take him and nail him to a cross yourselves .	end
I find nothing I can charge him with . ''	end
The Jewish leaders answered , `` We have a law that says he must die , because he said he is the Son of God . ''	end
When Pilate heard this , he was more afraid .	end
So he went back inside the palace and asked Jesus , `` Where are you from ? ''	end
But Jesus did not answer him .	end
Pilate said , `` You refuse to speak to me ?	end
Remember , I have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . ''	end
Jesus answered , `` The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God .	end
So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . ''	end
After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go free .	end
But the Jewish leaders shouted , `` Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar .	end
So if you let this man go free , that means you are not Caesar 's friend . ''	end
When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out to the place called `` The Stone Pavement . ''	end
-LRB- In Aramaic the name is Gabbatha . -RRB-	end
Pilate sat down on the judge 's seat there .	end
It was now almost noon on Preparation day of Passover week .	end
Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is your king ! ''	end
They shouted , `` Take him away !	end
Take him away !	end
Kill him on a cross ! ''	end
Pilate asked them , `` Do you want me to kill your king on a cross ? ''	end
The leading priests answered , `` The only king we have is Caesar ! ''	end
So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be killed on a cross .	end
The soldiers took Jesus .	end
He carried his own cross to a place called `` The Place of the Skull . ''	end
-LRB- In Aramaic the name of this place is `` Golgotha . '' -RRB-	end
There they nailed Jesus to the cross .	end
They also nailed two other men to crosses .	end
They put them on each side of Jesus with him in the middle .	end
Pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross .	end
The sign said , `` jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews . ''	end
The sign was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek .	end
Many of the Jews read this sign , because the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross was near the city .	end
The leading Jewish priests said to Pilate , `` Do n't write , ' The King of the Jews . '	end
But write , ' This man said , I am the King of the Jews . ' ''	end
Pilate answered , `` I will not change what I have written . ''	end
After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts .	end
Each soldier got one part .	end
They also took his tunic .	end
It was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom .	end
So the soldiers said to each other , `` We should not tear this into parts .	end
Let 's throw lots to see who will get it . ''	end
This happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Scriptures say : `` They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for what I was wearing . ''	end
So the soldiers did this .	end
Jesus ' mother stood near his cross .	end
Her sister was also standing there with Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .	end
Jesus saw his mother .	end
He also saw the follower he loved very much standing there .	end
He said to his mother , `` Dear woman , here is your son . ''	end
Then he said to the follower , `` Here is your mother . ''	end
So after that , this follower took Jesus ' mother to live in his home .	end
Later , Jesus knew that everything had been done .	end
To make the Scriptures come true he said , `` I am thirsty . ''	end
There was a jar full of sour wine there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it .	end
They put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus ' mouth .	end
When he tasted the wine , he said , `` It is finished . ''	end
Then he bowed his head and died .	end
This day was Preparation day .	end
The next day was a special Sabbath day .	end
The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day .	end
So they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken .	end
And they asked that the bodies be taken down from the crosses .	end
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men on the crosses beside Jesus .	end
But when the soldiers came close to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead .	end
So they did not break his legs .	end
But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus '	end
side .	end
Immediately blood and water came out .	end
-LRB- The one who saw this happen has told about it .	end
He told about it so that you also can believe .	end
The things he says are true .	end
He knows that he tells the truth . -RRB-	end
These things happened to give full meaning to the Scriptures that said , `` None of his bones will be broken ''	end
and `` People will look at the one they stabbed . ''	end
Later , a man named Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus .	end
-LRB- Joseph was a follower of Jesus , but he did not tell anyone , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . -RRB-	end
Pilate said Joseph could take Jesus ' body , so he came and took it away .	end
Nicodemus went with Joseph .	end
He was the man who had come to Jesus before and talked to him at night .	end
He brought about 100 pounds of spices -- a mixture of myrrh and aloes .	end
These two men took Jesus ' body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices .	end
-LRB- This is how the Jews bury people . -RRB-	end
In the place where Jesus was killed on the cross , there was a garden .	end
In the garden there was a new tomb .	end
No one had ever been buried there before .	end
The men put Jesus in that tomb because it was near , and the Jews were preparing to start their Sabbath day .	end
Jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town .	end
Some people brought to him a man who was paralyzed and was lying on a mat .	end
Jesus saw that these people had much faith .	end
So he said to the paralyzed man , `` Young man , you will be glad to hear this .	end
Your sins are forgiven . ''	end
Some of the teachers of the law heard what Jesus said .	end
They said to themselves , `` What an insult to God for this man to say that ! ''	end
Jesus knew what they were thinking .	end
So he said , `` Why are you thinking such evil thoughts ?	end
The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins .	end
But how can I prove this to you ?	end
Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say , ' Your sins are forgiven . '	end
There 's no proof that it really happened .	end
But what if I say to the man , ' Stand up and walk ' ?	end
Then you will be able to see that I really have this power . ''	end
So Jesus said to the paralyzed man , `` Stand up .	end
Take your mat and go home . ''	end
The man stood up and went home .	end
The people saw this and they were amazed .	end
They praised God for letting someone have such power .	end
When Jesus was leaving , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the place for collecting taxes .	end
Jesus said to him , `` Follow me . ''	end
So he got up and followed Jesus .	end
Jesus ate dinner at Matthew 's house .	end
Many tax collectors and others with bad reputations came and ate with him and his followers .	end
The Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with these people .	end
They asked his followers , `` Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners ? ''	end
Jesus heard them say this .	end
So he said to them , `` It is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy .	end
You need to go and learn what this Scripture means : ' I do n't want animal sacrifices ; I want you to show kindness to people . '	end
I did not come to invite good people .	end
I came to invite sinners . ''	end
Then the followers of John came to Jesus and said , `` We and the Pharisees fast often , but your followers do n't ever fast .	end
Why ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` At a wedding the friends of the bridegroom are not sad while he is with them .	end
They can not fast then .	end
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them .	end
Then they will fast .	end
`` When someone sews a patch over a hole in an old coat , they never use a piece of cloth that has not already been shrunk .	end
If they do , the patch will shrink and pull away from the coat .	end
Then the hole will be worse .	end
Also , people never pour new wine into old wineskins .	end
They would break , the wine would spill out , and the wineskins would be ruined .	end
People always put new wine into new wineskins , which wo n't break , and the wine stays good . ''	end
While Jesus was still talking , a leader of the synagogue came to him .	end
The leader bowed down before him and said , `` My daughter has just died .	end
But if you will come and touch her with your hand , she will live again . ''	end
So Jesus and his followers went with the man .	end
On the way , there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years .	end
She came close behind Jesus and touched the bottom of his coat .	end
She was thinking , `` If I can touch his coat , I will be healed . ''	end
Jesus turned and saw the woman .	end
He said , `` Be happy , dear woman .	end
You are made well because you believed . ''	end
Then the woman was healed .	end
Jesus continued going with the Jewish leader and went into the leader 's house .	end
He saw people there who make music for funerals .	end
And he saw a crowd of people crying loudly .	end
Jesus said , `` Go away .	end
The girl is not dead .	end
She is only sleeping . ''	end
But the people laughed at him .	end
After the people were put out of the house , Jesus went into the girl 's room .	end
He held the girl 's hand , and the girl stood up .	end
The news about this spread all around the area .	end
As Jesus was going away from there , two blind men followed him .	end
They said loudly , `` Show kindness to us , Son of David . ''	end
Jesus went inside , and the blind men went with him .	end
He asked them , `` Do you believe that I am able to make you see again ? ''	end
They answered , `` Yes , Lord , we believe . ''	end
Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , `` You believe that I can make you see again , so it will happen . ''	end
Then the men were able to see .	end
Jesus gave them a strong warning .	end
He said , `` Do n't tell anyone about this . ''	end
But they left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area .	end
As these two men were leaving , some people brought another man to Jesus .	end
This man could not talk because he had a demon inside him .	end
Jesus forced the demon out , and the man was able to talk .	end
The people were amazed and said , `` We have never seen anything like this in Israel . ''	end
But the Pharisees said , `` The ruler of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out . ''	end
Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages .	end
He taught in their synagogues and told people the Good News about God 's kingdom .	end
He healed all kinds of diseases and sicknesses .	end
Jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless -- like sheep without a shepherd to lead them .	end
Jesus said to his followers , `` There is such a big harvest of people to bring in .	end
But there are only a few workers to help harvest them .	end
God owns the harvest .	end
Ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest . ''	end
After Jesus said all these things , he left Galilee .	end
He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River .	end
Many people followed him .	end
Jesus healed the sick people there .	end
Some Pharisees came to Jesus .	end
They tried to make him say something wrong .	end
They asked him , `` Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` Surely you have read this in the Scriptures : When God made the world , ' he made people male and female . '	end
And God said , ' That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .	end
And the two people will become one . '	end
So they are no longer two , but one .	end
God has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ''	end
The Pharisees asked , `` Then why did Moses give a command allowing a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept God 's teaching .	end
But divorce was not allowed in the beginning .	end
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for the problem of sexual sin , and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . ''	end
The followers said to Jesus , `` If that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry . ''	end
He answered , `` This statement is true for some , but not for everyone -- only for those who have been given this gift .	end
There are different reasons why some men do n't marry .	end
Some were born without the ability to produce children .	end
Others were made that way later in life .	end
And others have given up marriage because of God 's kingdom .	end
This is for anyone who is able to accept it . ''	end
Then the people brought their little children to Jesus so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them and pray for them .	end
When the followers saw this , they told the people to stop bringing their children to him .	end
But Jesus said , `` Let the little children come to me .	end
Do n't stop them , because God 's kingdom belongs to people who are like these children . ''	end
After Jesus blessed the children , he left there .	end
A man came to Jesus and asked , `` Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` Why do you ask me about what is good ?	end
Only God is good .	end
But if you want to have eternal life , obey the law 's commands . ''	end
The man asked , `` Which ones ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` ' You must not murder anyone , you must not commit adultery , you must not steal , you must not tell lies about others , you must respect your father and mother , ' and ' love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ' ''	end
The young man said , `` I have obeyed all these commands .	end
What else do I need ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` If you want to be perfect , then go and sell all that you own .	end
Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven .	end
Then come and follow me ! ''	end
But when the young man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money , he was sad .	end
He did n't want to do this , because he was very rich .	end
So he left .	end
Then Jesus said to his followers , `` The truth is , it will be very hard for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom .	end
Yes , I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom . ''	end
The followers were amazed to hear this .	end
They asked , `` Then who can be saved ? ''	end
Jesus looked at them and said , `` This is something that people can not do .	end
But God can do anything . ''	end
Peter said to him , `` We left everything we had and followed you .	end
So what will we have ? ''	end
Jesus said to them , `` When the time of the new world comes , the Son of Man will sit on his great and glorious throne .	end
And I can promise that you who followed me will sit on twelve thrones , and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel .	end
Everyone who has left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms to follow me will get much more than they left .	end
And they will have eternal life .	end
Many people who are first now will be last in the future .	end
And many who are last now will be first in the future .	end
Then Jesus said , `` Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom come with power before you die . ''	end
Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John and went up on a high mountain .	end
They were all alone there .	end
While these followers watched him , Jesus was changed .	end
His clothes became shining white -- whiter than anyone on earth could make them .	end
Then two men were there talking with Jesus .	end
They were Elijah and Moses .	end
Peter said to Jesus , `` Teacher , it is good that we are here .	end
We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''	end
Peter did not know what to say , because he and the other two followers were so afraid .	end
Then a cloud came and covered them .	end
A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son , the one I love .	end
Obey him ! ''	end
The followers looked , but they saw only Jesus there alone with them .	end
As Jesus and the followers were walking back down the mountain , he gave them these instructions : `` Do n't tell anyone about what you saw on the mountain .	end
Wait until after the Son of Man rises from death .	end
Then you can tell people what you saw . ''	end
So the followers waited to say anything about what they saw .	end
But they discussed among themselves what Jesus meant about rising from death .	end
They asked him , `` Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` They are right to say that Elijah must come first .	end
Elijah makes all things the way they should be .	end
But why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will think he is worth nothing ?	end
I tell you that Elijah has already come .	end
And people did to him all the bad things they wanted to do .	end
The Scriptures said this would happen to him . ''	end
Then Jesus , Peter , James , and John went to the other followers .	end
They saw many people around them .	end
The teachers of the law were arguing with the followers .	end
When the people saw Jesus , they were very surprised and ran to welcome him .	end
Jesus asked , `` What are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? ''	end
A man answered , `` Teacher , I brought my son to you .	end
He is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps him from talking .	end
The spirit attacks him and throws him on the ground .	end
He foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes very stiff .	end
I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they could not . ''	end
Jesus answered , `` You people today do n't believe !	end
How long must I stay with you ?	end
How long must I be patient with you ?	end
Bring the boy to me ! ''	end
So the followers brought the boy to Jesus .	end
When the evil spirit saw Jesus , it attacked the boy .	end
The boy fell down and rolled on the ground .	end
He was foaming at the mouth .	end
Jesus asked the boy 's father , `` How long has this been happening to him ? ''	end
The father answered , `` Since he was very young .	end
The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him .	end
If you can do anything , please have pity on us and help us . ''	end
Jesus said to the father , `` Why did you say ' if you can ' ?	end
All things are possible for the one who believes . ''	end
Immediately the father shouted , `` I do believe .	end
Help me to believe more ! ''	end
Jesus saw that all the people were running there to see what was happening .	end
So he spoke to the evil spirit .	end
He said , `` You evil spirit that makes this boy deaf and stops him from talking -- I command you to come out of him and never enter him again ! ''	end
The evil spirit screamed .	end
It caused the boy to fall on the ground again , and then it came out .	end
The boy looked as if he was dead .	end
Many people said , `` He is dead ! ''	end
But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .	end
Then Jesus went into the house .	end
His followers were alone with him there .	end
They said , `` Why were n't we able to force that evil spirit out ? ''	end
Jesus answered , `` That kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . ''	end
Then Jesus and his followers left there and went through Galilee .	end
Jesus did not want the people to know where they were .	end
He wanted to teach his followers alone .	end
He said to them , `` The Son of Man will be handed over to the control of other men , who will kill him .	end
After three days , he will rise from death . ''	end
But the followers did not understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him .	end
Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum .	end
They went into a house , and Jesus said to them , `` I heard you arguing on the way here today .	end
What were you arguing about ? ''	end
But the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .	end
Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him .	end
He said , `` Whoever wants to be the most important must make others more important than themselves .	end
They must serve everyone else . ''	end
Then Jesus took a small child and stood the child in front of the followers .	end
He held the child in his arms and said , `` Whoever accepts children like these in my name is accepting me .	end
And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . ''	end
Then John said , `` Teacher , we saw a man using your name to force demons out of someone .	end
He is not one of us .	end
So we told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group . ''	end
Jesus said , `` Do n't stop him .	end
Whoever uses my name to do powerful things will not soon say bad things about me .	end
Whoever is not against us is with us .	end
I can assure you that anyone who helps you by giving you a drink of water because you belong to the Christ will definitely get a reward .	end
`` If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it will be very bad for that person .	end
It would be better for them to have a millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the sea .	end
If your hand makes you sin , cut it off .	end
It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two hands and go to hell .	end
There the fire never stops .	end
If your foot makes you sin , cut it off .	end
It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two feet and be thrown into hell .	end
If your eye makes you sin , take it out .	end
It is better for you to have only one eye and enter God 's kingdom than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .	end
The worms that eat the people in hell never die .	end
The fire there is never stopped .	end
`` Everyone will be salted with fire .	end
`` Salt is good .	end
But if it loses its salty taste , you ca n't make it good again .	end
So , do n't lose that good quality of salt you have .	end
And live in peace with each other . ''	end
I am in Christ and I am telling you the truth .	end
I am not lying .	end
And my conscience , ruled by the Holy Spirit , agrees that what I say now is true .	end
I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for my own people .	end
They are my brothers and sisters , my earthly family .	end
I wish I could help them .	end
I would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from Christ if that would help them .	end
They are the people of Israel , God 's chosen children .	end
They have the glory of God and the agreements he made between himself and his people .	end
God gave them the Law of Moses , the Temple worship , and his promises .	end
They are the descendants of our great fathers , and they are the earthly family of Christ .	end
And Christ is God over all things .	end
Praise him forever !	end
Amen .	end
I do n't mean that God failed to keep his promise to the Jewish people .	end
But only some of the people of Israel are really God 's people .	end
And only some of Abraham 's descendants are true children of Abraham .	end
This is what God said to Abraham : `` Your true descendants will be those who come through Isaac . ''	end
This means that not all of Abraham 's descendants are God 's true children .	end
Abraham 's true children are those who become God 's children because of the promise he made to Abraham .	end
Here is what God said in that promise : `` About this time next year I will come back , and Sarah will have a son . ''	end
And that is not all .	end
Rebecca also had sons , and they had the same father .	end
He is our father Isaac .	end
But before the two sons were born , God told Rebecca , `` The older son will serve the younger . ''	end
This was before the boys had done anything good or bad .	end
God said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of God 's own plan .	end
He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call , not because of anything the boys did .	end
As the Scriptures say , `` I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau . ''	end
So what does this mean ?	end
That God is not fair ?	end
We can not say that .	end
God said to Moses , `` I will show mercy to anyone I want to show mercy to .	end
I will show pity to anyone I choose . ''	end
So God will choose anyone he decides to show mercy to , and his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do .	end
In the Scriptures God says to Pharaoh : `` I made you king so that you could do this for me .	end
I wanted to show my power through you .	end
I wanted my name to be announced throughout the world . ''	end
So God shows mercy to those he wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn .	end
So one of you will ask me , `` If God controls what we do , why does he blame us for our sins ? ''	end
Do n't ask that .	end
You are only human and have no right to question God .	end
A clay jar does not question the one who made it .	end
It does not say , `` Why did you make me like this ? ''	end
The one who makes the jar can make anything he wants .	end
He uses the same clay to make different things .	end
He might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use .	end
It is the same way with what God has done .	end
He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power .	end
But he patiently endured those he was angry with -- people who were ready to be destroyed .	end
He waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy .	end
God has already prepared them to share his glory .	end
We are those people , the ones God chose not only from the Jews but also from those who are not Jews .	end
As the Scriptures say in the book of Hosea , `` The people who are not mine -- I will say they are my people .	end
And the people I did not love -- I will say they are the people I love . ''	end
And , `` Where God said in the past , ' You are not my people ' -- there they will be called children of the living God . ''	end
And Isaiah cries out about Israel : `` There are so many people of Israel , they are like the grains of sand by the sea .	end
But only a few of them will be saved .	end
Yes , the Lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth . ''	end
It is just as Isaiah said : `` The Lord All - Powerful allowed some of our people to live .	end
If he had not done that , we would now be like Sodom , and we would be like Gomorrah . ''	end
So what does all this mean ?	end
It means that people who are not Jews were made right with God because of their faith , even though they were not trying to make themselves right .	end
And the people of Israel , who tried to make themselves right with God by following the law , did not succeed .	end
They failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did .	end
They did not trust in God to make them right .	end
They fell over the stone that makes people fall .	end
The Scriptures talk about that stone : `` Look , I put in Zion a stone that will make people stumble .	end
It is a rock that will make people fall .	end
But anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ''	end

" There 's a lot more than you 'd think to growing wax apples , " says local farmer Chen Sheng - tzung .	Chen Sheng - tzung ! person ;

The wax apple is a tropical fruit originating from the Malay peninsula .	Malay ! national ;
The Dutch brought it to Taiwan from Java , in the 17th century , and it became commonly grown as a shade - giving tree .	Dutch ! national ; Taiwan ! country ; Java ! country ; the 17th century ! date ;
Old folk in the South remember when wax apples were " just something to munch on " - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to .	South ! location ;
But wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years , thanks to advances in the way that they are grown .	the past 30 years ! date ;
For example , the " bag - wrap " method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to Linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin .	Linpien ! country ; 1994 ! date ;
The method soon caught on throughout the district .	end
Another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields .	end
This reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees , causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit .	end
The net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit .	end
As a result of this technique , black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year .	most of the year ! date ;
The " black pearl " tag did n't originate in Linpien , but it was Linpien wax apples that made the variety famous and prompted the dramatic growth of its market .	Linpien ! country ; Linpien ! country ;

How does a small town like Linpien come to be home to such a well - organized volunteer effort , and just how did the volunteers set about giving their town a make - over ?	Linpien ! country ;
The story begins with the town 's riverside park .	end
The road linking the town 's main street with the riverside park , where locals like to stroll and chat at the beginning and end of the day , used to be overgrown and lined with trash .	end
Now , however , thanks to a coordinated effort involving volunteers , residents and landlords , the verges are planted with sunflowers and lantana , while a former mud patch , donated rent - free by its owner , has been converted into a carp - filled lotus pool .	end

Tips for Getting through Middle Age	end

Middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .	end
Many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges .	end
A minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap .	end
Middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest .	end
As a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked .	end
Middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that 's easiest to overlook .	those years between 40 and 60 ! date ;
In comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy .	end
Even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases .	Chiu Chia - li ! person ; the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center ! org ;
Social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems .	end
This is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings .	end
But by keeping everything inside , they may cause irreparable harm to their health .	end
In recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked .	end
How do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ?	end
Here are a few suggestions :	end
1. Live well at every stage of life	1. ! num ;
Li Liang - che , a professor of psychology at National Chengchi University , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology .	Li Liang - che ! person ; National Chengchi University ! org ;
He points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age .	end
Smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier .	end
In other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life .	end
Foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble .	end
Is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ?	end

Are you worried about losing your job ?	end

Are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ?	end
Then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves .	end
There are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start .	end
Otherwise , you 'll end up being overwhelmed .	end
2. Start over	2. ! num ;
In China it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was " heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity . "	China ! country ;
But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .	end
To assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised .	end
Hence , it is necessary to cast aside one 's old self and start over .	end
Chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized , but they do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws .	Chiu ! person ;
Stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history .	end
With each new era , role models change .	end
Until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility .	end
For instance , today 's middle - aged Chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .	Chinese ! national ;
They set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large .	end
Many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers .	end
Their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves .	two ! num ;
Then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire .	end
And there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional Chinese wife and mother .	Chinese ! national ;
Ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves .	end
3. Turn the focus from outside to inside	3. ! num ;
Life is a process that moves from the " outward " to the " inward , " says Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , getting to the heart of the matter .	Alice Lu ! person ; the International Family Life Education Center ! org ;
Lu explains that as children people yearn for the affection of their parents ; as adolescents they want the affirmation of their peers ; and as adults , they set their sights on educational qualifications , finding a good job , making money , marrying a good spouse and so forth .	Lu ! person ;
Everyone puts the emphasis on outward manifestations of success , and this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement continues up to middle age .	end
" By middle age , people have gotten from the outside world just about all they can , " says Lu .	Lu ! person ;
" What they have n't attained yet they probably wo n't attain ever , so it 's not worth getting all worked up about it .	end
This is the time of life when the doubts set in . "	end
Many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves , " Is this really what I want ?	end
What has been the point of all my hard striving ? "	end
When the doubts come , some people continue trying to find answers from outside , thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives !	end
But then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they 've just made things worse .	end
" In middle age you start to listen to what 's going on inside , " says Lu .	Lu ! person ;
" It 's the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul . "	end
People ask themselves : Am I truly happy ?	end
Do I like the person I see in the mirror ?	end
Why ?	end
What dreams can I pursue ?	end
At this point , there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards .	end
Instead it 's more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance .	end
" One need not compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , " notes Chiu .	Chiu ! person ;
Everyone 's circumstances and personalities are different , and they place different expectations on themselves .	end
It 's not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need to follow the currents of fashion .	end
Everyone is unique .	end

In the modern age when people value different things , you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success .	end
4. Realistically strive for one 's dreams	4. ! num ;
When focusing inward , many dreams that have long been discarded will end up floating to the surface .	end
At such times , one should remember to ask oneself three questions :	three ! num ;
" What do I want ? " " What can I do ? " And " What must I do and have ? "	end
Chang Der - chung reminds people to think clearly about their needs , and then think about the costs .	Chang Der - chung ! person ;
Will meeting these personal needs necessarily come into conflict with meeting one 's responsibilities ?	end
Is there some way that the two can be accomplished simultaneously ?	end
When facing problems at work in Taiwan , many people decide to change careers or even to pursue their fortunes in mainland China or Southeast Asia .	Taiwan ! country ; China ! country ; Southeast Asia ! location ;
Pursuing some dream of really making it big , many men use up their savings , leaving their wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land .	end
There 's no right or wrong here , and there 's no way to guarantee a venture will be successful , but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes , so that one wo n't suffer losses larger than one can bear .	end
" It is indeed the case that when one is young , one 's quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound , so that one can shoot at will , " says Chang by way of analogy .	Chang ! person ;
" Once you get into middle age , you 've got to make every arrow count . "	end
Chang explains that everyone has dreams , and that continually working toward those dreams is an excellent method of relieving stress at any age .	Chang ! person ;
Middle - aged people have heavy burdens , and sometimes they may feel as if they are suffocating under them .	end
" But accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change . "	end
If you make an effort to do what you can , you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened .	end
Chang cites this example : Say you hate being tied up by your work , and would like to go back to school .	Chang ! person ;
Why do n't you try a weekend class ?	end
Maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety .	end
Or if you are a housewife , taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full - time job , then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization .	three ! num ;
This would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment .	end
And you can help to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by making a habit of regularly exercising .	end
What 's more , do n't worry too much about time being short .	end
Remember that most modern people live long lives that can be divided up into many stages .	end
In middle age , when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society , decide which of your problems are the most urgent .	end
Do n't try to accomplish all of your dreams at once .	end
Maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for opportunities to present themselves .	end
5. Change your perspective	5. ! num ;
In middle age , one 's life is already half over , and one has already amply tasted of life 's fruits , both the bitter and the sweet .	end
" I am thankful for the bad times , for they have given me more insight into life and a better opportunity to understand myself , " says Lin Hung - kuei , an I - kuan Tao devotee , who has studied the Book of Changes and fengshui .	Lin Hung - kuei ! person ; the Book of Changes ! art ;
Taking care of your parents , losing your job , illness and even being cheated out of money can be embraced as opportunities to experience life .	end
They are lessons that the middle - aged learn from to become more proficient at the art of living .	end
" By changing perspective , you can understand the insignificance of your problems , " points out Chiu Chia - li .	Chiu Chia - li ! person ;
It is very important to adjust your frame of mind .	end
You should n't think that there is only one way that you can be .	end
As long as you can accept yourself , then everything is all right .	end
As for losing your job in middle age , some people make NT$ 100,000 and it 's not enough .	NT$ 100,000 ! money ;
Other's find that NT$ 20,000 is more than enough to support the family .	NT$ 20,000 ! money ;
The problem is that by insisting on making NT$ 100,000 a month , you may pass by a suitable job that pays NT$ 20,000 .	NT$ 100,000 ! money ; NT$ 20,000 ! money ;
Chang also notes that when people come to forks in the road when they reach middle age , they may look around in all directions and feel at a loss , but they 've got to encourage themselves to keep pressing ahead .	Chang ! person ;
" Even if you feel uncertain , it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty . "	end
At the very least , you 've got to work hard at establishing a sense of direction .	end
When Li Liang - che starts feeling sorry for himself , he uses the age - old method of considering those who are even worse off .	Li Liang - che ! person ;
Those people who are always complaining about their lot in life should take a walk around a cancer ward , " Li says .	Li ! person ;
Then they 'll realize how lucky they are . "	end
Chiu Chia - li , on the other hand , encourages the middle - aged not to close themselves off .	Chiu Chia - li ! person ;
They must get out and make friends , so as to get things off their chests and find support from each other .	end
This makes it easier to get through the bad times .	end
Finally , there is something that may seem a little cliched but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better , that tomorrow is another day .	end
" Whether you are depressed or going berserk , it 's important to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of the middle - aged , " says Chang .	Chang ! person ;
Much like rebellious adolescents , they may merely need to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again .	end
Do n't give up hope too early , and do n't be afraid of asking for assistance .	end
When you feel at a loss emotionally , the experts will be able to help .	end

A " fever chip " bearing the DNA of common fever - causing viruses and bacteria could be used to determine the cause of the fever and the type of pathogen involved would be a valuable tool .	end
However , Pan points out that because of the difficulties in substantially reducing the time needed for sample preparation , the usefulness of such a fever chip is still limited , so that it can not yet be widely promoted .	Pan ! person ;

Johnsee Lee says that according to US market research estimates , the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips is currently around 250,000 ; in two years this is expected to grow to 1.2 million .	Johnsee Lee ! person ; US ! country ; 250,000 ! num ; two years ! date ; 1.2 million ! num ;

Thus some people have set their sights on the biochip market , and believe that following Taiwan 's success in the semiconductor field , the island could go on to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips .	Taiwan ! country ;
Be that as it may , the small number of biochip companies so far established in Taiwan still find their market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers .	Taiwan ! country ;
Although they are also actively developing overseas markets , what interests them most is not biochips per se , nor are they content merely to be contract manufacturers .	end
" The chips are only a tool , and the big money is not in chip sales .	end

TGS 's strategy is to invest in a number of US genome research companies , and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them .	TGS ! org ; US ! country ;
Kuo comments that contract production of chips is merely a service activity and a source of income for the company - TGS 's ultimate goal is in doing R&D work to identify gene sequences as targets for developing new drugs .	Kuo ! person ; TGS ! org ;

However , the potential uses for biochips go far beyond the medical applications outlined above .	end
Dr. Johnsee Lee , who as well as heading up the Biomedical Engineering Center is also general director of Union Chemical Laboratories , a research institute under the ITRI umbrella , says that due to biochips ' advantages of miniaturization , parallelism , speed and the ability to reveal the " big picture , " they have a very wide range of applications .	Johnsee Lee ! person ; the Biomedical Engineering Center ! org ; Union Chemical Laboratories ! org ; ITRI ! org ;
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .	end
Biochips come in two main types : the microfluidics chip or " lab - on - a - chip , " and the microarray chip or " DNA chip . "	end
Microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology , microelectronics , micromachining and other technologies to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form .	end
Meanwhile on microarray chips , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots .	end
BMEC researcher Pan Chao - chi uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of chips .	BMEC ! org ; Pan Chao - chi ! person ;
To test a blood sample using a microarray chip , the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the " hybridization " reaction takes place .	end
Finally , the results are analyzed using a detection system .	end
Hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory .	end
In contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result .	end
At present , microfluidics technology is not yet mature , and no such chips have been launched as commercial products anywhere .	end
But , says Pan Chao - chih : " This is the way future biochip development will go . "	Pan Chao - chih ! person ;
The poor man 's chip	The poor man 's chip ! art ;
Future prospects also seem infinite for microarray chips , which are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments .	end
Jerry Huang notes that DNA chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology .	Jerry Huang ! person ;
On one little biochip , tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes .	one ! num ; tens of thousands ! num ; tens of thousands ! num ;
In other words , whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually , today , using biochips , they can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once .	tens of thousands ! num ;
In particular , biochips not only can speed the pace of research , but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments , with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the chip .	end
Thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick , but also more humane .	end
Dr. Konan Peck , an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences -LRB- IBMS -RRB- , says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool .	Konan Peck ! person ; Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences ! org ; IBMS ! org ;
With this in mind , Peck has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called " the poor man 's biochip , " since they cost a third less than glass chips .	Peck ! person ; a third ! num ;

Can Taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?	Taiwan ! country ;
BMEC director Johnsee Lee observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited .	BMEC ! org ; Johnsee Lee ! person ;
However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .	Taiwan ! country ;
Thus , says Lee , " Taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "	Lee ! person ; Taiwan ! country ;
The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome .	end
Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .	end
" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says Johnsee Lee .	Johnsee Lee ! person ;
In his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .	end
In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .	end
At present , the BMEC has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications .	BMEC ! org ; 10 ! num ;
Pushing the envelope	end
Although at their present stage of development , biochips are already a great help to researchers , they are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives .	end
But one day they will play an important role in all our lives .	end
" Applications and commercialization are our goal , " says Johnsee Lee .	Johnsee Lee ! person ;
He says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback .	end
Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .	end
Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .	Lee ! person ;
He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .	one to two years ! date ; around three years ! date ;
IBMS associate research fellow Konan Peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future .	IBMS ! org ; Konan Peck ! person ;
But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable .	end
Mankind is always challenging his limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases , the next challenge will have only just begun .	end

Uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .	end
Right , right , right .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Well , like Professor Zhou , I also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone SMS .	Zhou ! person ;
At that time , , it can be said that this SMS was among the many , ha , SMS containing New Year wishes , like Happy New Year , received after the start of the New Year .	New Year ! thing ; New Year ! thing ; the New Year ! thing ;

Although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , I think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news .	end
Yes , exceptionally .	end
Yes , exceptionally .	end
Well , what in fact was the content of that SMS ?	end
Let 's take a look via this footage , ha .	end
I remember the SMS was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road , Jingguang Bridge , and East Third Ring Road , and requesting cars to make a detour .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Chaoyang Road ! fact ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ;

Furthermore , there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .	one ! num ;
Ah , after the SMS was sent , , I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality , ah , used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency .	first ! order ; Beijing Municipality ! country ;
I do n't know , all of us are living in Beijing , is this the first time , Professor Zhou ?	Beijing ! country ; first ! order ; Zhou ! person ;
Yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 .	first ! order ; 1860 ! num ;
Uh-huh .	end
Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news .	end
Yes .	end
Other places in the country must have used this too .	end
Uh-huh , uh-huh .	end
Must have used this too .	end
Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent .	last year ! date ; Beijing ! country ;
Uh-huh .	end
However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?	end
Yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by Beijing Municipality , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .	Beijing Municipality ! org ;
Uh-huh .	end
For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .	end
In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .	end
We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .	end
Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .	end
Right .	end
It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .	end
Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as , these electronic signatures .	end
These are quite sophisticated forms .	end
Uh-huh .	end
In particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government .	end
Hence , I think this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah .	2003 ! date ;
Uh-huh .	end
They said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .	end
Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Yes .	end
We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang .	Beijing ! country ; Yang Yang ! person ;
If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?	that day ! date ;
Yes .	end
Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis .	end
This is the most appropriate word to use .	end
Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well .	China ! country ;
Why is that so ?	end
This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage .	China ! country ;
There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah .	China ! country ;
So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .	end
Yes , I noticed that many friends , around me received it .	end
It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .	end
Yes .	end
Yes .	end
The effect was extremely good , ha .	end
So , how exactly did citizens react ?	end
Let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .	end
-- an SMS .	end
I saw it was that Jingguang Bridge .	that Jingguang Bridge ! fact ;
Hey , I say , this is quite good , quite good .	end
Have you received information like this before ?	end
No , no .	end
This was the first time .	first ! order ;
The first time ?	first ! order ;
Yes , yes .	end
Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?	end
Quite fast .	end
Really quite fast , ah .	end
So , I did not drive today .	today ! date ;
I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .	end
Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?	end
Ah , the response was quite fast .	end
In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .	end
Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .	end
I think this plan was quite speedy .	end
It seems that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .	end
Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .	end
Let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .	end
Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .	end
Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road .	the Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .	end
See , through this footage , we see , ah , this --	end
Uh-huh .	end
Okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock .	4 o'clock ! time ;
That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .	end
Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .	end
Well , ah , Yang Yang , you work at Traffic Radio Station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .	Yang Yang ! person ; Traffic Radio Station ! org ;
A special program .	end
Yes , a special program on this traffic .	end
So , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .	first ! order ;
Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?	end
Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing .	Beijing ! country ;
Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing .	Beijing ! country ;
That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .	the Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; the Third Ring Road ! fact ; Third Ring Road ! fact ;
Uh-huh .	end
It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .	Second Ring Road ! fact ; Fourth Ring Road ! fact ;
Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .	about half an hour to an hour ! time ;
Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; Changhong Bridge ! fact ; Guomao Bridge ! fact ;
Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .	first ! order ;
Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .	6:30 a .m . today ! time ;
However , actually after the entire day today , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .	the entire day today ! date ; Beijing today ! country ;
Uh-huh .	end
However , the affected area was not as large as expected .	end
Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .	end
Right .	end
Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .	end
Because I know this situation .	end
Right , like those whom we interviewed just now .	end
It was easy to handle once everyone understood .	end
Yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , I set out today before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed .	today ! date ;
That person did not even drive .	end
Right .	end
Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .	end
For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS .	end
A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .	12th ! order ; the China World Trade Center ! fact ; the Guomao Bridge ! fact ;
We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .	end
Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center .	the China World Trade Center ! fact ;
Right .	end
Hey , he said this was quite a good idea .	end
Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .	end
Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .	Beijing ! country ;
Ah , we can take a look later through an animation .	end
This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .	Chaoyang Road ! fact ;
Uh-huh .	end
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .	Chaoyang Road ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .	Chaoyang Road ! fact ;
Yes .	end
When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .	end
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .	end
Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ;
Yes .	end
As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .	the Third Ring Road ! fact ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; 32 ! num ;
Uh-huh .	end
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .	one ! num ; 32 ! num ;
If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --	end
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .	end
Right .	end
Have not seen so many buses .	end
Right .	end
Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .	end
Yes .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?	end
Our correspondent specially interviewed Director Meng Xianlong , Mr. Meng Xianlong , of the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration .	Meng Xianlong ! person ; Meng Xianlong ! person ; the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration ! org ;
Let 's hear what Director Meng said .	Meng ! person ;
Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .	end
In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .	first ! order ;
In this way , all vehicles going along East Third Ring Road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
East Third Ring Road is a traffic artery in the east of Beijing that links the north and the south .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Beijing ! country ;
In order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .	end
We set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along East Second Ring Road , East Fourth Ring Road , West Dawang Road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .	68 ! num ; East Second Ring Road ! fact ; East Fourth Ring Road ! fact ; West Dawang Road ! fact ; 210 ! num ;
It can be said that measures were very promptly taken .	end
Ah , today is the first workday after the New Year holiday .	today ! date ; first ! order ; New Year ! thing ;
Well , what exactly was the situation this morning ?	end
We specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .	this morning ! num ;
Let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .	end
Well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at East Third Ring Road , ah , near Guanghua Bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of Jingguang Bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Guanghua Bridge ! fact ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ;
Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .	Beijing ! country ; minus 3 degrees ! measure ;
Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .	end
Ah , it can be said , ah , Yang Yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .	Yang Yang ! person ;
Uh-huh .	end
Right , right .	end
, through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?	end
Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .	end
Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; CBD ! country ; early in the morning ! time ;
Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .	today ! date ;
Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .	end
We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .	end
This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .	end
I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .	one ! num ; Beijing ! country ;
On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .	end
That is , they think that the government has tried its best .	end
Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .	end
Uh-huh .	end
As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Well , Professor Zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?	Zhou ! person ; one ! num ;
Yes .	end
In terms of citizens ' mentality .	end
Yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .	end
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .	end
We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .	end
Time was lost .	end
Well , yes , the State Council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .	the State Council ! org ;
That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .	first ! order ;
In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .	end
That is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .	end
I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .	end
Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .	end
Traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred .	first ! order ;
However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .	end
Yes .	end
Yang Yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?	Yang Yang ! person ;
Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground .	end
They include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .	end
Truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .	end
Closely linked .	end
Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .	end
Let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .	end
Ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission , ah , the Communication Commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work .	the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission ! org ; the Communication Commission ! org ;
Relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period .	end
Well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .	end
Well , ah , Professor Zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?	Zhou ! person ;
Yes .	end
This is also --	end
It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .	end
Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .	end
How many groups of people will be sent ?	end
Many groups .	end
Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .	end
It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .	end
Uh-huh .	end
How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?	end
Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .	end
For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .	end
However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .	Beijing Municipality ! country ; Beijing Municipality ! country ;
Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .	end
Uh-huh .	end
It was a very successful , er , response .	end
I think many good things can be summed up from this .	end
Yes .	end
Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?	Yang Yang ! person ;
For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .	Beijing ! country ; last night ! time ; one ! num ;
Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .	end
Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .	about 70,000 square meters ! measure ; Beijing ! country ;
Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .	Chaoyang ! country ;
After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .	more than 200 ! num ;
It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .	yesterday ! date ;
Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .	end
Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .	end
I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .	Zhou ! person ; Beijing ! country ; more than 14 million ! num ;
Yes .	end
I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .	end
For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .	end
Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .	end
This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .	end
It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .	end
Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .	end
The critical thing is --	end
But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .	end
Yes .	end
Yes .	end
Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .	Beijing Municipality ! country ; recent years ! date ; a few years ago ! date ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Beijing Municipality 's ! country ;
Right .	end
It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .	end
Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .	Yang Yang ! person ;
Yes .	end
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .	end
It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .	Beijing Traffic Radio Station ! org ; Beijing ! country ;
Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .	Beijing Traffic Radio Station ! org ; three ! num ;
Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .	Zhou ! person ;
Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .	Beijing Municipality ! country ;
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .	Unblocked All the Way ! org ; that evening ! time ;
Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .	end
Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .	end
It was not clear , it was very congested .	end
You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .	end
You could find out other news only by telephone .	end
The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .	end
Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .	two years ago ! date ;
From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .	today ! date ;
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .	end
Yes .	end
It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .	end
Ah , apart from this , Professor Zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?	Zhou ! person ;
Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah .	end
First , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .	First ! order ;
This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .	end
Early warnings and forecasts .	end
Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .	end
Uh-huh .	end
It is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .	end
Uh-huh .	end
That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .	end
Uh-huh .	end
In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .	end
Uh-huh .	end
Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .	end
In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .	end
For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .	end
We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .	end
That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .	end
However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .	end
Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .	end
Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?	end
I think , in comparison to China , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .	China ! country ;
Their level of development is more advanced than ours .	end
Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .	1 % ! per ;
For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .	end
With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?	end
How can a safe , assured system be established ?	end
Well , we need to learn and manage this .	end
Uh-huh .	end
For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .	end
However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .	end
Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .	end
Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?	end
We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .	end
Well , how will they undergo testing ?	end
These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .	end
So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .	end
That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .	end
How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?	end
The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems .	The State Council ! org ; One ! num ; Three ! num ;
Uh-huh .	end
" One plan " refers to the contingency plan , and " three systems " refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .	One ! num ; three ! num ;
So , I think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .	three ! num ;
Yes .	end
Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in Beijing .	Beijing ! country ;
Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now .	end
Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .	end
Well , Yang Yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?	Yang Yang ! person ;
I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .	end
This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .	end
Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .	end
Uh-huh .	end
This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .	end
There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .	end
Yes , the pipes below .	end
Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --	end
Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .	end
Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .	end
But in the end , it requires time .	end
Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .	end
Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline .	end
The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .	end
Yes .	end
In addition , waste discharge is also very important .	end
Waste discharged has currently blocked this up .	end
Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .	end
Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .	end
Yes .	end
At present , we should not have a problem with watching television .	end
They are not broken .	end
It is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .	end
After that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section .	end
Furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .	end
Because they were exposed , The water pipes were not --	end
after that , yes , these were not damaged .	end
they were not damaged and this is quite normal .	end
Um , there is no problem with water supply .	end
Okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in Beijing Municipality .	today ! date ; Beijing Municipality ! country ;
At the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases .	end

The Chinese have influence certainly more than the United States and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem /.	Chinese ! national ; the United States ! country ;
China now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward , to send the North Koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the North Koreans now have to come back to the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they 've got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago /.	China ! country ; the North Koreans ! national ; the North Koreans ! national ; September nineteenth two thousand five ! date ; nearly a year ago ! date ;
But the South Koreans and the Chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against North Korea /.	the South Koreans ! national ; Chinese ! national ; North Korea ! country ;
Will the US absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the UN resolution /?	US ! country ; UN ! org ;
If you look at this UN resolution that 's under debate in New York it does /.	UN ! org ; New York ! country ;
it 's a chapter seven resolution so it has the effect of compulsory behavior by all the member states /.	chapter seven ! law ;
It says that what the North Koreans did was a threat to international peace and security /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
It does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
That strikes us as an obvious point /.	end
And I think what we have to do we 'll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /.	the next couple of days ! date ;
we 'll have to see how the Chinese and Russians react to this /.	Chinese ! national ; Russians ! national ;
but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of China and Russia 's of South Korea Japan and the United States to force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.	five ! num ; China ! country ; Russia ! country ; South Korea Japan ! country ; the United States ! country ; the North Koreans ! country ;
That 's certainly the best policy for the United States /.	the United States ! country ;
Force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
there are many as you know Mister Ambassador who believe the North Koreans did this launch on the fourth of July to get our attention Because they saw the way we were treating Iran differently than we were treating North Korea /.	the North Koreans ! national ; the fourth of July ! date ; Iran ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
Here 's one Nicholas Burns on National Public Radio /.	Nicholas Burns ! person ; National Public Radio ! org ;
With Iran the United States has made an offer /.	Iran the United States ! country ;
and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in Iran /.	Iranians ! national ; Iran ! country ;
Why not sit down in the same way with North Koreans Say to them stop developing your program /.	North Koreans ! national ;
and we 'll sit down with you one on one /.	one ! num ; one ! num ;
Well Tim we 're trying to sit down with the North Koreans in the context of the six party talks /.	Tim ! person ; the North Koreans ! national ; six ! num ;
We 've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for North Korea to return to these talks /.	months ! date ; North Korea ! country ;
but we really do n't see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the United States and North Korea /.	two ! num ; the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
The fact is that China has the same interest as the United States /.	China ! country ; the United States ! country ;
It should have the same interest /.	end
And that is to stop the North Korea nuclear program /.	North Korea ! country ;
Our allies Japan and South Korea have the same interests /.	Japan ! country ; South Korea ! country ;
and the Russians do as well /.	Russians ! national ;
And so we think we 're far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on North Korea of all these different countries /.	six ! num ; North Korea ! country ;
I simply do n't see why it 's in the interest of the United States to get those countries out of the way and only deal with North Korea directly /.	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the United States and North Korea /.	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
We 're perfectly willing to sit down with them in that six party environment /.	six ! num ;
and in that sense it 's analogous to what we 're trying to do with Iran /.	Iran ! country ;
Secretary Rice announced about a month ago that should the Iranians meet the condition of suspension of their own nuclear activities we 'd be willing to sit down in another multilateral forum /.	Rice ! person ; about a month ago ! date ; Iranians ! national ;
and that 's with the Europeans and Russians and Chinese /.	Europeans ! national ; Russians ! national ; Chinese ! national ;
So really you know the North Korea problem is not a problem just for the United States /.	North Korea ! country ; the United States ! country ;
What they did the other day on July fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the Asian countries /.	the other day ! date ; July fourth ! date ; Asian ! location ;
And the Asian countries want to be involved in these negotiations /.	Asian ! location ;
Is it the policy of the Bush administration that we 'd like to see regime change in North Korea /?	Bush ! person ; North Korea ! country ;
Well this is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /.	one ! num ;
it 's a major human rights violator /.	end
There 's massive famine /.	end
And certainly we hope for the day will come when those people will live in peace and be governed by a different type of government /.	end
Uh what we 've got to do now of course is focus on the most immediate problem /.	end
And that problem is nuclear weapons /.	end
The problem is the ballistic launches of the other day /.	the other day ! date ;
I think the thing to remember about those launches by the way they were provocative , they were reckless , they were also unsuccessful /.	end
They fired four scud missiles intermediate range missiles /.	four ! num ;
They tried to fire the longer range missile the /.	end
and that was spectacularly unsuccessful /.	end
It crashed in the sea of Japan /.	the sea of Japan ! location ;
So we obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . And an opportunity to use the combined strength of all these countries to provide some leverage put some leverage against the North Koreans /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
and that 's what we will continue to try to do in the coming days and coming weeks /.	coming days ! date ; coming weeks ! date ;
Will the United States give North Korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime /?	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
If you look back at this historic agreement that was signed in the six party frameworks on September nineteenth of two thousand five those types of assurances are in that agreement /.	six ! num ; September nineteenth of two thousand five ! date ;
But the North Koreans have obligations /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
and that is to take down their nuclear program dismantle it dismantle their weapons of mass destruction programs in a verifiable way before all those assurances can go into place /.	end
All the other elements of the agreement can be put into place /.	end
And what we 've seen since then is we 've seen the United States and Russia and China and Japan and South Korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to Tim /.	the United States ! country ; Russia ! country ; China ! country ; Japan ! country ; South Korea ! country ; Tim ! person ;
but we see the North Koreans walking away from it /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
So we 've got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with these other countries to pressure the North Koreans to live up to their commitments /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
But we would be willing to give North Korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated /?	North Korea ! country ;
The North Koreans know what 's in the September nineteenth agreement /.	The North Koreans ! national ; September nineteenth ! date ;
and it 's very specific about what the United States is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction /.	the United States ! country ;
But they 've got responsibilities in this agreement /.	end
and no agreement is whole until both sides meet their agreement /.	end
And what we 've seen Tim especially on July Fourth is the North Koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last September /.	July Fourth ! date ; the North Koreans ! national ; last September ! date ;
Why do you think the North Koreans chose July Fourth /?	the North Koreans ! national ; July Fourth ! date ;
Oh I do n't think it was coincidental /.	end
You know it 's a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /.	end
The last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make /.	end
but they certainly chose that to get our attention and that of the international community /.	end
Uh but what they 've got to realize is there is no magic bullet here /.	end
They ca n't just think that they can sit down with the United States alone /.	the United States ! country ;
That does n't work for Japan /.	Japan ! country ;
it does n't work with South Korea /.	South Korea ! country ;
and frankly it does n't work with the Chinese /.	Chinese ! national ;
So I said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this Chinese delegation going to /.	Chinese ! national ;
And Chris Hill our ambassador was in China a few days ago /.	Chris Hill ! person ; China a few days ago ! country ;
he made the point and Secretary Rice made the point yesterday to the Chinese Foreign minister , we want to see China use its influence /.	Rice ! person ; Chinese ! national ; China ! country ;
We want to see China push forward and ask the North Koreans to meet these commitments that they 've made to all of us /.	China ! country ; the North Koreans ! national ;
Speaker Newt Gingrich the former speaker Republican weighed in on this debate in this way /.	Newt Gingrich ! person ; Republican ! national ;
he offered this /.	end
The time to replace the state department 's failed North Korea strategy of talk forever , act never has come /.	North Korea ! country ;
For thirteen years the United States has talked loudly about a North Korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat /.	thirteen years the United States ! date ; North Korea ! country ;
For thirteen years the North Korean dictatorship has lied and hunkered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /.	thirteen years ! date ; North Korean ! national ;
The strategy of talking has failed /.	end
America 's actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little /.	America ! country ;
It is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments /.	end
But the time for talk is over /.	end
either they dismantle the missile /.	end
or we the United States should dismantle it /.	the United States ! country ;
Well uh with all due respect to Speaker Gingrich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success /.	Gingrich ! person ;
And you never want to disavow a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion /.	end
And as I said before we are not alone in this endeavor /.	end
we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure /.	end
I will say this what the North Koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system /.	the North Koreans ! national ; the past week ! date ;
You 've seen very strong statements by the Japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm /.	Japanese ! national ;
So obviously we 're going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the North Koreans on their obligations To pressure them to come back to the talks But also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in Asia /.	the coming weeks ! date ; the North Koreans ! national ; Asia ! location ;
And I think you 'll see us move ahead smartly in that direction as well /.	end
Uh Mister Ambassador many critics will say the six years George Bush has been president North Korea 's program has developed rather dramatically That the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n't worked /.	the six years George Bush ! date ; North Korea 's ! person ; first ! country ; six ! order ;
Here 's the latest study from the Institute for Science and International Security /.	the Institute for Science and International Security ! org ;
They estimated a report that North Korea has enough separated plutonium to develop now an arsenal of four to thirteen nuclear weapons compared with estimates of just one or two weapons in two thousand when George bush became president /.	North Korea ! country ; four to thirteen ! num ; just one or two ! num ; two thousand ! date ; George bush ! person ;
The group says that by two thousand eight North Korea could have enough plutonium for eight to seventeen nuclear weapons /.	two thousand eight North Korea ! date ; eight to seventeen ! country ;
The group 's assessment based on analysis of satellite imagery media reports and statements by North Korean officials which lead Nick Everstat a conservative critic from the American Enterprise Institute these are not Democrats /-	North Korean ! national ; Nick Everstat ! person ; the American Enterprise Institute ! org ; Democrats ! national ;
he offered this /.	end
although the Bush administration 's rhetoric about Kim Jong - Il and his regime has sometimes seemed ferocious North Korea 's leaders seem to have concluded that the Bush North Korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously /.	Bush ! person ; Kim Jong - Il ! person ; North Korea 's ! country ; Bush North Korea ! person ;
By more than one criteria indeed strategic successes on the Bush watch outshine those from its during the Clinton years /.	one ! num ; Bush ! person ; Clinton ! person ;
Would you acknowledge a significant increase in the nuclear capability by North Korea on the watch of President Bush /?	North Korea ! country ; Bush ! person ;
Tim um obviously we profoundly disagree with um some of the statements that we 've just heard /.	Tim ! person ;
Eh you know we 've got a very strong military force and deterrent force at work in Asia and particularly on the Korean peninsula /.	Asia ! location ; the Korean peninsula ! location ;
And that military can handle any contingency that should arise /.	end
We also have a very tough policy and I think forward looking policy to develop missile defense to handle those contingencies /.	end
But you 've got to combine military measures with diplomacy to be effective in a situation like this /.	end
The fact is that a lot of this criticism seems to direct the United States back to a test of wills bilaterally between North Korea and the United States /.	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ; the United States ! country ;
What we want to do is we want to ask countries that do have a great deal of influence on North Korea certainly more than we have to use that influence /.	North Korea ! country ;
We can do that by channeling those efforts through the six party framework /.	six ! num ;
And you know diplomacy sometimes ca n't succeed in a day or two or a week or two /.	a day or two ! date ; a week or two ! date ;
Sometimes it takes many months or even years to succeed /.	many months ! date ; years ! date ;
But if you have the right policy in place , if you know what you 're trying to accomplish and if you 're very tough - minded about applying that policy we can be successful /.	end
So we have not given up hope that we can engineer a policy that will effectively put the North Koreans back in the box take away their nuclear programs and take away their ability to inflict threats and damage on their neighbors /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
We have got to be single - minded about this /.	end
we certainly understand the gravity of a challenge posed by North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
but frankly I do n't think these critics have offered any alternative that would have a reasonable prospect of success or lead us to unintended consequences uh if you went down the road that some of them are suggesting /.	end
And we think we 've got the right policy in place /.	end
and I can assure you we 're going to drive with a great deal of energy and determination /.	end
But you do not deny that North Korea 's nuclear capability has increased during the presidency of George Bush /?	North Korea 's ! country ; George Bush ! person ;
Well North Korea says that it has a nuclear weapons capability /.	North Korea ! country ;
and we believe that it has produced that over the last several years /.	the last several years ! date ;
and that 's why we 've put in place this policy designed to take it away from them /.	end
And if we can have the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement implemented it will do just that /.	September nineteenth two thousand five ! date ;
It will effectively de-nuclearize North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
And so that is a good bet for the United States /.	the United States ! country ;
It 's obviously the goal that I think all these critics that you cite would share /.	end
But we think we 've got a much more realistic in the real world strategy put in place to deal with that problem /.	end
But there has been a profound change in the rhetoric certainly of the President on this subject /.	end
Here 's the President Friday at this news conference in Chicago about North Korea /.	Friday ! date ; Chicago ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
It takes a while for a problem to fester and grow /.	end
and then it takes a while to solve them diplomatically /.	end
It just 's the nature of diplomacy /.	end
Wish we could solve them overnight /.	overnight ! time ;
And let me go back to January of two thousand two in the President 's axis of evil speech before congress /.	January of two thousand two ! date ; congress ! org ;
Let 's watch /.	end
North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction While starving its citizens /.	North Korea ! country ;
States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world /.	end
By seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger /.	end
We 'll be deliberate /.	end
yet time is not on our side /.	end
I will not wait on events while dangers gather /.	end
I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer /.	end
The United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons /.	The United States of America ! country ;
Since the President uttered those words Mister Ambassador every estimate is that North Korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /.	North Korea ! country ;
And yet we 've driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the President talked about back in two thousand two /.	two thousand two ! date ;
But he has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /.	end
We have to try to draw a net around the fact that North Korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world The proliferator of it /.	North Korea ! country ;
we 've done a lot to develop missile defense /.	end
And we 've created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying North Korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about /.	North Korea ! country ;
So we have been very activist /.	end
We have followed this policy for a number of years /.	a number of years ! date ;
Uh the President is right /.	end
And as I said before diplomacy ca n't be measured in a snapshot /.	end
You ca n't just say in a Sunday morning in July that somehow because we have n't come to the end of negotiations these negotiations are bound to fail /.	a Sunday morning ! time ; July ! date ;
You 've got to be very purposeful and directed in what you 're trying to do and apply the weight of your country and that of others to the test /.	end
And that 's what we 're doing /.	end
We have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the North Koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the United States /.	the North Koreans ! national ; the United States ! country ;
But again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.	end
Let me go back and review some of the things the President has said about Kim Jong - Il of North Korea /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ; North Korea ! country ;
I loathe Kim Jong - Il /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
I got a visceral reaction to this guy /.	end
And then in two thousand four there 's a tyrant in North Korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /.	two thousand four ! date ; North Korea ! country ;
And then this in two thousand two /.	two thousand two ! date ;
the President called him a pygmy And compared him to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.	end
Does the President still believe that Kim Jong - Il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
Kim Jong - Il is a despot /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
And he is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /.	end
Uh these missile tests the other day were certainly reckless /.	the other day ! date ;
They were provocative /.	end
And so uh we have n't changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
No one in our government has /.	end
We are very clear - eyed about who they are , what they represent , how much they 've denied their own people the basic human rights that people should have around the world /.	end
And we 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.	end
So I think there 's been a lot of continuity over American policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we 've talked about North Korea over the last several years /.	American ! national ; North Korea ! country ; the last several years ! date ;
And uh we 're determined to press ahead /.	end
When the president talked about the axis of evil he said Iraq North Korea and Iran /.	Iraq North Korea ! country ; Iran ! country ;
The United States invaded one of those countries Iraq /.	The United States ! country ; one ! num ; Iraq ! country ;
Some now make the case that Iran and North Korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the US /.	Iran ! country ; North Korea ! country ; US ! country ;
And both of those countries have clearly miscalculated their own situation /.	end
Now the North Koreans felt I guess that by testing these ballistic missiles they would somehow put themselves in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
They 've miscalculated because you 've seen very tough statements from the Chinese and the Russians and the South Koreans and the Japanese against what they 've done /.	Chinese ! national ; Russians ! national ; the South Koreans ! national ; Japanese ! national ;
and you see momentum building in the UN security council toward a very tough chapter seven resolution against them /.	UN ! org ; chapter seven ! law ;
The Iranians have miscalculated /.	Iranians ! national ;
They thought that they could divide the United States from both our European allies and from Russia and China /.	the United States ! country ; European ! national ; Russia ! country ; China ! country ;
But we 've been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /.	end
And we 've essentially given the Iranians a clear choice /.	Iranians ! national ;
And you 'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in Europe when Secretary Rice meets with her counterparts on Wednesday at the GA summit in St. Petersburgh At the end of the week when the president is there /.	this week ! date ; Europe ! location ; Rice ! person ; Wednesday ! date ; St. Petersburgh ! country ; the end of the week ! date ;
the Iranians are going to have to choose /.	Iranians ! national ;
Negotiations with us after they suspend their nuclear programs or further action in the Security Council /.	the Security Council ! org ;
So I do n't think either of these countries is on the offensive /.	end
Frankly I think both of these countries are rather cornered and isolated /.	end
There are very few countries defending them /.	end
and they 're running out of options /.	end
So we think this policy of patient diplomacy and of crafting multilateral coalitions to tighten the pressure around them is going to work /.	end
And it 's the right way to go clearly for the United States /.	the United States ! country ;
we want to exhaust diplomatic means before we consider other means /.	end
Based on our experience in Iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize John Deutch the former head of the CIA offered this observation /.	Iraq ! country ; John Deutch ! person ; CIA ! org ;
the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example North Korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence /.	North Korea ! country ;
Do you agree with that /?	end
I do n't /.	end
not in the case of North Korea not in the case of Iran /.	North Korea ! country ; Iran ! country ;
Tim I 've been to Europe twenty times over the last fourteen months to talk to the Europeans and the Russians and Chinese about Iran for instance /.	Tim ! person ; Europe twenty ! location ; the last fourteen months ! num ; Europeans ! date ; Russians ! national ; Chinese ! national ; Iran ! national ;
There 's not a single person at the higher levels of those government who does n't believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons capability /.	Iran ! country ;
There is n't a single person in the governments of China or Russia or South Korea or Japan who does n't believe that North Korea is bent on building up its nuclear capability /.	China ! country ; Russia ! country ; South Korea ! country ; Japan ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
There is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries Iran and North Korea are trying to do /.	today ! date ; two ! num ; Iran ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
There is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our European allies over Iraq /.	two thousand and two and three ! date ; European ! national ; Iraq ! country ;
In fact we are now tightly knit up with these countries /.	end
And if you look at what the French German and British governments are saying as well as the Russian and Chinese governments about whether or not these countries are intending to create a nuclear weapons capability they agree with our assessment /.	French German ! national ; British ! national ; Russian ! national ; Chinese ! national ;
So I do n't agree at all that we 're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over WMD in Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
Let me conclude with comments by Bill Crystal the editor of Weekly Standard /.	Bill Crystal ! person ; Weekly Standard ! org ;

Iraq is n't getting better /.	Iraq ! country ;

I give the President a lot of credit for hanging tough on Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
but I am worried that it has made them too passive in confronting the other threats /.	end
Have a preoccupation with Iraq allowed North Korea and Iran to go forward with their nuclear programs and limited our options /?	Iraq ! country ; North Korea ! country ; Iran ! country ;
Well I strongly disagree with that criticism from Bill Crystal /.	Bill Crystal ! person ;

We have a very strong and active government /.	end

I do n't believe they do /.	end
They are a desolate isolated regime /.	end

But would n't the world then say oh I see /.	end
you test a missile on the fourth of July /.	the fourth of July ! date ;

And to make the form more important than a substance To care more about whether we have six parties meeting together than whether we stop the accumulation of plutonium is absurd in my view /.	six ! num ;
You 'd have some conditions /.	end
you had said prior to the missile test that if they took that missile off the launch pad you 'd negotiate face to face /.	end
Now that they 've launched it would you have any conditions before you went back to the table one on one /?	one ! num ; one ! num ;
This is kind of a rule I think that you really try hard not to negotiate with a gun or missile to your head /.	end
And I think a decent interval now and some work at the United Nations is the appropriate thing to do /.	the United Nations ! org ;
But I think we 're taking a view from thirty thousand feet right now /.	thirty thousand feet ! measure ;
what should the administration do /?	end
It needs to find a way to get back to the negotiating table /.	end
And the fact that you may get a headline like the President is reversing course as indeed we have in the case of Iran that 's not so bad if you find you 're on the wrong course /.	Iran ! country ;
and we have been /.	end
Ashton Carter do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between North Korea and the US /?	Ashton Carter ! person ; one ! num ; one ! num ; North Korea ! country ; US ! country ;
No I actually think the six party talks is a perfectly appropriate forum including for us to speak directly to the North Koreans if others are at the table /.	six ! num ; the North Koreans ! national ;
Let 's go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place /.	six ! num ; first ! order ;
The reason to have everybody at the table with the North Koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with North Korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension /.	the North Koreans ! national ; North Korea ! country ;
And we do n't trade with North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
we do n't recognize North Korea diplomatically /.	North Korea ! country ;
uh there 's almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
We 're capable of military action /.	end
and it 's important that that be an ingredient of course in diplomacy /.	end
But the real levers on Kim Jong - Il are the Chinese and the South Koreans /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ; Chinese ! national ; the South Koreans ! national ;
It is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically /.	end
But makes sense to have them at the table /.	end
The six party talks I totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quadrupling of the amount of plutonium as ambassador Richardson said um in North Korean hands and now missile launches /.	six ! num ; Richardson ! person ; North Korean ! national ;
So they 've been running wild for three years or so /.	three years or so ! date ;
Um the reason for that /-	end
there 's a lot of blame to go around /.	end
you have to start with the North Koreans and their own intransigence /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
The Chinese and the South Koreans have not done everything that they should /.	Chinese ! national ; the South Koreans ! national ;
uh they 've shown the carrots /.	end
they 've been unwilling to show the sticks that they can also wield /.	end
I think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the North Koreans /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
And our government I believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps /.	the last few years ! date ; six ! num ; two ! num ;
One camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with North Korea /.	One ! num ; North Korea ! country ;
But there 's another camp uh in this country and I think represented in the government that believes that negotiating with the North Koreans is a fools game or is even immoral because of the nature of the regime /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
I do n't agree with that view because I think it 's more immoral to let North Korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
But we have been of two minds /.	two ! num ;
and therefore I do n't think we at the table has been as effective as we might have been /.	end
you showed some of that ambivalence in the earlier part of your segment where you see the US government saying one thing at one time and another thing at the other times /.	US ! country ; one ! num ; one ! num ;
Though it 's important that we get our story straight /.	end
and that 's more important than who else is at the table /.	end
You had advocated several weeks ago a preemptive military strike on the missile that was about to be tested /.	several weeks ago ! date ;
Many criticize that as belligerent /.	end
and perhaps could even trigger a North Korea response against South Korea or against Japan /.	North Korea ! country ; South Korea ! country ; Japan ! country ;
who knows /.	end
In hindsight do you still stand by that preemptive military strike /?	end
Well I do /.	end
and I want to put that in some context /.	end
By the way I would say we should have that same position today That is if the North Koreans go out to the launch pad and erect that missile and prepare to launch it we can destroy that uh before they can do it /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
To do so would be a very limited military action a single bomb a single cruise missile /.	end
the north Koreans are n't going to start a war in response uh to that kind of action /.	the north Koreans ! national ;
And to those that think that 's too much I can only say where are you going to draw a line in the sand with North Korea /?	North Korea ! country ;
At some point we have to draw a line in the sand and defend it /.	end
We say things are intolerable /.	end
we say they 're unacceptable /.	end
and then we tolerate and accept /.	end
former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and I thought long and hard about this /.	Defense Bill Perry ! org ;
and we thought that this was a relatively nonprovocative way to draw a line in the sand with North Koreans /.	North Koreans ! national ;
Now I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction also /.	end
you may say there 's risk in this action /.	end
but I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction as well letting North Korea go nuclear /.	North Korea ! country ;
Governor Richardson well how do you think the North Koreans would react if we took out their test missile /?	Richardson ! person ; the North Koreans ! national ;
Well I respectfully disagree with Assistant Secretary Carter there /.	Carter ! person ;
But at least he 's got a new idea which the administration does not put forth /.	end
I think if we are seriously attacked or threatened , that missile which was a test was geared to the United States or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with South Korea or Japan /. /.	the United States ! country ; South Korea ! country ; Japan ! country ;
Uh you do take that step /.	end
but the fact is that you risk uh the uh North Koreans shooting missiles at South Korea /.	North Koreans ! national ; South Korea ! country ;
and we 've got thirty seven thousand American forces at the DMZ /.	thirty seven thousand American ! num ;
Uh but Tim I think another reason for the face to face talks is that there 're two issues that are separate from the six party talks that are a serious grievance in our relationship /.	Tim ! person ; two ! num ; six ! num ;
one is the fact that we have frozen financial assets of the North Koreans /.	one ! num ; the North Koreans ! national ;
I believe rightly so /.	end
but that is a separate bilateral issue /.	end
The second is our objection to dealing with North Koreans ' request for a light water reactor Which I believe has bogged down the six party talks /.	second ! order ; North Koreans ' ! national ; six ! num ;
Which by the way I believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the United States and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the South Koreans and the Japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives /.	the United States ! country ; six ! num ; the South Koreans ! national ; Japanese ! national ;
So you ca n't cut them out /.	end
but I think it 's essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between United States and North Korea /.	United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
But in the end it 's a judgment of North Korean intentions /.	North Korean ! national ;
You 'd been there five times /.	five ! num ;
you know them /.	end
and yet a few weeks before the missile launch you said I do n't think they 're going to test /.	a few weeks ! date ;
And they did /.	end
No Tim I said I believe that they were going to test /.	Tim ! person ;
I did say that /.	end
And what I sense in my negotiations in dealing with North Koreans /-	North Koreans ! national ;
You said as days go by I do n't believe they 're going to do it /.	days ! date ;
But early on I said that they did on CBS /.	CBS ! org ;
Uh my point is that when you deal with North Korea you 're not dealing with individuals like you and me /.	North Korea ! country ;
Do n't believe in compromise /.	end
they believe in their only way or the highway /.	end
Their view is that their cause is right /.	end
and they 're going to wait you out /.	end
So they 're totally unpredictable /.	end
and I believe the only way to deal with them and we have shown that effectively in past dealings with the Clinton Administration is direct engagement To get them to curb their nuclear weapons as Bob Gallucci did /.	Clinton ! person ; Bob Gallucci ! person ;
Secretary Albright almost got a missile agreement /.	Albright ! person ;
Uh Jimmy Carter got uh an agreement which was later violated regrettably with the father Kim Jong - Il /.	Jimmy Carter ! person ; Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
My point is that face to face discussions with the United States directly I believe is a precursor /.	the United States ! country ;
the continuation of the six party talks is the best way to go /.	six ! num ;
But do they keep their word /?	end
Here 's Madeline Albright toasting Kim Jong - Il in North Korea October of two thousand /.	Madeline Albright ! person ; Kim Jong - Il ! person ; North Korea October of two thousand ! country ;
She appeared on this program four years later /.	four years later ! date ;
and this was our exchange /.	end
But did n't North Korea develop a nuclear bomb on Bill Clinton 's watch /?	North Korea ! country ; Bill Clinton 's ! person ;
No what they were doing uh as it turns out , they were cheating /.	end
and the reason that you have arms control agreements is that you do n't make them with your friends , you make them with your enemies /.	end
and it is the process that is required to hold uh countries accountable /.	end
Ambassador Gallucci you negotiated that ninety four agreement /.	Gallucci ! person ; ninety four ! date ;
The North Koreans stopped processing in one plant if you will /.	The North Koreans ! national ; one ! num ;
but we later found out that at the same time they were making uranium in another plant /.	end
Not actually /.	end
No that 's not what we found out /.	end
What happened was we did do a deal /.	end
We did stop a uh plutonium based pro-nuclear weapons program /.	end
We made sure that eight thousand fuel rods containing around thirty kilograms enough for five nuclear weapons worth of plutonium stayed in a storage pond /.	eight thousand ! num ; around thirty kilograms ! measure ; five ! num ;
And the deal would have had the North Koreans end their nuclear weapons program /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
We think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from Pakistan /.	the late nineties ! date ; Pakistan ! country ;
We do n't know a lot about that where it is whether the equipment has been put together /.	end
We think over a period of time they 'll do what the Pakistanis did , what the Iranians appear to be wanting to do and put together this gas centrifuge /.	Pakistanis ! national ; Iranians ! national ;
But they never got there yet /.	end
Or we do n't think they 've gotten there yet /.	end
But they broke their word /.	end
They absolutely cheated /.	end
There 's no question about that /.	end
But really you ought to be clear here what 's happened /.	end
There was a nuclear weapons program that was stopped /.	end
Plutonium production was stopped /.	end
Right /.	end
And afterwards tragically I believe that agreement which locked them up was allowed to collapse /.	end
And we find ourselves now with the North Koreans accumulating plutonium a bomb 's worth a year /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
And freed up that plutonium that was um controlled for that period of time /.	end
And they say they 've used it to make bombs /.	end
we 'd have to estimate about five more /.	five ! num ;
And with each passing day I would argue to you more important than that missile that Ash would take out on the gantry if it turns up again with each passing day we 're going to find ourselves more and more closer than we were before to the day where that material could be transferred or sold to Al - Queda Presenting a threat far greater than the threat that is posed to us by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /.	each passing day ! date ; Ash ! person ; the day ! date ;
We can deter a country with ballistic missiles /.	end
We know the return address /.	end
We do /.	end
But with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against United Airlines or American Airlines Or a bus or a truck /.	United Airlines ! org ; American Airlines ! org ;
And deterrents does n't work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than his life /.	end
So no defense no deterrents /.	end
we need to lock up the nuclear program /.	end
You would not care about the ballistic missile program if they did not have the nuclear weapons program /.	end
But you can have all the agreements you want /.	end
if they 're going to cheat what good are they /?	end
Madeline Albright essentially had it correct in my view /.	Madeline Albright ! person ;
You make a deal /.	end
Nobody did that deal in ninety four thinking we were trusting North Koreans /.	ninety four ! date ; North Koreans ! national ;
We had some transparency a measure of it /.	end
and you verify /.	end
We caught them cheating /.	end
You might make another deal /.	end
I think you should /.	end
You ask the question you make another deal are you better off with the deal /.	end
or are you better off without it /?	end
If the answer to the former is yes you do the deal /.	end
You do n't +ask I think the simple question have they fooled us before /.	end
then do n't let them fool us again /.	end
I do n't believe that 's the way you proceed in international affairs /.	end
It asks a very tough question about the national security /.	end
should we do this /?	end
Is it better for us /?	end
Ask for more transparency /.	end
Insist on it /.	end
Be tough in the negotiations Not in the formality of whether it 's six parties or it 's bilateral /.	six ! num ;
Let me show you all two presidents Bill Clinton back in nineteen ninety three George Bush ten years later talking to the North Koreans in effect /.	two ! num ; Bill Clinton ! person ; nineteen ninety three George Bush ten years later ! date ; the North Koreans ! person ;
And I 'm asking you to put your mind in place of a North Korean watching this /.	a North Korean ! national ;
President Clinton President Bush /.	Clinton ! person ; Bush ! person ;
North Korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb /.	North Korea ! country ;
We had to be very firm about it /.	end
We will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
Ash Carter both presidents making very firm resolved statements /.	Ash Carter ! person ;
if you 're in North Korean watching that knowing that you now have the potential of building eight nuclear bombs what are you thinking /?	North Korean ! national ; eight ! num ;
Well I 'm concerned that they 're thinking that we 're giving a new meaning to the word intolerable Because they keep doing things that we say are intolerable and then we tolerate them /.	end
That 's why I think at some point you have to draw the line with the North Koreans /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
I do think and here I agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it 's possible to reach an agreement with North Korea and to get agreements that serve our interests The much maligned agreed framework as Bob Galluci pointed out without that agreed framework North Korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /.	North Korea ! country ; Bob Galluci ! person ; North Korea ! country ; fifty ! num ;
So we were better off with the agreement than without it /.	end
It is possible to reach agreement with the North Koreans But not when they see the kind of footage that you uh showed Which is uh uh uh Americans drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back from that line And drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back /.	the North Koreans ! national ; Americans ! national ;
I think our diplomacy has to have carrots in it but it has to stand somewhere /.	end
and as I suggested earlier I think the missile tests are a good place to take a stand /.	end
Governor Richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /.	Richardson ! person ;
the North Koreans watch that /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
they observe that /.	end
they know what their own has been /.	end
How do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /?	end
The North Koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /.	The North Koreans ! national ;
In your earlier segment you showed president Bush calling him a tyrant /.	Bush ! person ;
But then later he called him Mister Kim Jong - Il /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
I was in North Korea when that happened /.	North Korea ! country ;
The North Koreans were delighted because they felt they 'd been treated with respect /.	The North Koreans ! national ;
They care deeply about protocol /.	end
And this is another reason why I think for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of Chris Hill who again is very competent I believe would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks Which is essential Which is basically a good agreement /.	Chris Hill ! person ; six ! num ;
In exchange for North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked /.	North Korea ! country ;
they get food fuel energy assistance /.	end
Security assurances we will not topple their regime /.	end
That 's right /.	end
yeah that 's right /.	end
that 's in that September agreement that Chris Hill negotiated /.	September ! date ; Chris Hill ! person ;
My point is if it 's just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the North Korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of Kim Jong - Il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we 've promised it to Iran and economic incentives to Iran I think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation /.	North Korean ! national ; Kim Jong - Il ! person ; Iran ! country ; Iran ! country ;
Ambassador Galluci based on your experience do you believe the North Koreans would give up their nuclear program give up their nuclear bombs which they believe in their mind is an insurance policy against an American invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /?	Galluci ! person ; the North Koreans ! national ; American ! national ;
At the end of the day I do n't know /.	end
Um but that leaves me to conclude since I really do n't know that it 's a good idea to find out /.	end
It 's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the North that required them to give up the program /.	nineteen ninety four ! date ; the North ! country ;
We did that /.	end
and for a period of years we were in a position to monitor that closely /.	a period of years ! date ;
and they did give it up /.	end
Indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the Pakistanis is clearly cheating was n't yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n't produced anything and probably still has n't produced anything /.	Pakistanis ! national ;
So you have the possibility if the North Koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other , they need either nuclear weapons to deter the United States from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons /.	the North Koreans ! national ; one ! num ; the United States ! country ;
The only way to find out whether they 'll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /.	end
We hear so much talk about Kim Jong - Il tyrant spoiled child /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
others have said madman /.	end
you 've been in that country five times /.	five ! num ;
who is he /?	end
What is he /?	end
Well I 've never met him /.	end

He is the entire nation /.	end
he is basically a cult of personality /.	end
He runs everything /.	end

His people are in terrible shape economically /.	end

I think I 've seen one tractor /.	one ! num ;
I see people weak and drawn out /.	end
they look like they need nourishment /.	end
A lot of people are starving there /.	end
They have human rights violations /.	end
He is a mercurial character /.	end
But I think he 's crazy like a fox /.	end
He is not somebody that is uh out of his mind /.	end
he may be totally unpredictable isolated /.	end
but he 's calculating /.	end
and he 's used the Fourth of July /.	the Fourth of July ! date ;
every time he feels he 's backed down he moves and does something irrational /.	end
Uh he shoots missiles off /.	end
he 's done it twice /.	end
He cancels agreements /.	end
he gets the nuclear inspectors out in two thousand and two /.	two thousand and two ! date ;
This is the way he operates /.	end
And what we should do is take advantage of his vulnerability /.	end
He also is vulnerable in the sense that the country is weak economically /.	end
it desperately needs an elimination of sanctions /.	end
they need food electricity /.	end
He 's realistic too I believe /.	end

Children are left at home in the rural areas , after parents leave to work in the city .	end
These are called left - behind children .	end
The parents are also forced to work in the city .	end
In fact , they have no alternatives but to make such a decision .	end
There are 120 million farmers who work in the city all year round in China , thus creating nearly 20 million left - behind children .	120 million ! num ; China ! country ; 20 million ! num ;
I want to tell them that I miss them a lot .	end
Day after day and year after year , they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect .	end
I think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children .	end
Visit the children more often whenever possible .	end
-LSB- -RSB-	end
In September 2005 , a study report titled " Concern for Left - behind Children " had drawn wide public attention .	September 2005 ! date ; " Concern for Left - behind Children " ! art ;
While the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .	end
Ye Jingzhong is the assistant dean of the College of Humanities and Development at China Agricultural University , and team leader of the Left - behind Children Task Force .	Ye Jingzhong ! person ; the College of Humanities and Development ! org ; China Agricultural University ! org ; the Left - behind Children Task Force ! org ;
In the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western China , including Shaanxi , Ningxia , Hebei , and Beijing .	the last two years ! date ; China ! country ; Shaanxi ! country ; Ningxia ! country ; Hebei ! country ; Beijing ! country ;
Why did you pick the central and western parts of China , and not the south , to conduct this study ?	China ! country ;
First of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work .	First ! order ;
They are not in a position to bring their children to the city .	end
When we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents , work in the city .	end
, its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .	end
Therefore , we believe that whether it 's in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent .	end
According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ?	China ! country ;
This group should be the biggest in number .	end
Um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .	100 million ! num ;
Nowadays , um , , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .	120 million ! num ;
Many people quote a figure of 150 million .	150 million ! num ;
Let 's think about it this way .	end
If we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city .	120 million ! num ; half ! num ;
Of course , families of these married people will usually have children .	end
Moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .	more than one ! num ;
So you can imagine .	end
I believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million .	more than 10 or 20 million ! num ;
It , uh , , in my opinion , should be around 50 million .	50 million ! num ;
Of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations .	end
I believe the number of this group should be particularly large .	end
According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . Among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .	four ! num ; 79.2 percent ! per ;
The next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent . While those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children , respectively .	one ! num ; 16.9 percent ! per ; 4.1 percent ! per ; .9 percent ! per ;
According to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ?	end
Different types of custody have different impacts on their life .	end
No doubt , , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .	end
The impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .	end
There is no major problem in the children 's material life .	end
Of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization .	end
The one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .	one ! num ;
Skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .	end
There is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .	end
These three types create the biggest and the most impact .	three ! num ;
If we want to discuss this in more detail , let 's say , the skip - generation custody .	end
First , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation .	First ! order ;
This is indisputable .	end
This type of family is not as good as the others .	end
We had an example of a child in Shaanxi province .	Shaanxi province ! country ;
Um , there was a family !	end
This family had an older brother and a younger sister .	end
Both parents wanted to go to the city to work .	end
The father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too .	first ! order ;
What happened to these two children ?	two ! num ;
The grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !	end
As a result , , this mother sent , these brother and sister , to martial arts school to study .	end
After they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .	end
She went to visit them .	end
When she saw them , , the girl cried to her and said , " I really do n't want to stay here .	end
I want to go home . "	end
Later , the mother was moved and brought , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .	end
Um , she still , ai , left him at the martial arts school .	end
Um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .	end
When she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl 's body was dotted with red marks and red swellings .	one ! num ;
She then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time .	end
The situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?	end
The situation that I just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common .	end
Why is it so ?	end
You said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .	end
It is true .	end
It is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .	end
However , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different .	end
They are influenced by their own habits .	end
For instance , there was a child who was sick .	end
Um , the grandparents asked him to take , a small pill that was made in Shaanxi .	Shaanxi ! country ;
They did not even know what it was made of .	end
It was a local method .	end
Um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect .	end
Instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by , some habits in this aspect .	end
, they raised this point themselves .	end
Another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .	end
" Her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .	end
So , all I can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold . "	end
They also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .	end
After all , a family that had so many people in the beginning , , the parents of the children were a very important um , workforce .	end
Now it was down to the two grandparents .	two ! num ;
No doubt , they could not help .	end
In the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet .	two ! num ;
Farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school .	end
Originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education .	end
However , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more .	end
During this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children .	end
This pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious .	end
You have seen many kinds of left - behind children .	end
Was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?	end
, um , there was a child in Ningxia whose name was Yao Zhengang .	Ningxia ! country ; Yao Zhengang ! person ;
This child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school .	end
What impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents .	end
He felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back .	end
He said that he was sick one time .	one ! num ;
His father worked in Guyuan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home .	Guyuan ! country ; 40 to 50 kilometers ! measure ;
After his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away .	end
After he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor .	end
He just carried him like that without saying a word .	end
When the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county .	end
When Yao Zhengang told us what happened , he said , " My father had never bought me so many tasty foods before .	Yao Zhengang ! person ;
On that day , he bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself . "	that day ! date ;
I thought about this at that time .	end
After I heard this incident , I particularly understood what was in the mind of Yao Zhengang 's father .	Yao Zhengang 's ! person ;
He might have felt especially guilty toward his child .	end
What he felt was that " I go out to work and leave my child home . "	end
He said that his child had also said , " When he was at home , he always encouraged me . "	end
He would say , " No problem . You work hard and get a better grade next time , " when I had low grades .	end
If he could receive many , such encouragements , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes .	end
He does not want to go to school now .	end
However , in his example , I could imagine what went through his father 's mind at that time .	end
I think that he felt very guilty toward his child .	end
Therefore , I can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative .	end
They are forced into making such decisions .	end
Um , there was also this child .	end
There was a child , a girl in Xixiang county , Shaanxi province .	Xixiang county ! country ; Shaanxi province ! country ;
Um , when I asked , " What do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? " She did not answer .	end
She went home to get a small box .	end
There was a small finger inside the box .	end
This was a very terrifying incident .	end
What was the small finger all about ?	end
What happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her .	end
They had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .	end
When she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened .	end
Her grandparents said , " We ca n't help .	end
We ca n't keep an eye on her all the time . "	end
, before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar .	end
He had told her not to do that before .	end
However , I said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control .	end
That was why she turned this way .	end

It was taken with his father six years ago , before he sent him to live with his maternal grandfather .	six years ago ! date ;
He was only eight years old at that time .	eight years ! date ;
The only connection that little Beiwen has with his parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week .	Beiwen ! person ;
In his opinion , affection among family members is something unreachable .	end
How often can your mother call you ?	end
Uh , once a week !	end
What do you talk about ?	end
I will talk about my studies and life .	end
My schoolwork was not quite good when I first came !	first ! order ;
My mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor .	end
She said that I was losing honor for not doing well at school !	end
Then I cried and after that , my mother cried , too .	end
Since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .	end
While for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .	end
The survey found that 36.7 percent of the children had never been to their parents ' workplace .	36.7 percent ! per ;
8.2 percent of the parents almost never contacted their children .	8.2 percent ! per ;
21.4 percent of the parents contacted their children less than once a month .	21.4 percent ! per ;
Since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?	end
Our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .	end
However , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .	approximately 50 percent ! per ; three minutes ! time ;
What could they talk about in three minutes ?	three minutes ! time ;
I think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes .	three minutes ! time ;
Of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations .	three - minute ! time ;
What did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?	end
What touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children 's conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned .	70 percent ! per ;
As for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school .	first ! order ;
Whether they were good and how their schoolwork was .	end
Second , it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that .	Second ! order ;
Uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange .	end
We know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange .	end
However , the parents may not have realized this .	end
For instance , the child has stopped talking .	end
He stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .	end
The parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately .	end
Of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ?	three minutes ! time ; three minutes ! time ;
In many cases , it was because they worried about the charge .	end
, many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone .	end
However , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home .	one ! num ;
It was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors .	end
Second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call .	Second ! order ;
Some children told me , " I secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home . "	end
The children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange .	end
Do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?	end
Um , um , we conducted a survey on this question .	end
We were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home .	40 percent ! per ;
How could that be possible ?	end
How could that be possible ?	end
We interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city .	end
Why would n't the children know what they did ?	end
First , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city .	First ! order ; three - minute ! time ;
However , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .	end
Thus , I believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job .	end
Why do they do that ?	end
It is because they are afraid that their children will worry .	end
Second , , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children 's mind .	Second ! order ;
Maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do .	end
They , do not want to destroy the lofty image of themselves in the child 's mind .	end
At noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home .	noon ! time ;

What work are you going to do today , other than cooking ?	today ! date ;
Uh , I will do the dishes after I finish eating .	end
If it is Sunday when I am free , I will , also do some farm work .	Sunday ! date ;
What kind of work ?	end
Uh , I will hoe the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , I will help do some work .	end
Do you still remember your mother 's cooking ?	end
Uh huh , I do .	end
It was especially tasty .	end
Now , the most I want to know is , my parents ' health .	end
Why do you want to know about that ?	end
It is because I care about my parents very much .	end
I think about their work because I know that they work in the city because of me , so I care about them a lot .	end
They will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money .	end
I believe it is also because of me , so I care about their health a lot .	end
Because of you , why is it because of you ?	end
Because if they did n't have me , I think they uh , would be a lot more , relaxed when they worked .	end
Then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? Or go to the city with them ?	end
In regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .	first ! order ;
However , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .	51 percent ! per ;
However , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .	half ! num ;
We also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .	end
This was also very surprising to us .	end
They said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .	end
They were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that .	end
Second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city .	Second ! order ;
Their parents have to send money home , among other things .	end
If they go live with them , they will add more burdens to their parents .	end
If we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this .	end
As for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear .	end
As for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?	end
I believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling .	end
All parents , I can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children .	end
However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem .	end
Of course , we know what the reality is .	end
First , their families are rather poor to begin with .	First ! order ;
Only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city .	end
They have to make money to support the family .	end
They will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .	end
Nonetheless , I believe there are also many other reasons .	end
They also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .	end
They have to find a place to live .	end
All these are problems that they need to resolve .	end
The problems they face are too many .	end
If the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high .	end
Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need .	end
Many parents are unable to bring their children with them .	end
What would you tell your parents if you could see them now ?	end
I want to tell them that I miss them very much .	end
Judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ?	end
It is hard to tell from the surface .	end
Why is it so ?	end
For these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city .	end
For example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already .	a year ! date ; 10 years ! date ;
In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .	end
However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .	end
They had very strange um , um , temperaments .	end
They did not like to speak .	end
There was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school .	the first year ! date ;
Um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father .	end
He was very good at school .	end
However , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination .	second ! order ;
After that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed .	end
Um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange .	end
Um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him .	end
They said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him .	end
Um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .	end
However , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development .	end
This situation indeed exists .	end
After all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete .	end
I believe love is especially important .	end
Children need love from the time they are small .	end
We have to understand our Chinese saying , " The child is father to the man . "	Chinese ! national ;
What it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life .	end
Only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future .	end
This is the case .	end
Therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .	end
Um , , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home .	end
Perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love .	end
Under this situation , I believe , I am not sure , um , I am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up .	end
Will they believe there is love in society or not ?	end
Will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it .	end
They have never completely experienced it .	end
Thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , I think this is , something that I do not want to imagine .	end
Despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require .	end
According to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life .	more than half ! num ;
58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy .	58 percent ! per ;
Are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ?	end
Do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ?	end
They thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face .	end
They were condemned to this reality .	end
No doubt , I think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration .	end
Why do n't they ?	end
I believe people are all the same .	end
If they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood .	first ! order ;
They can not consider the deeper issue of children 's safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed .	end
For example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in Shaanxi province .	two ! num ; Shaanxi province ! country ;
Many people whom we interviewed lived in cave dwellings .	end
Once there was a flood .	end
, these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home !	end
This happened in the rural area .	end
These two children were looking after the home .	two ! num ;
Their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies .	end
Their father called later to see if they were fine .	end
The family told him that they were fine .	end
He did not come back after that .	end
He did not come back to check if everything was fine .	end
I believe the reason he did not return was that he would ponder whether he should return or not .	end

And to say that she does not recall is really as convincing as having Woodward and Bernstein saying that they do not recall who Deep Throat was /.	Woodward ! person ; Bernstein ! person ; Deep Throat ! person ;
After all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the Valerie Plame Bob Novak column appeared and when the whole Washington and the whole journalistic community was talking about it /.	just a few weeks old ! date ; Valerie Plame Bob Novak ! person ; Washington ! person ;
You know I do n't /-	end
Incidentally there was some questions uh that Judy Miller would not answer to her colleagues /.	Judy Miller ! person ;
and she would n't share her notes with them although they 've been turned over to the special prosecutor /.	end
Lucy Dalglish the big news for me was Miller recounting what her lawyer Floyd Abrams had said to her about a conversation that he had with Joe Tate who was Scooter Libby 's lawyer /.	Lucy Dalglish ! person ; Miller ! person ; Floyd Abrams ! person ; Joe Tate ! person ; Scooter Libby 's ! person ;
Uh says um Floyd Abrams according to Miller 's account when I would n't give him Tate an assurance that you would exonerate Libby he said do n't go there /.	Floyd Abrams ! person ; Miller ! person ; Tate ! person ; Libby ! person ;
Now Tate by the way tells the Times that that account is false and outrageous /.	Tate ! person ; Times ! org ;
Does this help justify eh Judy Miller 's otherwise mysterious decision to go to jail and not accept the waiver of confidentiality that Scooter Libby offered and sit in jail for eighty - five days /?	Judy Miller 's ! person ; Scooter Libby ! person ; eighty - five days ! date ;
N- you n- /.	end
you know I 've been talking to Judy off and on about this case for the last year /.	Judy ! person ; the last year ! date ;
This was a very difficult decision /.	end
and you know what this all comes down to is you keep your promises when you make a promise to a confidential source /.	end
You 'll recall six or eight months ago Howie I was on the show and we were talking about you know did Russert and Kessler and all the rest of those guys did they break some trust by agreeing to testify and observing the waiver /?	six or eight months ago Howie ! date ; Russert ! person ; Kessler ! person ;
What I think this situation and the turmoil that is obviously going on at the Times right now points out is the fact that we have a major problem in this country /.	Times ! org ;
it 's that reporters believe they need to keep their promises to their sources /.	end
Reporters will try to do whatever they can as long as the law allows them to protect those sources /.	end
Right /.	end
But these days um with the state of our law the fact that we do not have a federal shield law we have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of our newsrooms /.	these days ! date ;
and we just can tolerate this /.	end
And we 're trying to /-	end
I think Lucy 's on to something here if I can just say Howie /.	Lucy ! person ; Howie ! person ;
And I think this is very important because this is an ugly case /.	end
And even people close to Judith Miller say this is not the one you 'd really like to go to the mat on /.	Judith Miller ! person ; one ! num ;
You 'd love to have a clear whistle blower case /.	end
You 'd love to have a Pentagon papers case /.	Pentagon ! org ;
You 'd love to have something where the well - being and the sanctity of the Republic you know hangs in the balance /.	Republic ! org ;
She did n't even report on this /.	end
But it does point out a very serious issue /.	end
And that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or do n't have and the propensity of uh the United States government to have more secrecy not less /.	United States ! country ;
We 've got to figure this out /.	end
Well just to clarify uh she did ultimately uh testify about her confidential source /.	end
The whole issue was how voluntary was the waiver of her promise to Scooter Libby offered and why was she able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail /.	Libby ! person ;
Well exactly /.	end
and you know what Howie /. /.	Howie ! person ;
it 's really time for Lucy and other Judy Miller defenders to update her talking points because what Lucy just said just simply does not wash /.	Lucy ! person ; Judy Miller ! person ; Lucy ! person ;
The truth is that as Howie said she did testify /.	Howie ! person ;
The truth is that it 's very clear from the stories today that she could 've asked uh Scooter Libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier /.	today ! date ; Scooter Libby ! person ;
All of that could have happened /.	end
It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /.	Judy Miller ! person ; American ! national ;
And the New York Times is /.	the New York Times ! org ;
Lucy /.	Lucy ! person ;
/.	end
Let me get a response from Lucy Dalglish /.	Lucy Dalglish ! person ;
I think it 's very obvious from what Judy wrote today she is protecting somebody else /.	Judy ! person ; today ! date ;
And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was she negotiating what she was going to say about Scooter Libby but you got to keep in mind I 'm a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /.	one ! num ; Scooter Libby ! person ;
They had to negotiate with Patrick Fitzgerald what he would not talk about /.	Patrick Fitzgerald ! person ;
They also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contacting /.	end
Once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful /.	end
You do n't mess with the Feds /.	end
It 's very clear in her story that she decided finally to testify because she got tired of jail because she was threatened with criminal contempt charges because she wanted to go out and now she 's saying admitting finally write a book /.	end
All these things are there in black and white /.	end
and to continue to portray her as a martyr is not going to work /.	end
And on that point Arianna on that point she says sh- /-	Arianna ! person ;
Excuse me /.	end
Judy Miller says she 's taking some time off from the paper /.	Judy Miller ! person ;
She wants to write a book /.	end
She would n't share her notes with her colleagues who were writing the story /.	end
Do you think she 'll ever come back /?	end
You think she 's saving it for the book /?	end
Well it 's very clear that she would not be welcome in the newsroom /.	end
And it 's very clear eh as I reported again that when Bill Keller took her off her WMD beat they were all hoping she would resign /.	Bill Keller ! person ;
Instead she threw a fit /.	end
but she stayed on /.	end
This is not a journalism one oh one course the way she handled both the WMD reporting and Plame Gate /.	one oh one ! num ; Plame Gate ! thing ;
Frank Sesno please comment /.	end
Jump in /.	end
And Howie I 'll tell you what /.	Howie ! person ;
This is a gigantic shot across the bow of every manager in the news business and every editor and every executive producer anywhere because you got to have some uh control some connection with your correspondants and your reporters /.	end
You got to know who they 're talking to at some level anyway because you know what /?	end
It 's about trust with the public /.	end
and it 's about you know ending up in jail or in court /.	end
their story says that Bill Keller and Arthur Sulzberger did not press Judy Miller about her conversations with Libby or ask to see her notes while they were defending her /.	Bill Keller ! person ; Arthur Sulzberger ! person ; Judy Miller ! person ; Libby ! person ;
Ask to see her /.	end
And by the way we invited the New York Times to have an editor appear on this program /.	the New York Times ! org ;
The paper declined /.	end
When we come back media speculation run amuck over possible indictments at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania and the President 's scripted session with troops in Iraq /.	Pennsylvania ! fact ; Iraq ! country ;
Stay with us /.	end
Welcome back to Reliable Sources /.	Reliable Sources ! art ;
As the CIA leak investigation continued this week media folks did plenty of speculating with no evidence about the possible indictment of a certain top White House official who testified before the grand jury for the fourth time on Friday /.	CIA ! org ; this week ! date ; White House ! org ; fourth ! order ; Friday ! date ;
Karl Rove his closest aide the number two man in the White House the man that has been called Bush 's brain /.	Karl Rove ! person ; number two ! num ; the White House ! org ; Bush ! person ;
If he 's indicted and has to go it undermines the key source of this President 's public support his character /.	end
If Rove gets indicted that could bring down the Bush administration I think /.	Rove ! person ; Bush ! person ;
My understanding from talking to somebody quite close to this investigation is that they think there are going to be indictments /.	end
and possibly Karl Rove could be among them /.	Karl Rove ! person ;
Lucy Dalglish if Karl Rove is indicted , if Karl Rove is indicted , what if he 's not indicted /?	Lucy Dalglish ! person ; Karl Rove ! person ; Karl Rove ! person ;
Is n't this the worst kind of journalistic speculation /?	end
Yeah /.	end
You know I think it 's always dangerous to speculate whether or not you 're really besmirching someone 's reputation . Although I 'm not sure you can do that with Karl Rove /.	Karl Rove ! person ;
But it uh is very very you know eh irre- /-	end
I would prefer that people keep an eye on you know watching him testify and going in and out of the courthouse /.	end
But uh will it bring down the administration /?	end
I do n't know /.	end
Ah eh I do n't know /.	end
Well nobody knows /.	end
That 's the point /.	end
Arianna Huffington I used to cover the justice department /.	Arianna Huffington ! person ;
Not everybody who 's under investigation winds up getting indicted /.	end
Ah but you certainly and you 're uh on a blog so maybe it 's a different standard have speculated about Rove 's fate as well /.	Rove ! person ;
Well not just Rove though /.	Rove ! person ;
what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that Fitzgerald is after the whole Iraq White House group the group that uh in Cheney 's office with Libby and Rove and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the American public based on lies /.	Fitzgerald ! person ; Iraq White House ! country ; Cheney ! org ; Libby ! person ; Rove ! person ; Mary Matalin ! person ; Condoleezza Rice ! person ; American ! person ;
I mean that is really the web /.	end
But it seems and we find out today also from uh um the reporting on the Miller story , that uh Fitzgerald is after Cheney even in some of the questioning eh of Miller /.	today ! date ; Miller ! person ; Fitzgerald ! person ; Cheney ! person ; Miller ! person ;
I think those were fairly routine questions about /.	end
you have Judy Miller there /.	Judy Miller ! person ;
you ask about Cheney /. /.	Cheney ! person ;
He was being thorough /.	end
I think we 're overthinking this whole thing /.	end
Karl Rove and this speculation business you know /.	Karl Rove ! person ;
Frank Sesno /.	Frank Sesno /. ! person ;
Pat Fitzgerald /.	Pat Fitzgerald /. ! person ;
It 's very easy to sit here and say oh we should never speculate in journalism /.	end
It 's irresponsible journalism /.	end
It 's really how you speculate not that you speculate /.	end
The fact of the matter is that Karl Rove has been to the grand jury four times /.	Karl Rove ! person ; four ! num ;
The fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in Washington and believe me they 're not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted /.	Washington ! country ;
It would be irresponsible I think for the media not to reflect what the discussion is here in town /.	end
And there are plenty of Republicans mostly Republicans who are worried about this /.	Republicans ! national ; Republicans ! national ;
Alright I want to turn now to uh President Bush 's uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with US troops in Iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be /.	Bush ! person ; US ! country ; Iraq ! country ;
Let 's take a look at the actual footage /.	end
And in your interactions with the Iraqi civilians in Tikrit Saddam 's hometown how are they reacting to this political process /?	Iraqi ! national ; Tikrit Saddam ! country ;
Sir in the north central area of Iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent /.	Iraq ! country ; seventeen percent ! per ;
Can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in Tikrit /?	Tikrit ! country ;

Are you stunned /?	end

I ca n't believe it /.	end
they rehearsed it /.	end
They rehearsed it /.	end
They rehearsed it /.	end
Yeah you know something /?	end
uh I remember a long time ago Michael Deaver the ultimate image meister for Ronald Reagan said my job is to light the President well and for everything I do to put the President in a good light /.	Michael Deaver ! person ; Ronald Reagan ! person ;
Now look first of all this is uncomfortable to see /.	first ! order ;
and what the problem this now creates for the White House is {is} it plays into the credibility issue that the President has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a rehearsed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on his performance on public support of Iraq the whole bit /.	the White House ! org ; Iraq ! country ;
But the fact that anybody would think that you would do something like this a remote /.	end
I mean anybody in television will tell you that 's complicated business /.	end
You have satellite delay /.	end
You have a half a dozen people sitting there /.	a half a dozen ! num ;
Who 's going to speak when /.	end
You do n't want awkward silences /.	end
You 're going to walk through it /.	end
so that it happened does n't surprise me /.	end
That it hurts the President yeah that 's inevitable too /.	end
Arianna Huffington does the staging here surprise you at all /?	Arianna Huffington ! person ;
Well it 's not the question of surpising me Howie /.	Howie ! person ;
It 's the fact that we are talking about war /.	end
This is not just any photo opportunity /.	end
Of course that 's part and parcel of the presidency /.	end
But we 're talking about a war in which almost two thousand young Americans have died /.	almost two thousand ! num ; Americans ! national ;
And we are also using soldiers as props /.	end
Yes it is shocking /.	end
and I think Keith Olbermann did a phenomenal job at exposing this on MSNBC /.	Keith Olbermann ! person ; MSNBC ! org ;
Alright /.	end
And I think more and more journalists are actually taking a hard look at what this administration is doing /.	end

President Clinton 's former lawyer Lanny Davis takes on Sixty Minutes and ex-FBI director Louis Freeh /.	Clinton ! person ; Lanny Davis ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! org ; ex-FBI ! org ; Louis Freeh ! person ;
And still to come New York Times columnist Tom Friedman /.	New York Times ! org ; Tom Friedman ! person ;
Welcome back /.	end
In our new Talk Back to the Media segment someone who believes he or she 's been treated unfairly by the press gets the chance to sound off and give their side of the controversy /.	Talk Back to the Media ! art ;
Last Sunday Mike Wallace sat down with Louis Freeh who 's peddling a memoir on Sixty Minutes /.	Last Sunday Mike Wallace ! date ; Louis Freeh ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! person ;
and the former FBI director unloaded on the President who appointed him Bill Clinton /.	FBI ! org ; Bill Clinton ! person ;
Among his criticisms the former president 's handling of the nineteen ninety - six Khobar Towers terrorist bombing that killed nineteen US marines in Saudi Arabia /.	nineteen ninety - six Khobar Towers ! date ; nineteen US ! fact ; Saudi Arabia ! num ;
I was very disappointed that the political leadership of the United States uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them /.	the United States ! country ; nineteen ! num ;
to give that order to the director because that 's the order that I got and then to do nothing to assist and facilitate that investigation in fact to undermine it /.	end
The Clinton people were furious at the way Sixty Minutes hailed the segment /.	Clinton ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! org ;
and here to talk back is former Clinton White House attorney Lanny Davis /.	Clinton White House ! person ; Lanny Davis ! org ;
Welcome /.	end
Let 's deal with the substance first /.	first ! order ;
Louis Freeh says that when Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah in nineteen ninety - eight , he did n't press for FBI access to suspects in the Khobar Towers bombing and he hit up the prince for a contribution to his presidential library /.	Louis Freeh ! person ; Clinton ! person ; Crown Prince Abdullah ! person ; nineteen ninety - eight ! date ; FBI ! org ; Khobar Towers ! fact ;
Well not only is that false and President Clinton has said so but everybody who attended the meeting not including Louis Freeh says it 's false /.	Clinton ! person ; Louis Freeh ! person ;
And my problem with Sixty Minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /.	end
Until Friday afternoon we did n't even know the charge was being made /.	Friday afternoon ! time ;
And even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict Mister Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
Sixty Minutes says Bill Clinton was offered a chance to come on and give his rebuttal /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ; Bill Clinton ! person ;
What 's wrong with that /?	end
Well first of all it 's absolutely amazing that Sixty Minutes thinks it 's okay to air a false and malicious statement /.	first ! order ; Sixty Minutes ! org ;
This is a terrible charge that an FBI investigation was thwarted because President Clinton wanted to receive money for his library /.	FBI ! org ; Clinton ! person ;
The charge was false /.	end
and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the United States /?	the United States ! country ;
What about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /?	end
What about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /?	end
That 's my problem /.	end
What about Sandy Berger the former national security advisor under President Clinton /?	Sandy Berger ! person ; Clinton ! person ;
He was at the meeting /.	end
He was in the room /.	end
Did you offer him for an on - camera interview /?	end
Well on Friday afternoon /.	Friday afternoon ! time ;
You were n't there /.	end
I was not there /.	end
You 're good on television /.	end
but you were n't there /.	end
uh I talked to Sandy Berger /.	Sandy Berger ! person ;
We issued a statement from Mister Berger /.	Berger ! person ;
but this was Friday afternoon when we first learned about it with Sunday broadcast /.	Friday afternoon ! time ; first ! order ; Sunday ! date ;
Why did n't Sixty Minutes invite Mister Berger or other people at the meeting before Friday afternoon /?	Sixty Minutes ! org ; Berger ! person ; Friday afternoon ! time ;
Why did it take us to get Sixty Minutes to do basic reporting to verify facts /?	Sixty Minutes ! org ;
It 's not enough to have Louis Freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /.	Louis Freeh ! person ;
That 's poor journalism /.	end
On that point let me read a statement from a Sixty Minutes spokesman /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ;
And this involves uh their saying that they contacted Clinton 's office back in August with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the President 's people said he did not want to be interviewed /.	Clinton ! person ; August ! date ;
They gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until Lanny Davis launched his PR campaign on the Thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack Freeh rather than deal with his allegations /.	Lanny Davis ! person ; the Thursday before the broadcast ! date ; Freeh ! person ;
Denials from President Clinton and Sandy Berger that did deal with Freeh 's allegations were included in the Sixty Minutes report /.	Clinton ! person ; Sandy Berger ! person ; Freeh ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! art ;
Well first of all it 's false to say that I was asking to disparage Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
I was asking to talk about facts that Freeh was saying that were not true /.	Freeh ! person ;
You do n't mind disparaging Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
my observation /.	end
no in fact I disparage any man who as FBI director has a personal pique rather than doing his job /.	FBI ! org ;
That 's disparaging /.	end
Secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /.	Secondly ! order ; just the week before ! date ;
When Mister Carson the representative spoke to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace agreed that they had never verified what Mister uh Freeh had said /.	Carson ! person ; Wallace ! person ; Wallace ! person ; Freeh ! person ;
They never talked to Mister Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
and in fact it was n't until that Friday that we learned the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges /.	that Friday ! date ; Freeh ! person ;
So Sixty Minutes I think has just said something that is false /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ;
When did the Clinton team find out that Sixty Minutes was going to report that Louis Freeh with his new book was going to have a specific allegation about Clinton 's handling of the Khobar Towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /.	Clinton ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! org ; Louis Freeh ! person ; Khobar Towers ! fact ;
When somebody named Howard Kurtz wrote a story in the Washington Post on Friday morning is the first time that the Clinton forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that Mister Freeh made a false charge /.	Howard Kurtz ! person ; the Washington Post ! org ; Friday morning ! time ; first ! order ; Clinton ! person ; Freeh ! person ;
And even since that interview Mister Freeh has backed off and has not told people who his source is /.	Freeh ! person ;
and he has n't even insisted that it was true /.	end
He just said somebody told him it was true /.	end
Hold on /.	end
Sixty Minutes spokesman Kevin Tedesco said in the statement I just referred to that the Clinton office was contacted in August with a detailed list of charges /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ; Kevin Tedesco ! person ; Clinton ! person ; August ! date ;
That 's false /.	end
Are you saying that 's false /?	end
They were never told /. /.	end
or at least I 'm now basing this on what Mister Carson has told me /.	Carson ! person ;
Jay Carson is the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton /.	Jay Carson ! person ; Bill Clinton ! person ;
Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true /.	Jay Carson ! person ; Clinton ! person ; the Khobar Towers ! fact ;
President Clinton at that uh meeting did press the uh Crown Prince to cooperate with the FBI /.	Clinton ! person ; FBI ! org ;
so what Mister Freeh said was false /.	Freeh ! person ;
That was not understood by the Clinton people until it was read in the Washington Post in the story that you wrote because Sixty Minutes put a press release out /.	Clinton ! person ; the Washington Post ! org ; Sixty Minutes ! org ;
Uh now look Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes gave Bill Clinton one hour last year to push his own ten million dollar autobiography /.	Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes ! person ; Bill Clinton one hour last year ! org ; ten million dollar ! person ;
He criticized people /.	end
He criticized Ken Starr /.	Ken Starr ! person ;
They did n't have Ken Starr on to rebut /.	Ken Starr ! person ;
Now the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation uh who ca n't stand Clinton clearly writes a book gets one segment for his book /.	the Federal Bureau of Investigation ! org ; Clinton ! person ; one ! num ;
and you cry foul /.	end
Nobody was complaining about when Bill Clinton was getting all this airtime on CBS /.	Bill Clinton ! person ; CBS ! org ;
Look /.	end
Look this is a program about good journalism /.	end
Let 's ask a Sixty Minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former FBI director as whether it 's true or not /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ; FBI ! org ;
Is it good enough to air it just because he says it /.	end
or should you do reporting /?	end
Good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton /.	Clinton ! person ;
Let 's see whether it 's true and start making phone calls /.	end
They did not do that /.	end
That 's a fact /.	end
Alright Lanny Davis thanks very much for coming on to Talk Back to the Media this morning /.	Lanny Davis ! person ; Talk Back to the Media this morning ! art ;

I 'm not here to make a news point though /.	end
I 'm really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism /.	end

How we ever going to win this war /?	end

And it 's been I 've always felt the Achille 's heel /.	Achille ! person ;
You know my criticism of the Bush administration as you know we 've talked about this before is not that this war is not important /.	Bush ! person ;
I believe it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized /.	end
But it 's so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge /.	end
And on that trip you put on body armor /.	end
their rifles were out /.	end
Yeah /.	end
Um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /?	end
You 're there /.	end
you 're being protected /.	end
and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /.	end
Well I 'll tell you what 's really frustrating from a journalist 's point of view as one who have lived in Beirut for nearly five years covered that war /.	Beirut ! country ; nearly five years ! date ;
When I worked in Lebanon you could go anywhere on that story /.	Lebanon ! country ;
You could cross lines /.	end
Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.	Terry Anderson ! person ;
Therefore by the end of the Lebanon story I thought the best journalists there knew more than the Lebanese /.	Lebanon ! country ; Lebanese ! national ;
I always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much /.	Lebanese ! national ;
What 's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird 's eye view /.	Iraq ! country ; Howie ! person ;
I care passionately about this story /.	end
I 'm so interested in it /.	end
but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom you want /.	end
And the brave reporters who are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.	every day ! date ;
And therefore it 's limited /.	end
and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.	end
There 's a lot of good things going on in Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
There 's a lot of progress being made we 're not seeing reported by the press /.	end
Do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?	end
No because I do n't have a bird 's eye view /.	end
I wish I could say /.	end
I wish I could be so sure /.	end
but General Casey does n't have a bird 's eye view /.	Casey ! person ;
And that 's why we get surprises in Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
Uh that 's why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out /.	eight million ! num ;
and maybe you know we 're going to see more surpises in the coming future there /.	end
But because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n't have that bird 's eye view /.	end
And as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story I find that really frustra- /-	end
I can not report it the way I 'd love to /.	end
So I 've been there five times /.	five ! num ;
but it 's episodic /.	end
It 's here /.	end
It 's there /.	end
It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.	end
pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake /.	recent months ! date ; Iraq ! country ; Katrina ! thing ; Rita ! thing ; Tom DeLay ! person ; Harriet Miers ! person ; Valerie Plame ! person ; Pakistan ! country ;
Um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /.	end
and these are all also important stories obviously /.	end
but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?	end
Yeah /.	end
No because to me this is the whole ballgame of the Bush administration /.	Bush ! person ;
Katrina and Rita they 'll come and go /.	Katrina ! thing ; Rita ! thing ;
but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.	Bush ! person ; Iraq ! country ;
If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /.	Bush ! person ;
Um if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.	end
so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the American people /.	American ! national ;
These are huge stakes involved /.	end
And so I do n't think it 's gotten the attention it 's deserved /.	end
And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.	Iraq ! country ; Iraqi ! national ;
The slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the US and British advisors out tomorrow the whole Iraqi navy would collapse /.	US ! country ; British ! national ; tomorrow ! date ; Iraqi ! national ;
That 's a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what the White House and the Defense Department say every day /.	the White House ! org ; the Defense Department ! org ; every day ! date ;
/.	end
Not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained Iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration /.	Iraqi ! national ;
So you 're saying there 's a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record /.	end
You quoted one US senior official and what the President of the United States and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense are saying to reporters every day /.	one US ! num ; the United States ! country ; Defense ! country ; every day ! org ;
Are we calling them on that /?	end
Right I do n't think enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically /.	Howie ! person ;
And a lot of numbers are thrown out /.	end
Eighty thousand this week we 've got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week /.	Eighty thousand this week ! num ; a hundred and twenty thousand next week ! date ;
Here 's what you learn when you go to Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
Where you have an Iraqi commander who 's a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /.	Iraqi ! national ;
And where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.	end
So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.	end
So I went down to see the navy there /.	end
The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander /.	Iraq ! country ;
so the people around him they 'll follow him into battle /.	end
But you take that one guy out there 's no Iraqi navy /.	one ! num ; Iraqi ! national ;
and it 's true of units all over the country /.	end
That 's really the key /.	end
You say that you are angry uh that Bush has fought the war as though it would be easy /.	Bush ! person ;
Are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so /?	end
Yes /.	end
Absolutely because I believe this is important /.	end
I believe that something very big is at stake /.	end
We 're dealing with a Muslim Arab civilization right now that 's that 's in decline , that 's heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and I believe dangerous for the stability of the world /.	Muslim Arab ! national ;
There 's something really important here at stake /.	end
and what makes me so angry at the Bush administration is not that they did n't frame the stakes /.	Bush ! person ;
It is important /.	end
But they never never appreciated how difficult it was /.	end
They never prepared the army or the American people for how difficult it was /.	American ! national ;
I mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in Pakistan a region you 're familiar with /.	Pakistan ! country ;
Um clearly it 's become a pretty big story /.	end
but for the first couple days I noticed it was n't that much of a television story /.	the first couple days ! date ;
and the reason was no pictures no video /.	end
No yes /.	end
Um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it 's in a remote part of the world /?	end

and uh let 's just say that it did n't say you walked on water but it came close /.	end
Uh but one of the criticisms /-	end
What 's wrong with that /?	end
It says that you 're the composer of the nation 's talking points which was news to me /.	end
Uh one of the things it said was that uh in your book and in your writing that CEOs play a very central role /.	end
And the suggestion was well CEOs love you , you 're asked to speak at all these corporate events , maybe because you give them a very large uh share of the narrative /.	end
Yeah /.	end
Mhm /.	end
Mhm /.	end
That a reasonable observation /?	end
Yeah it is a reasonable observation /.	end
And my reaction to that is look if I want to understand the underlying technology that is flattening the world who do I go to /?	end
do I go to I do n't know Central America /?	Central America ! location ;
Do I go to um uh the factory floor /?	end
Or do I go to the innovators and entrepeneurs who actually put all this together /?	end

There are n't enough people during the last few years who actually went out and talked to the innovators who are doing all of these things who are actually reshaping the world /.	the last few years ! date ;

I would say that there 's several things happened basically in the last three years /.	the last three years ! date ;
I would call it a perfect storm /.	end
One was nine eleven /.	One ! num ; nine eleven ! thing ;
That distracted us okay /.	end
The other was the Enron effect /.	Enron ! org ;
You know no one wanted to be sort of seen with CEOs /.	end
And number three was the dot com bust which made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /.	number three ! num ;
And as a result I would argue that really masked what is actually a fundemental inflection point the flattening of the world that we 're going from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /.	end
The argument of this book is that that shift is actually going to have as big an effect over time as Gutenberg and the printing press /.	Gutenberg ! person ;

Eliminate the personal income tax -LRB- Reproduced from Yueguang blog -RRB- .	Yueguang blog ! art ;
Dift Wu	Dift Wu ! person ;
Official data confirm that in 2004 the total personal income tax for the country amounted to approximately 181 billion , of which 65 % came from the working class , and only 10 % came from the wealthy .	2004 ! date ; approximately 181 billion ! num ; 65 % ! per ; 10 % ! per ;
Clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners .	end
While this type of tax in China has no effect on regulating the income gap or on " taking from the rich to help the poor , " neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class .	China ! country ;
If this tax continues to be collected , it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax .	end
Clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged .	end
I propose eliminating the personal income tax just as the agricultural tax was eliminated , to give people an opportunity to prosper .	end
If we think in terms of humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by letting poor people get rich , we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for China 's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person .	China ! country ; 800 yuan ! money ; 6400 yuan ! money ;
That would take it to a minimally humanized level , and then we could really talk about " people first . "	first ! order ;
With a threshold below this level , the poor will always be poor .	end
Yesterday CCTV presented a program on adjustment of the personal income tax , emphasized that the main goal of the adjustment was to " take from the rich " and let poor people get wealthy .	CCTV ! org ;
If we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy , the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled .	end
With anything under this threshold , the poor will have no chance to get rich .	end
And if we 're looking at it in terms of " taking from the rich , " the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing China 's social national income , namely how to eliminate the " unreported income . "	China ! country ;
The income of the vast majority of China 's rich people is unreported income , and unreported income is a problem that Chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of China , an uncontrollable black hole in China 's social oversight .	China ! country ; Chinese ! national ; China ! country ; China ! country ;
This is far from being a tax problem ; it is a deeper systemic problem .	end
If China 's personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich , neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy , so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do ?	China ! country ;
It would be better to eliminate it in one fell swoop , as we did with the agricultural tax .	one ! num ;
Below are some of the main reasons :	end
1. China 's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat .	1. China ! num ;
In China the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state 's financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap .	China ! country ;
In 2004 China 's income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion , accounting for about 6 % of the state 's financial revenues .	2004 China ! date ; approximately 180 billion ! country ; about 6 % ! num ;
But of this 180 billion , about 65 % , or 117 billion , was paid by the working class .	180 billion ! num ; about 65 % ! per ; 117 billion ! num ;
Less than 10 % was paid by the wealthy .	Less than 10 % ! per ;
In China more than 90 % of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor .	China more than 90 % ! country ;
These poor people , who struggle just to pay for the necessities of life , their children 's education , old age , illness and death , also have to pay income tax .	end
In all of China 's cities now , anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor .	China ! country ; 2000 yuan or less ! money ;
If a husband and wife have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan , and if they pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan , they have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan .	2000 yuan ! money ; 33 % ! per ; over 1500 yuan ! money ; 1670 yuan ! money ;
A household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses , and their standard of living will decline .	end
And should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital , the family may well find itself in an economic crisis .	end
And if a family like this wants to buy its own home , that will basically be impossible .	end
And if only one person in a three - person family is employed , the family will have a very difficult life .	one ! num ; three ! num ;
But even so , they have to pay 165 yuan in income tax .	165 yuan ! money ;
Clearly , if our income tax threshold is set at 1500 yuan , our society is destined always to produce a proletariat , always to deny hope to the poor or to the masses of ever getting rich .	1500 yuan ! money ;
Our production relations are no different from the production relations in Marx 's " Das Kapital , " constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living .	Marx ! person ; Das Kapital ! art ;
In short , if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan , it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich .	6400 yuan ! money ;
Conversely , if the threshold is too low , it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich .	end
2. The personal income tax is absolutely unable to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich .	2. ! num ;
We should not entertain any illusions that China 's income tax can in any way regulate income distribution , much less that it can " take from the rich and give to the poor . "	China ! country ;
In Chinese society , 20 % of the people hold 80 % of social wealth , and 80 % of the people are able to use only 20 % of the social wealth to suffer through their lives .	Chinese ! national ; 20 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ; 20 % ! per ;
In China , freedom , human rights , democracy , happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20 % of the people .	China ! country ; 20 % ! per ;
Western countries that attack China for not having human rights , democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; these 20 % of upper - class citizens have broader human rights , democracy and freedom than do Western societies .	China ! country ; these 20 % ! per ;
When God looks at China , he sees only these 20 % ; the other 80 % he ca n't see clearly .	China ! country ; these 20 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ;
The income of the vast majority of these 20 , of upper - class citizens in China is basically unreported income ; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth .	20 ! num ; China ! country ;
Only if China eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people .	China ! country ;
And if China wants to eliminate unreported income , to date there is no sign of that , and there is no compelling evidence to explain when China might eliminate unreported income .	China ! country ; China ! country ;
Anyhow , it is not something our generation will see .	end
That is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of China 's rich people .	China ! country ;
It does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability of poor people to get rich .	end
A very simple explanation is that poor people are all wage earners who rely on fully declared wages for their living ; they do not have unreported income .	end
Fully 100 % of their income falls within the income - tax field of vision , so they ca n't escape even if they wanted to .	100 % ! per ;
Add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required to meet the necessary expenditures to maintain the basic necessities of life , and the poor are completely stymied .	end
" Dragons give birth to dragons , phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave . "	end
" The children of poor people are always poor . "	end
With the previous 800 yuan income tax threshold , if it were strictly enforced , 80 % of beggars would have to pay .	800 yuan ! money ; 80 % ! per ;
With a threshold set below 5000 yuan , this generation of poor people need not think about buying a home or driving a car .	5000 yuan ! money ;
They will always be poor .	end
Of course , many children of poor people are able to get rich , but this came about because the parents struggled harder , tightening their belts and " skimping on food and clothing " for themselves .	end
Now how many university students who have received acceptance notifications are unable to enroll , and how many enrolled university students from the countryside have parents who are living through unimaginably hard times ?	end
In Western countries , the personal income tax is the most effective means of controlling excessively high incomes among the rich .	end
But these are countries ruled by law , where official income is all recorded , citizen 's incomes are fully transparent , and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of regulating income distribution .	end
The situation in China is not like that ; if the personal income tax has an effect , it 's to increase financial revenues , and it has absolutely no income - regulating effect .	China ! country ;
3. Eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants .	3. ! num ;
The vast majority of China 's 900 million peasants are unable to reach the income level for paying income tax .	900 million ! num ;
But the peasants have contractual land , they have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions , and they have basic housing .	end
But if people in the cities do n't have money , everything is a struggle .	end
If they go shopping for food by bike , they have to pay 20 cents for parking .	20 cents ! money ;

In terms of macroeconomic law , the distribution of wealth in Chinese society is set at 2/8 , with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth , and the 80 % of poor people holding just 20 % of the social wealth .	Chinese ! national ; 2/8 ! num ; the 20 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ; the 80 % ! per ; 20 % ! per ;
The personal income tax threshold is too low , the urban population is too large , and the population participating in the 20 % that goes to peasants is even greater , so the peasants ultimately have to get a reduced share of this 20 % .	the 20 % ! per ; this 20 % ! per ;
If we eliminate the personal income tax , the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced , and the people participating in the peasant struggle for this 20 % will be reduced , which will benefit the peasants .	this 20 % ! per ;
In China the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person .	China ! country ; 80 % ! per ;
4. This will really be beneficial in establishing a soft - landing market economy system .	4. ! num ;
In recent years China 's rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth ; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon , and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained , healthy growth of the national economy .	recent years China ! date ;
The blood has all been pumped out of the national economy ; it 's like eating up all the seeds sown in the spring .	end
The proportion of financial revenues from the personal income tax is about 6 % .	about 6 % ! per ;
If we cancel out this 6 % , we can slow down financial growth .	this 6 % ! per ;
And in the Chinese economic cycle , excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system .	Chinese ! national ;
Compared to market investment , the efficiency of financial investment is less than half .	less than half ! num ;
And when there is too much financial investment , corruption is everywhere , all the time .	end
5. It promotes the establishment of a harmonious society .	5. ! num ;
Chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor , middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle , with 40 % or more of the society being middle class .	Chinese ! national ; 40 % or more ! per ;
Chinese society is 80 % poor people , 20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class , or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable .	Chinese ! national ; 80 % ! per ; 20 % ! per ;
There is no way this " 2/8 " social structure can establish a harmonious society .	2/8 ! num ;
Eliminating the personal income tax to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society .	end
In short , if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich , and is unable to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich , then it is better not to have this kind of personal income tax .	end
We need to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter , so as to benefit the country and the people .	end
This essay is dedicated to all the hardworking people of the world .	end

A month ago , I was really desperate , I lost my current job , which I was completely unprepared for , and had to find a job within a month to keep myself going .	A month ago ! date ; a month ! date ;
Now in this month with the Christmas holiday there 's really only three weeks of actual work time , and I do n't think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period .	this month ! date ; Christmas ! thing ; three weeks ! date ;
Despair , that sinking feeling weighing on my mind , so much pressure I could n't eat , could n't sleep ; I was simply going crazy .	end
But I still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense .	end
Then I started connecting with my friends in America ; I went to Maimaiti to ask for help , consulted about my status , and looked for a way to solve the problem .	America ! country ; Maimaiti ! person ;
Even my relatives ' friends in America and my parents ' friends all got involved .	America ! country ;
Friends , it 's always friends who help me at key moments .	end
Many friends got people they knew to recommend me , help me send out resumes , or call and commiserate with me .	end
There was one friend who had just got an offer , but he did n't want to go , so he recommended me to go for him , but it was way off in LA , plus the salary was n't ideal , but at least it could help me keep the legal status , so I thought I would take it .	one ! num ; LA ! country ;

After that the boss took me to the home office , and on the way he gave me an oral offer , and he said it would not be easy for me to come right away , that I should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork , wait until after New Year 's , and the HR director would return and turn in the H1 .

Advice to Wu Jinglian and Others : Killing the Father -- Does You No Good ! .	Wu Jinglian ! person ;
-- Some Thoughts on the Attitude of Benign Inheritance towards Social Reform .	end
A glance at the title , people with a little political sensitivity may roughly understand the core topic of this article : the rule of benign interaction between planned economy and market economy , and between public ownership and private ownership -- because only their relationships are those between a father and a son , and it is only between them are there different conflicts involving " human relations , " " rules " and " science , " as well as bloody wrestling between classes , factions and individuals on the basis of morality and interests .	end
Comparing planned economy and public ownership to a father is tantamount to comparing market economy and private ownership to a son , which holds water principally and historically no matter you put it this way or another .	end
This is because the former two given " fatherhood " are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China , while the latter two dubbed " son " in this article -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of China 's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership , which grew into today 's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up .	two ! num ; socialist ! national ; China ! country ; China ! country ; Mao Zedong ! person ; today ! date ; 30 years ! date ;
Regarding this , the factual development process of political civilization that the Marxist ideology has been increasingly marginalized over the past 30 years or so is a strong evidence .	Marxist ! national ; the past 30 years ! date ;
By sorting out the essence of the above historical background and conceptual relationships , we will have a pretty thorough , comprehensive and systematic knowledge framework about the benign inevitable trends and development guidelines of the future society dependent on the rule of society , so that the associated impression captured may be more concrete .	end
Regarding this , my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy , public ownership and the people 's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really " fresh " systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to , no matter how scientific its kernel is , it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems .	China ! country ; the mid and late 20th century ! date ;
However , this should not provide an excuse to overthrow it by fair means or foul , as he is our father and the common choice of millions of laboring people .	millions ! num ;
The fact that it " finally became our national character and main system after over half a century of international and domestic political transformation " is a stronger proof that it is the milestone for a new civilization resulted from the blood and sweat of thousands of proletarian revolutionary martyrs .	half a century ! date ; thousands ! num ;
Therefore , no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government , we should respect and develop her on the basis of inheritance , innovation and improvement .	end
Is my opinion above correct ?	end
I believe you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat the above - mentioned " father " system and " son " system with impartiality and sufficient goodwill .	end
For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : the " father " system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country , the nation , and the overall society -- while the " son " system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery .	end
So , we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences , because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal .	end
It is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development , distorts normal " human relations " and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous .	end
Yes , this is the case .	end
My opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all , because this is true not only in theory , but also to the rule of social development as demonstrated by historical facts , as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of the country : None of the current " advocates of market economy , private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie " has established and proposed a new deal " against planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat . "	end
All their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as " lower efficiency due to centralized management " or " inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal , " all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 % " vested interests , " and their development logic asks the " 95 % " laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure the hard work -- it speaks for itself how empty , ridiculous , sick , ignorant and anti-government it is .	less than 5 % ! per ; " 95 % " ! per ;
That 's why I want to say to the world and the age by the end of the article : when the father 's toes are injured , we should try our best to treat the foot problem , and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of respecting human relations , obeying people 's wishes , conforming to science and carrying on the legacy -- if the present capitalist followers frantically urge the son to kill him by all means , the result could only be a tragedy !	end
And these happen to be the core of the destiny where the capitalist roaders " will inevitably bury themselves due to their ignorance and insanity , and more or less harm the human society ! "	end
At last , I would like to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who blindly oppose , hate and even suppress planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat , especially the " mainstream elite scholars " including Wu Jinglian , who insist on smearing the " father " to the end : do not treat the " fathers " on which the new civilization is based barbarously , against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains .	Wu Jinglian ! person ;
The result is definitely a tragedy -- because even if you kill the " father , " your felony will be disdained by the age and condemned by the people , which naturally leads to nothing good !	end

Guo Kai 's Economic Notes	Guo Kai 's Economic Notes ! person ;
In the US the current average price of regular unleaded gas is about 2.3 US dollars per gallon -LRB- 3.78 liters -RRB- .	US ! country ; 2.3 US dollars ! money ; -LRB- 3.78 liters -RRB- ! measure ;
According to the official exchange rate of one US dollar for 7.9 RMB , this price is equivalent to 4.80 yuan / liter .	one US dollar ! money ; 7.9 RMB ! money ; 4.80 yuan ! money ;
Note , this gas price includes all taxes .	end
The current gas price in Beijing is 5.09 yuan / liter , 2 mao and 9 fen more than in the US .	Beijing ! country ; 5.09 yuan ! money ; 2 mao and 9 fen ! money ; US ! country ;
In fact , the gas price difference between the two places is larger than 2 mao and 9 fen because China 's gas price does not include so many taxes as in the US ; for example , the highway maintenance fee in China is paid separately .	two ! num ; 2 mao and 9 fen ! money ; China ! country ; US ! country ; China ! country ;
Just now , I only narrated a fact .	end
But I believe that different persons see different problems in this fact .	end
Let me describe people 's two reactions that I can imagine , or the two problems I can see .	two ! num ; two ! num ;
1. The US gas price is too cheap .	1. ! num ; US ! country ;
In an absolute sense , the US gas price has +already been cheaper than China 's , and in a relative sense , the US gas price is even cheaper .	US ! country ; China ! country ; US ! country ;
In the US , the money you pay for a meal at McDonald 's can fill up more than 10 liters of gas , but in Beijing you can get 5 - 6 liters of gas at most .	US ! country ; McDonald ! org ; 10 liters ! measure ; Beijing ! country ; 5 - 6 liters ! measure ;
The US low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country 's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources .	US ! country ;
However , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the US excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc.	US ! country ;
It is totally a joke that the US gas price could be cheaper than China 's .	US ! country ; China ! country ;
2. China 's gas price is too expensive .	2. China ! num ;
Both Americans and Chinese buy gas from the international market , and the technology and cost of oil refinement are not too much different .	Americans ! national ; Chinese ! national ;
But with the US gas price including taxes even lower than China 's gas price excluding taxes , you can see how much money Chinese oil companies have made out of this .	US ! country ; China ! country ; Chinese ! national ;
If there are no price controls and monopolies , China 's gas price should n't have been this high .	China ! country ;
I want to say that I think these two opinions are both correct .	two ! num ;
So , on the issue of oil consumption , I think China and the US , the No. 1 and No. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair .	China ! country ; US ! country ; 1 ! num ; 2 ! num ;
From a global perspective , the US gas price is obviously too low .	US ! national ;
So Mankiw at Harvard even formed a " Pigou Club , " gathering social celebrities who support levying higher taxes on gas prices -LRB- hereby raising gas prices -RRB- .	Mankiw ! person ; Harvard ! org ;
China 's gas prices are more complicated .	China ! country ;
In fact , gas prices in China are probably not very high , but in order to reduce China 's future overdependence on gas , it may be better that China 's gas prices are higher .	China ! country ; China ! country ; China ! country ;
But , the direct result of the gas price increase in China will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies .	China ! country ;
This part of money will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better .	end
In other words , the gas price in China is too high in the distributive sense .	China ! country ;
It is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people .	end
But in terms of sustainability , China 's gas price may still be too low .	China ! country ;
We need high gas prices to control the overdependence on energy imports .	end
Perhaps someone will condemn me , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people .	end
If you are a taxi driver , my reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of our taxi licensing regulation system .	end
If you are a car owner , my reply is : ride the subway and bus more often .	end
It saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say " life is unbearable . "	end
Compared with most people , your life is already quite good .	end

Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- Tue Jan 16 22:51:46 2007 -RRB- .	Tue Jan 16 22:51:46 2007 ! date ;
I have deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article Breakneck 90 m/h on a Snowy Night .	90 m/h ! measure ;
It also reminds me of something that I experienced several years ago , also related to an airport and meeting people .	several years ago ! date ;
A couple of years ago , my neighbor approached me to borrow my car , saying he was meeting his parents at the airport .	A couple of years ago ! date ;
He also said both his wife and children wanted to go .	end
As his car was too small and mine was big , it could make his parents more comfortable .	end
He added that he would only use it for one morning and would return it to me before noon .	one morning ! time ; noon ! time ;
Although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me , we lived in the same apartment building after all and were both Chinese .	Chinese ! national ;
So I discussed with my wife back home and lent him the car as we thought we would not be using the car until the same afternoon .	the same afternoon ! time ;
And then something happened ...	end
At 1:00pm , the neighbor called me , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm .	1:00pm ! time ; 3:00pm ! time ;
I of course agreed and asked them not to rush .	end
This wait lasted till 5:30pm , when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures .	5:30pm ! time ; half ! num ;
I comforted him first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital .	first ! order ;
My neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my neighbor 's fault .	end
He clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn .	end
My car was completely damaged and had been towed away .	end
I forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -LRB- mine was liability - only coverage -RRB- and asked the friend to send their family home .	end
And then the nightmare began .	end
The next day , my neighbor called me , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from	The next day ! date ;
I told him part would be covered by my car insurance .	end
After a while , he called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford	end
I tried my best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly	end
Just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this .	several dozen thousand bucks ! money ;
She also said my car was a Japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident .	Japanese ! national ;
She added that I should pay the money because the car was mine .	end
I hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on .	end
My wife -LSB- pw% -RSB- had been persuading me aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury .	end
She asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first .	first ! order ;
So I did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry .	end
Out of my expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea .	third ! order ;
The telephone rang just as I was about to go to work in the morning .	end
I thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily .	end
Unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man .	end
He said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me if I compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -LRB- three times -RRB- , otherwise they would see me in court .	three ! num ;
He added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court .	ten years ! date ;
As a great Chinese guy , how could I be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ?	Chinese ! national ;
I also took up the weapon of law for justice .	end
Of course , I also retained a lawyer .	end
Out of my expectation , my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls .	two ! num ;
One was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident .	One ! num ;
There was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them .	end
Someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station .	end
The police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch .	end
The second call was to their lawyer .	second ! order ;
So their lawyer dropped the lawsuit .	end
Of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening .	end
The most classic one was : Do n't ever dream of living a life back to China , as we have people across the country .	China ! country ;
Disgusting !	end
Here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks .	end
I think many people will say they wo n't .	end
I would suggest not to lend online .	end
However , the Internet is after all virtual .	end
Words sometimes have no emotions .	end
When your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a " no ? "	end
Anyhow , I was not able to do that .	end
I lent my car to some people in need after that , and I believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple .	end
In conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : .	two ! num ;
Our side : A 02 Camary of 50,000 miles , retaining fee 200 . Annual leave two days .	02 Camary ! date ; 50,000 miles ! product ; 200 ! measure ; two ! num ;
Their side : One leg of the father -LRB- repaired -RRB- , hospital charge : unknown , costs for missing work hours : unknown , retaining fee : unknown .	One ! num ;
And most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -LRB- except children -RRB- .	end

Saddam 's last days and what is said he was like	Saddam ! person ; last ! order ;
Bu Thari	Bu Thari ! person ;
What we know about Saddam Hussein in recent years is that he had changed a lot .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; recent years ! date ;
He had Islamic tendecies and acts which many Iraqis mentioned , saying that Saddam supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing Koran , and charities , and the dancer 's punishment was death .	Islamic ! national ; Iraqis ! national ; Saddam ! person ; Koran ! art ;
He had many works .	end
But some explained his Islamic tendency by saying that he was currying favor with the Sunnis as if they were reading his mind .	Islamic ! person ; Sunnis ! national ;
I have followed Saddam Hussein , especially in recent years , and I noticed about him was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; recent years ! date ;
And his punishment was unjust .	end
I mean , for example , the dancer would be killed after second offence .	second ! order ;
I did not expect anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it , but like the most idiots his aim was correct but the method was wrong .	end
Another example - after his son Udai harmed the Iraqi people and attacked women and other matters , Saddam ordered him to be killed .	Udai ! person ; Iraqi ! national ; Saddam ! person ;
And in fact he was fired on but survived miraculously , after being hit with several fatal shots some of which hit his spine .	end
This is a sign that there was good in him otherwise he would not have ordered the killing of his son , his own child .	end
But he was not a scholar nor feared in God .	end
I myself heard from some people who were in Iraq about the things that Saddam Hussein used to do , and could not be reasonably done by anyone other than a good Moslem To the extent that many said of his actions that they were only to gain favor amongst the Sunnis and the religious .	Iraq ! country ; Saddam Hussein ! person ; Moslem ! national ; Sunnis ! national ;
But we judge by the appearances and his end was in line with the appearance .	end
In his last days during the fall of Baghdad and his disappearance , an old woman or man said on TV on al - Jazeera channel that he was hiding in her house and had had his prayer mat with him and was always praying and reading the Koran .	last ! order ; Baghdad ! country ; al - Jazeera ! org ; Koran ! art ;
Do we say no , this is hypocrisy ?	end
Bear in mind that many have said that Saddam prayed regularly especially after he was put in prison by the Rafida and their masters .	Saddam ! person ; Rafida ! person ;
Some of those who said that he was always praying and reading the Koran are the Christians who visited him in his prison cell .	Koran ! art ; Christians ! national ;
Finally , during his hanging , the Rafida tried to distract him and keep him from saying the Creed before his death .	Rafida ! person ;
They were trying everything they could but we say that God made him steadfast for the whole world to see that he died acknowledging God .	end
The Rafida were shouting provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr so that he would lose control and curse them , then they would have killed him .	Rafida ! person ; Muqtada ! person ; al - Sadr ! person ;
So they could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from Saddam and cut the rest .	Saddam ! person ;
However he remained steadfast in saying the creed and was killed whilst saying it .	end
I believe that this could n't have happened without God making him steadfast otherwise God would not have made him steadfast in it .	end
As one of the sheikhs says , many people when they were supposed to say the creed and were being dictated the creed by those present would murmur " Did love see drunkards ? "	one ! num ;
Other people say , I have not said it while I was alive and you want me to say it when I am dying ... the truth is what is apparent .	end
But Saddam Hussein was reasonable in that he repented and turned to his creator who receives the repentance from his slave .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
And he committed himself to the worship of God . And remained loyal to God .	end
I ask God to have mercy on him and to forgive him and to give him an ample dwelling in his paradise and guide the rest of the Ba'thists .	Ba'thists ! national ;

At the start of the conversation President Saddam appeared extremely calm .	Saddam ! person ;
Perhaps he was surprised that his guest was Rumsfeld , but he did not appear at all nervously tense .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Rumsfeld began the conversation by saying Rumsfeld : I came to meet you to negotiate the situation in Iraq ; we have made contact with some of your followers inside and outside Iraq , they have advised us to listen to you .	Rumsfeld ! person ; Rumsfeld ! person ; Iraq ! country ; Iraq ! country ;
Saddam Hussein : So what do you want ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Your forces have occupied the territory of the proud Iraq , you have brought down the governing regime without a legal support ,	Iraq ! country ;
you have assaulted the sovereignty of an independent free sovereign country ,	end
you have committed crimes which history will record against you as evidence of your blood - stained civilization .	end
So what do you want after all that ?	end
Rumsfeld -LRB- trying to suppress his anger -RRB- : What 's past is past , I came especially to make you a clear and specific offer and I want to hear from you a clear and definite answer .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein -LRB- mockingly -RRB- : I thought you had come to apologize and restore power to the Iraqis .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Iraqis ! national ;
Rumsfeld : We have nothing to apologize for , you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades .	Rumsfeld ! person ; Iraq ! country ; more ! num ;
Saddam Hussein : I know that you are ignorant of history , and I know that your president is no less ignorant but it seems that you have continued to lie to the extent that you now believe yourselves .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
If " by our neighbors " you mean the Zionist Entity then we did indeed form a danger , we were preparing to liberate our ravished territory in Palestine .	the Zionist Entity ! country ; Palestine ! country ;
This is the wish of every Arab person and not just every Iraqi .	Arab ! national ; Iraqi ! national ;
For this is Arab land and its people are Arab , and the Zionists are the ones who occupied the land and came to us from all over the world with your help , yours , and that of the old imperial powers .	Arab ! national ; Arab ! national ; Zionists ! national ;
But if you meant Kuwait , I want to ask you .	Kuwait ! country ;
Did you withdraw from Kuwait or not ?	Kuwait ! country ;
Rumsfeld : These are security issues .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Besides , there are security agreements between us and Kuwait and the other Gulf states ... we came at their request to protect them from your threats .	Kuwait ! country ; Gulf ! location ;
Saddam Hussein : Is n't funny that the wolf is being entrusted with the sheep ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
The people of Kuwait are an Arab people .	Kuwait ! country ; Arab ! national ;
And Kuwait is Iraqi territory , therefore I ask you to read history carefully , although I am certain that you wo n't comprehend it .	Kuwait ! country ; Iraqi ! national ;
Rumsfeld : Stop from this drivel , I am offering you ...	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein -LRB- interrupting -RRB- : Before you offer me your rotten goods , I ask you did you find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Iraq ! country ;
Rumsfeld -LRB- disconcerted -RRB- : We have n't found them yet , but we will surely find them one day .	Rumsfeld ! person ; one ! num ;
Do you deny that you had intentions to manufacture a nuclear bomb ?	end
Saddam Hussein : We have had no weapons of mass destruction since 1991 , we were truthful when we spoke with the international inspection mission , we were truthful in our letters to Kofi Annan , you knew these facts but you were looking for any pretext to occupy Iraq and topple its legitimate authority .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; 1991 ! date ; Kofi Annan ! person ; Iraq ! country ;
Rumsfeld : The Iraqis received us with overwhelming happiness and welcomed us , because of the practices of your bloody regime over the course of all those years in which you governed Iraq .	Rumsfeld ! person ; Iraqis ! national ; all those years ! date ; Iraq ! person ;
Saddam Hussein : Please , Mr Rumsfeld , enough lying .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Rumsfeld ! person ;
You are the ones who have opened the floodgates to cascades of blood on the soil of Iraq , you plotted against us and got some traitors to take over power over the land of the great Iraq .	Iraq ! country ; Iraq ! country ;
Rumsfeld : Those you are calling traitors have been chosen by the Iraqi people as their leaders by democratic means and free elections , something that did not take place during your rule over the country .	Rumsfeld ! person ; Iraqi ! national ;
Saddam Hussein : I found out that you had come with a troop of traitors led by Talabani -LRB- laughs mockingly -RRB- .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Talabani ! person ;
Great Iraq is being ruled by Talabani and Jaafari .	Iraq ! country ; Talabani ! person ; Jaafari ! person ;
Is n't this ridiculous ?	end
Then , which elections are you talking about ?	end
Is it permissible for what you call free elections to be held under your occupation of our country ?	end
Mr Rumsfeld , we have learned from history that the occupier will not bring except his assistants and lackeys , and you want , after all that , to convince me that the people of Iraq enjoy freedom and democracy ?	Rumsfeld ! person ; Iraq ! country ;
You are truly delusional .	end
Rumsfeld -LRB- barely able to contain his anger -RRB- : You are isolated and do not know the facts of what is happening on the outside .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
The Iraqi people have been liberated from your oppression , if they saw you or any of your men in the street they would kill you .	Iraqi ! national ;
Saddam Hussein : I challenge you to announce your location in Iraq if you can .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Iraq ! country ;
If the Iraqi resistance found out your whereabouts you would not be able to get out alive .	Iraqi ! national ;
I want to give a word of advice to your " dumb " president , you must pass it on to him , and it is that he should save what is left of his soldiers .	end
Death surrounds them everywhere and history will not be merciful to him .	end
Rumsfeld : I came to talk with you about the terrorist operations which your men are instigating and carrying out .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Your men have recently carried out an ignoble operation aimed at the Abu Ghraib prison where they injured and killed more than fifty Americans and also killed a number of prisoners imprisoned under various charges .	Abu Ghraib ! fact ; more than fifty Americans ! num ;
Your men are employing terrorists from all parts of the world and they are threatening the democratic process in Iraq .	Iraq ! country ;
Saddam Hussein : What is it you want exactly ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Rumsfeld : I am making you one offer , that you are released and choose for yourself a place of exile in any country you wish on the condition that you appear on television to announce your condemnation of the terrorism and to ask your men to stop these practices .	Rumsfeld ! person ; one ! num ;
Saddam Hussein : Have you obtained the consent of your president to this offer ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Rumsfeld : Yes , this offer was agreed to at a session in which the President , his deputy , the Secretary of State and the head of the CIA took part and I was commissioned to inform you of this offer .	Rumsfeld ! person ; CIA ! org ;
Saddam Hussein : It is a very low price .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Rumsfeld -LRB- excited -RRB- : We are prepared to include elements close to you in power .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein : And what else ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Rumsfeld : We will offer you considerable financial assistance and will look after your and your family 's security in the country you choose .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein : Do you want to hear my conditions ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Rumsfeld : Yes , that would be nice .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein -LRB- in language beaming with pride and arrogance -RRB- I want you first of all .. to set me a timetable for the withdrawal from Iraq that your government will commit itself to it in front of the world , and for you to begin the withdrawal operation immediately .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; first ! order ; Iraq ! country ;
I ask , secondly , .. for the immediate release of all the Iraqi and Arab detainees in the prisons you have set up or in those where you have shackled the freedom of tens of thousands of honorable Iraqis .	secondly ! order ; Iraqi ! national ; Arab ! national ; tens of thousands ! num ; Iraqis ! national ;

Thirdly ! order ; Iraqi ! national ; the Mother of All Battles ! thing ; 1991 ! date ; this present day ! date ;
I will accept the assistance of an international and Arab committee in estimating these losses .	Arab ! national ;
Fourthly , I ask that you produce the money which your men looted from the treasuries of Iraq and its oil especially this criminal Bremmer and his henchmen from the traitors and renegades .	Fourthly ! order ; Iraq ! country ; Bremmer ! person ;
And , fifthly , I ask for .. the return of the antiquities which you have stolen and handed over to the antiquities mafia , for these are priceless treasures because they bear the history of Iraq and its civilization .	fifthly ! order ; Iraq ! country ;
Your country is no older than a few hundred years .	a few hundred years ! date ;
True , you do not have neither a civilization nor history , but all that can not excuse your thefts and your hatred of Iraq 's civilization and Iraq 's riches .	Iraq ! country ; Iraq ! country ;
Sixthly , I ask that you hand me the weapons of mass destruction if you have found them , bring back to life all the martyrs you have killed , and return the integrity of the glorious Iraqi women which you have robbed .	Sixthly ! order ; Iraqi ! national ;
Rumsfeld : Is this some kind of joke ?	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein : No , this is just the bitter truth , which you know very well .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Mr Rumsfeld , you have committed the greatest crime in history against a peaceful Arab state .. we met each other in the eighties .	Rumsfeld ! person ; Arab ! national ; the eighties ! date ;
Do you remember your offers ?	end
Rumsfeld : Let us forget the past , we are in the process of re-evaluating our position on you and on the many forces which displayed hostility to us in the past .	Rumsfeld ! person ; the past ! date ; the past ! date ;
We have decided to hold a dialogue with the moderate Islamists .	Islamists ! national ;
We have no objection to their arrival in power via the ballot box .	end
But more importantly , we have decided to open channels of dialogue with " terrorist " organizations such as Hamas and Jihad and Hezbollah who are loyal to Iran , and other fundamentalist organizations in the whole world .	Hamas ! org ; Jihad ! org ; Hezbollah ! org ; Iran ! country ;
And we even have a project to get in touch with the Taliban movement in Afghanistan to discuss its participation in power in return for disarming .	Taliban ! org ; Afghanistan ! country ;
Saddam Hussein : Then you have begun to re-think your mistaken methodology .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Rumsfeld : It is a natural development of things , we are trying to spread democracy to all countries and all autocratic movements .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein : You would be successful if you would tell the truth .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
I know the reality of your goals .	end
If you were really sincere you would begin straightaway , you and your allies , to withdraw from Iraq , and you also have to back down from your position of supporting Israel .	Iraq ! country ; Israel ! country ;
I know that your president is stubborn and obstinate and not sincere .	end
Rumsfeld : He is a democratically elected president and not a bloodthirsty ruler like you .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
Saddam Hussein : Terrorism is your trade and deceit your method .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
Rumsfeld : This proposal is an historic chance for you .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
We will release you and will consult with you in everything concerning governance issues in Iraq .	Iraq ! country ;
If you reject this offer then the opportunity will not be repeated .	end
Saddam Hussein : I am not looking for opportunities , I am not looking for a way to save my neck from the gallows which you have set up for the whole of Iraq .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Iraq ! country ;
If I wanted that I would have accepted the Russian offer and saved my two sons and my grandson from martyrdom .	Russian ! national ; two ! num ;
I do not know what the fate of my family and my daughters and grandchildren is , but be sure that I am concerned for every Iraqi citizen and the future of the Great Iraq more than I am concerned with myself and my family .	Iraqi ! national ; Iraq ! country ;
You have previously made me an offered before this through your men that I say the weapons of mass destruction were smuggled to Syria , and you said that the price was my release .	Syria ! country ;
I refused and I repeat the refusal once again .	end
Rumsfeld : I do not want a refusal from you , I want you to think about it .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
We are currently re-evaluating our positions , we want to stop the bloodshed on both sides and so our offer is made from the point of strength and not from the point of weakness .	end
We asked Jalal Talabani to make a statement in which he denies any intention to execute you as a sign of good will from us .	Jalal Talabani ! person ;
We are ready to review our position completely on the entire political process in Iraq and we will hold a dialogue with you and with your men on this matter .	Iraq ! country ;
Saddam Hussain : Are you ready to withdraw or not ?	Saddam Hussain ! person ;
Rumsfeld : We could discuss re-deployment , our forces have prepared bases for long - term stay .	Rumsfeld ! person ;
We could withdraw from the streets and the towns but we will stay in the bases for a some time .	end

The Islam Diary : A leader of the Shiite death squads in Sadr City , east of Baghdad , acknowledged that the Mahdi Army militia was involved in killing operations of Arab Sunni men after kidnapping them , despite their relatives having paid the blood money demanded by the hostage - takers in return for their being freed .

Speaking at the same time about an Iranian role in the financing and support of the war of genocide against the Sunnis . " Fadil " , a commander in the Mahdi Army tells how he had followed three Arab Sunni men for a period of some weeks and detained them when they were crossing the Karada bridge , after having informed an Iraqi army road block close to the area that he was pursuing " terrorists " , then attacked the car of the group in question .

He also told the British Guardian that he took the three men to Sadr City where his group had interrogated them then executed them , indicating that the members of the Mahdi Army usually demanded a ransom from the families of the hostages in return for freeing their relatives , and would liquidate them anyway after they receive the ransom .	the British Guardian ! org ; three ! num ; Sadr City ! country ; the Mahdi Army ! org ;
The newspaper quoted another commander in the Mahdi Army as saying ; " We have taken 10 Sunnis hostages , we will get a ransom for five of them , then we will kill them all . In every major hostage - taking operation we get 50 thousand dollars , " and he considered it to be the best business a person could be running in Baghdad now !	the Mahdi Army ! org ; 10 Sunnis ! num ; five ! national ; 50 thousand dollars ! num ; Baghdad ! money ;
The newspaper described " Fadil " as a valuable commander to this squad because he is a Shiite who grew up in the Sunni area south of Baghdad .	Fadil ! person ; Shiite ! national ; Sunni ! national ; Baghdad ! country ;
He speaks in the Sunni dialect and carries an identity card from the Yusufiyah Sunni village .	Sunni ! national ; Yusufiyah Sunni ! country ;
He was quoted as saying : " I can enter the Sunni areas without anyone knowing that I am a Shiite . "	Sunni ! national ; Shiite ! national ;
It pointed out that Fadil and the likes are responsible for the dozens of corpses which are being found daily in Baghdad .	Fadil ! person ; dozens ! num ; Baghdad ! country ;
This means that the Baghdad security plan will not be successful unless the Americans control squads such as these to put breaks on the civil war .	Baghdad ! country ; Americans ! national ;
" Fadil " was quoted as saying that the Mahdi Army is resorting in its operations to reinforcements from Iraqi army units commanded by its members or sympathizers , and confirmed that all the police belong to the Shiite militia .	Fadil ! person ; the Mahdi Army ! org ; Iraqi ! national ; Shiite ! national ;
He added that the Mahdi Army is receiving logistic and military support from Iran and that they are not encountering any problems in getting weapons through to Sadr City because they usually present a letter to each of the checkpoints they pass through .	the Mahdi Army ! org ; Iran ! country ; Sadr City ! country ;

`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .	Ronald Watkins ! person ; Interprovincial ! org ; Interhome Energy Inc ! org ;

`` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said .	end
Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .	Canada ! country ;
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .	Canada ! country ; 30 % ! per ; a year ago ! date ; Robert Feick ! person ; Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada ! org ;
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .	Watkins ! person ; Canada ! country ;

`` It 's very much a growing concern .	end
But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he said .	end

I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings .	Lantos ! person ; HUD ! org ; Fifth Amendment ! law ;
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . ''	The Fifth Amendment ! law ;
This privilege against self - incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify .	end
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . ''	Fifth ! law ;
The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only .	end
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . ''	The Supreme Court ! org ; the Fifth Amendment ! law ;

Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .	Fifth ! law ; Fifth ! law ;
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .	Fifth ! law ;
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .	Fifth ! law ;
Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .	end
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good - faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .	Pierce ! person ; Fifth ! law ; one ! num ;
The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .	Congress ! org ; American ! national ; Pierce ! person ;
Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self - incrimination .	Fifth Amendment ! law ;

The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack .	Lemon Cheer ! product ; Japan ! country ; Attack ! product ;
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % .	Attack ! product ; 1987 ! date ; P&G ! org ; Japanese ! national ; about 8 % ! per ; more than 20 % ! per ;
With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % .	Lemon Cheer ! product ; P&G ! org ; 12 % ! per ;
While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .	Japanese ! national ; P&G ! org ; $ 4 billion U.S. ! money ;

With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry .	a cup ! measure ;
In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe .	the early 1980s ! date ; P&G ! org ; Ariel ! product ; Europe ! location ;
But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped .	Cheer ! product ; Denver ! country ;
P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .	P&G ! org ;
But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading .	P&G ! org ; Cheer ! product ;
And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space .	end
`` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says Hugh Zurkuhlen , an analyst at Salomon Bros .	Hugh Zurkuhlen ! person ; Salomon Bros ! org ;
But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case .	end
If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates .	Cheer ! product ;
Then retailers `` will probably push the -LCB- less - established -RCB- brands out altogether , '' he says .	end
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. .	Kao ! org ; Attack ! product ; U.S. ! country ;
To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market .	Kao ! org ; U.S. ! country ; P&G ! org ; about 23 % ! per ;

Of all the ethnic tensions in America , which is the most troublesome right now ?	America ! country ;
A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City .	Jews ! national ; New York City ! country ;
Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason , the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights -LRB- 9:30 - 10 p.m. EDT -RRB- .	Jackie Mason ! person ; Jewish ! national ; ABC ! org ; Tuesday nights ! date ; p.m. EDT ! time ;
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .	Mason ! person ; Chicken Soup ! art ; Duck Soup ! art ;
Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company .

Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically .	Mason ! person ; Jewish ! national ;
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically .	end
He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa .	Jews ! national ; the years ! date ;
Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language .	Mason ! person ;
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular .	the old days ! date ; the Borscht Belt ! location ; Mason ! person ;
He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''	Jews ! national ; David Dinkins ! person ; Giuliani ! person ;
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?	Mason ! person ; New Yorkers ! national ;
It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .	Mason ! person ;
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .	Mason ! person ;
For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur .	New York ! country ; NAACP ! org ; Mason ! person ;
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''	end
These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double - edged , aiming inward as well as outward .	Polish ! national ;
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .	Jews ! national ;
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .	Lenny Bruce ! person ;
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .	Jackie Mason ! person ;
Why constructive ?	end
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .	one ! num ;
That 's why it 's dangerous to have well - intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .	end
As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ''	Elizabeth Kristol ! person ; the New York Times ! org ; Mason ! person ;
The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?	Mason ! person ;
Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .	end
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue - collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . ''	Bostonians ! national ; Cheers ! art ; The Cosby Show ! art ;

Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .	Chicken Soup ! art ;
So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .	end
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues .	the didactic days ! date ; Norman Lear ! person ;
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .	end
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well - paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .	Michael ! person ; Jackie ! person ; Jewish ! national ;
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .	Mason ! person ;
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .	Mason ! person ; Jewish ! national ;
But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .	Mason ! person ;
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic - Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz .	Catholic ! national ; Carmelite ! national ; Auschwitz ! fact ;
That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .	New York City ! country ;

Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways .	Time ! org ; the second consecutive year ! date ;
In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 .	last week ! date ; Time Warner Inc.

However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher .	7.5 % ! per ; Richard Heinemann ! person ; Time ! org ;
Time is following the course of some other mass - circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .	Time ! org ; recent years ! date ;
In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp.

Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky .	Time ! org ;
`` Giveaways just give people the wrong image , '' said Mr. Heinemann .	Heinemann ! person ;
`` That perception takes the focus off the magazine . ''	end
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers .	Time ! org ;
`` What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. Heinemann .	Heinemann ! person ;
`` We are trying to create quality and involvement . ''	end
However , Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million .	Time ! org ; October 1988 ! date ; 4.6 million ! num ; 4.3 million ! num ;
And Time 's paid circulation , according to Audit Bureau of Circulations , dropped 7.3 % to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30 , 1989 .	Time ! org ; Audit Bureau of Circulations ! org ; 7.3 % ! per ; 4,393,237 ! num ; the six months ended June 30 , 1989 ! date ;

Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away .	Heinemann ! person ;
`` The question is how much are we getting from each reader , '' said Mr. Heinemann .	Heinemann ! person ;

In the second half of last year , the average growth rate of imports was 6 % to 7 % higher than that of exports .	the second half of last year ! date ; 6 % to 7 % ! per ;
