1	There 's a man on trial in New York for bombing the American embassy in Kenya two years ago .	New York ! country ; American ! national ; Kenya two years ago ! country ;
1	The FBI says when they questioned him , he told them of another plot to bomb an American ship in Yemen , where the `` USS Cole '' was ultimately attacked .	FBI ! org ; American ! national ; Yemen ! country ; the `` USS Cole '' ! product ;

1	Question two , did the Pentagon and the CIA get the message and do nothing about it ?	two ! num ; Pentagon ! org ; CIA ! org ;
1	Here 's your national correspondent , John M Wethy .	John M Wethy ! person ;
1	In the days after the bombing of the American embassy in Nairobi , Mohammed Al - owhali was arrested by Kenyan authorities and interrogated by the FBI .	American ! national ; Nairobi ! country ; Mohammed Al - owhali ! person ; Kenyan ! national ; FBI ! org ;
1	He told the FBI he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden .	FBI ! org ; Osama Bin Laden ! person ;

1	Al - owhali said it would be a rocket attack , conducted by a Bin Laden terrorist cell , and it would come in the next few months .	Al - owhali ! person ; Bin Laden ! person ;
1	The next morning , August 1998 , the FBI sent out a classified message , under Director Louis Freeh 's name , warning of a plot to attack a U.S. Navy ship in Yemen .	The next morning ! time ; August 1998 ! date ; FBI ! org ; Louis Freeh ! person ; U.S. Navy ! org ; Yemen ! country ;
1	The FBI message went to three Pentagon agencies , and as a result , the visit of one American warship to Yemen was canceled .	FBI ! org ; three Pentagon ! num ; American ! org ; Yemen ! national ;
1	The warning came as General Anthony Zinni was finalizing an agreement for refueling ships in the Yemeni port of Aden .	Anthony Zinni ! person ; Yemeni ! national ; Aden ! country ;
1	It apparently left no lasting impression .	end
1	Zinni testifying after the attack on the `` USS Cole '' -- Aden never had a specific terrorist threat .	Zinni ! person ; the `` USS Cole '' ! product ; Aden ! country ;
1	All the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats .	end
1	So what happened to the FBI warning ?	FBI ! org ;
1	CIA officials say they never received it .	CIA ! org ;
1	FBI officials say they did copy the CIA .	FBI ! org ; CIA ! org ;
1	Pentagon officials say they got the warning , but had no idea the source was such a well - connected insider within Bin Laden 's organization .	Pentagon ! org ; Bin Laden 's ! person ;

1	Is the investor today in your judgment secure ?	today ! date ;
1	Well , I think that the marketplace is becoming increasingly secure .	end
1	I think a number of the reforms that have come via the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and a number of things that we have done at the SEC are basically making everybody take a new look at how they 're performing their duty as a director , how they 're performing their duties on audit committees and compensation committees and in Wall Street .	the Sarbanes - Oxley Act ! law ; SEC ! org ; Wall Street ! org ;
1	I think the reforms that came as a part of the large settlement are going to change the way research and investment banking are done to the betterment of the individual investor .	end
1	And some people are surprised and I might even add pleased in this city that your SEC has been quick to react when Phil Purcell of Morgan Stanley made a statement that your SEC did n't think and that you did n't think expressed appropriate contrition when Bear Stearns stepped out of line in the view of the SEC .

1	You have also expressed concern about excessive executive compensation , particularly CEO compensation .	end
1	Is there really anything that can be done about this problem ?	end
1	I think so , Lou .	Lou ! person ;
1	I think the real next step here is for compensation committees to spend a little more time than they do on what they 're really compensating for .	end
1	I think there 's been too much emphasis on performance defined strictly by stock performance and earnings per share .	end
1	I think there are a number of other measures that indicate how well somebody 's doing running a company , and I think corporation boards need to spend more time on that dimension .	end

1	Maybe before the weapon and then later he said , Oh , I should have got the nuclear weapon before I invaded .	end
1	He was right about that , but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen - years war where the United States could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in `91 when it could have been finished .	dozen - years ! date ; the United States ! country ; `91 ! date ;

1	uh-huh .	end
1	And he just keeps forgetting .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	But o-	end
1	How 's he doing ?	end
1	Much better .	end
1	yeah ?	end
1	yeah .	end
1	he 's often chipper .	end
1	He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen .	this morning at five seventeen ! time ;
1	Pe-	end
1	oh my god .	end
1	Is that because he 's not sleeping and	end
1	Well because he could n't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom .	end
1	oh .	end
1	So I think it 's time to give all the cats a bath .	end
1	%mm .	end
1	yeah	end
1	and the- ,	end
1	you should do that .	end
1	I know .	end
1	It 's a two person job though .	two ! num ;
1	I 'll have to get somebody to help me .	end
1	%mm . yeah .	end
1	%hm .	end
1	But %uh , yeah ,	end
1	it 's still a fairly expensive call	end
1	%uh but it 's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it ,	end
1	then it	end
1	the Dutch have such high taxes on those	Dutch ! national ;
1	they consider it a luxury to call around the world	end
1	so they tax it really high .	end
1	Anyway %um	end
1	So you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth	the eighteenth ! date ; the nineteenth ! date ;
1	and you 're going to go to %uh Amsterdam .	Amsterdam ! country ;
1	Well I would say is once you 're at a hotel uh-huh %um , why do n't you call me at work and let me know where you are ,	end
1	and then we can make arrangements that day %um , that I can meet you in Amsterdam .	Amsterdam ! country ;
1	And maybe I 'll come by , public transport .	end
1	It 's probably easier for me to come by public transport in Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest .	Amsterdam ! country ;
1	mhm .	end
1	The streets are small	end
1	and there 's no parking .	end
1	So I probably will come by public transport	end
1	but I do n't know .	end
1	We 'll see where you 're staying	end
1	%um	end
1	and there 's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff	end
1	you can see stuff in Amsterdam	Amsterdam ! country ;
1	and %uh since the days are really long ,	end
1	I mean it stays light here till about ten thirty eleven o'clock mhm . at night .	ten thirty eleven o'clock ! time ; at night ! time ;
1	So if you want we can take a ride and go see stuff at night	at night ! time ;
1	and I can take you to some places ,	end
1	we can %uh go see some stuff .	end
1	%um , depends on what you guys want to see .	end
1	So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know .	end
1	okay	end
1	%um and I 'll sit and talk with Anya about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see .	Anya ! person ;
1	So if you do n't have any ideas we 'll just put something together for you .	end
1	okay .	end
1	%um but yeah	end
1	but I can pick you up th- ,	end
1	you know I 'll probably be there some time around six	around six ! time ;
1	and we can like do a quick dinner or something yeah and go see whatever you want to see ,	end
1	if you want to stay in Amsterdam that 's fine .	Amsterdam ! country ;
1	If you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of , echte Holland , real Holland and we can do that too .	Holland ! country ; Holland ! country ;
1	Actually I 've been up to Holland before .	Holland ! country ;
1	Spent about two weeks up there .	about two weeks ! date ;
1	yeah .	end
1	So %um ,	end
1	but that was years and years ago .	years and years ago ! date ;
1	With your parents when your father was stationed over here , right ?	end
1	yeah .	end
1	But we got to see Den Haag and places like that too which we 're obviously not going to see this time .	Den Haag ! country ;
1	But %um	end
1	has Kim been here before ?	Kim ! person ;
1	And , an-	end
1	No .	end
1	oh good .	end
1	But then again I 'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things .	Kim ! person ; Shape Headquarters ! fact ;
1	Would you be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters again .	Shape Headquarters ! fact ;
1	No . Not really .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	I did n't think so .	end
1	Somehow I had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you .	end
1	yep .	end
1	I 'm ,	end
1	the mil- ,	end
1	I ca n't say too bad things about the military though .	end
1	They still have my goods	end
1	and they 'll probably hold them hostage .	end
1	And they own my body and soul for like another four years	another four years ! date ;
1	so I just got to pray that they	end
1	oh do they ?	end
1	yeah .	end
1	I owe four years in active reserve time .	four years ! date ;
1	aw great .	end
1	Do they do that to everyone ?	end
1	Milo , get out of there	end
1	yeah -- -- %eh everyone %uh who has n't been like you were	end
1	you went through like the thirty six two process .	thirty six two ! num ;
1	mhm .	end
1	So you do n't have it	end
1	but yeah if you just separate normally and you have n't served at least eight years , then you owe it .	at least eight years ! date ;
1	And that 's one of those things they just never tell you up front .	end
1	No .	end
1	They never said anything	end
1	I figured there was something like that because	end
1	And I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too .	end
1	So .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	I mean that 's the military .	end
1	I have my discharge papers and everything	end
1	uh-huh .	end
1	and I 've said that yeah I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they call me back for those , but they 're going to have to pay my trip back to the states . because there 's no bases in Holland and I 'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them .	the states ! country ; Holland ! country ; Germany ! country ;
1	If they want me they can pay ,	end
1	bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they 're going to drag me off somewhere .	end
1	But %uh , first they have to find me .	first ! order ;
1	yeah , that 's the other	end
1	it was i- ,	end
1	if you 're in another country I mean and you 're not planning on coming back to the U S what are they going to do even if you do n't .	the U S ! country ;
1	yeah .	end
1	Well I mean I 'm still American citizen	American ! national ;
1	and I still would like to be welcome in my own country .	end
1	Although g-	end
1	%uh I mean if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably would n't be a horror either ,	end
1	but %uh yeah	end
1	right now I mean I do want to keep my American citizenship	American ! national ;
1	so .	end
1	I kind of want to	end
1	Are you going to become a dual citizen ?	end
1	What 's that ?	end
1	Are you going to try and become a dual citizen ?	end
1	Have dual citizenship ?	end
1	You ca n't do that ,	end
1	%um , the only way to be a dual citizen is if you 're born in a foreign country	end
1	like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .	Holland ! country ; American ! national ;
1	But you ca n't	end
1	If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my American citizenship .	Holland ! country ; American ! national ;
1	As far as the Americans are concerned , yeah .	Americans ! national ;
1	yeah .	end
1	The Dutch could care less .	Dutch ! national ;
1	The Dutch would say fine	Dutch ! national ;
1	want to be a dual citizen ,	end
1	that 's fine ,	end
1	but the Americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship .	Americans ! national ; American ! national ;
1	I mean it 's kind of stupid .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	So I 'm an expatriot .	end
1	An American expatriot .	American ! national ;
1	An American living abroad .	American ! national ;
1	I still have to file a tax return .	end
1	Do you ?	end
1	yeah .	end
1	But my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free .	first seventy five thousand dollars ! order ;
1	Good grief .	end
1	As long as I do n't bring it back to the states .	end
1	Good grief .	end
1	I R S for you , %huh ?	I R S ! org ;
1	yeah .	end
1	oh they want their share .	end
1	They want their piece of meat .	end
1	But all foreign taxes are deductible ,	end
1	and my taxes here are fifty percent of income .	fifty percent ! per ;
1	So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it .	end
1	Unless you became C E O of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable , right ?	a thousand dollars ! money ;
1	yeah .	end
1	Somehow it raises a small amount .	end
1	the problem 's going to %uh be Anya 's American salary is taxable here and at fifty percent	Anya ! person ; American ! national ; fifty percent ! per ;
1	so we 're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary .	the Dutch government ! org ;
1	aw .	end
1	Some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount	end
1	and the amount we pay the American government is deductible ,	the American government ! org ;
1	but we 'll still owe some taxes .	end
1	Th- ,	end
1	see I do n't know how it works .	end
1	we 're going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue how that all works .	end
1	They do n't have the Quicken Dutch version ?	Quicken Dutch ! product ;
1	yeah .	end
1	%ah , you know I would n't trust it because it 's so complicated with this international garbage or else the Turbo Tax with the Dutch modules . that I just would n't trust it .	the Turbo Tax ! product ; Dutch ! language ;
1	I do n't know , %eh .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	So complicated when you 're dealing with a Dutch tax form .	Dutch ! language ;
1	Anya had to read it	Anya ! person ;
1	and Anya and her father did n't understand the damn thing .	Anya ! person ;
1	How am I supposed to understand it ?	end
1	I 'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with ,	Oregon ! country ;
1	Oregon you pay state tax	Oregon ! country ;
1	Washington you do n't .	Washington ! country ;
1	I 'm looking forward to that cause %uh	end
1	yeah	end
1	but You 'll be a student	end
1	so you ,	end
1	I mean you 're	end
1	what is your income ?	end
1	oh , well	end
1	See I think y- , %um ,	end
1	it 'll probably be about five thousand dollars the portion of this year that I 'm in Oregon	about five thousand dollars the portion of this year ! money ; Oregon ! date ;
1	and then next year it 'll be eleven thousand .	next year ! date ; eleven thousand ! num ;
1	yeah .	end
1	But I mean you 're below the poverty line at that level .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	So I mean any income that y-	end
1	Well	end
1	But then I 've already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in Washington	like fifteen thousand ! num ; Washington ! country ;
1	but	end
1	That should be non taxable out of state income .	end
1	It should	end
1	but you know it 's not going to be a fun tax return year .	year ! date ;
1	I had that when I went into the military .	end
1	But then again .	end
1	I had Kans- ,	end
1	I had to file three taxes .	three ! num ;
1	I had to file Georgia , Kansas yeah and then my federal .	Georgia ! country ; Kansas ! country ;
1	So .	end
1	Well , %um actually I think this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only half an hour ,	half an hour ! time ;
1	but %um	end
1	So let 's see .	end
1	I 'll give you a call when we arrive in h- ,	end
1	or maybe I 'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we 're there ,	Holland ! country ;
1	so if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then call you back %um when we get to a hotel or something like that .	the eighteenth ! date ; the nineteenth ! date ;
1	okay that 's a great idea .	end
1	as soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled you can call me	Holland ! country ;
1	and %uh if it 's at night , just call Anya 's parents	night ! time ; Anya ! person ;
1	okay so	end
1	and remember that if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero	Holland ! country ; zero ! num ;
1	so like right now okay it 's one eight one zero area code .	one eight one zero ! num ;
1	If you dial in Holland , it 's zero one eight one zero . okay in Holland	Holland ! country ; zero one eight one zero ! num ; Holland ! num ;
1	and then yeah you can just call up	end
1	if it 's during the work hours , fine , call me at work .	the work hours ! time ;
1	If not , call Anya 's parents if you do n't have a new phone number for me .	Anya ! person ;
1	And if you do , I 'll send it by email okay if I get it before this weekend	before this weekend ! date ;
1	we 'll email you something	end
1	but if you do n't get email then just call Anya 's parents	Anya ! person ;
1	If we have a phone by then , they 'll be able to give you the number	end
1	okay	end
1	and just remember to ask for her mother .	end
1	and it 's Goode , right	Goode ! person ;
1	Bode	Bode ! person ;
1	Bode	Bode ! person ;
1	Bode as in abode	Bode ! person ;
1	abode	end
1	minus the A	end
1	okay	end
1	great	end

1	yeah	end

1	%uh %ah %uh It 's Mifrau	end
1	is	end
1	it 's Frau in German	German ! language ;
1	it 's Frau	end
1	mhm	end

1	I 'll probably never remember that	end
1	so hope they wo n't be offended .	end
1	nah do n't worry about it .	end
1	You can just call her Missus	end
1	you can just call her Missus and speak English to her .	English ! language ;
1	she understands	end
1	just talk slowly and clearly .	end
1	okay	end
1	and once you 're in Holland the line will be really clear .	Holland ! country ;
1	I mean the phones here are pretty good . once you 're in the country .	end
1	It 's just these to America	America ! country ;
1	it 's always kind of iffy	end
1	So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?	end
1	Things are going very well .	end
1	I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss .	Guss ! person ;
1	oh .	end
1	And that %um	end
1	No , you had n't mentioned that .	end
1	%eh , oh , okay .	end
1	okay , so %um	end
1	%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,	end
1	and you were entertaining offers .	end
1	And , %uh	end
1	well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts .	end
1	%um oh . So things are going extremely well .	end
1	So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount .	end
1	You know , he , %uh ,	end
1	there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then	the next two three years ! date ;
1	so I decided that it would make sense to do this .	end
1	%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then .	end
1	%mm .	end
1	So I 'm quite pleased .	end
1	Well that 's good .	end
1	%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year .	this year ! date ;
1	I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .	end
1	But , %uh , it should come out this year .	this year ! date ;
1	oh , well that 's good .	end
1	It should be done in a few months .	a few months ! date ;
1	oh , yeah	end
1	I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .	end
1	yeah ,	end
1	yeah .	end
1	So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?	end
1	%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .	end
1	%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .	end
1	But %ah well . I am working on that one .	end
1	%uh .	end
1	It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .	end
1	oh , harsh . Harsh .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	yeah ,	end
1	and .	end
1	Not a whole lot I can do about that now .	end
1	Indeed . Indeed .	end
1	have to deal with the situation .	end
1	And	end
1	So that 's what I 'm doing .	end
1	Sounds good .	end
1	But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work .	One ! num ;
1	I 've actually been doing a lot of it .	end
1	oh wow .	end
1	And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,	May ! date ;
1	and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it .	end
1	yeah ,	end
1	actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .	one ! num ; one ! num ;
1	You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .	France ! country ; a year and a half ! date ;
1	yeah .	end
1	And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	yup ,	end
1	yup .	end
1	But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .	one ! num ;
1	mhm .	end
1	And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,	one ! num ;
1	but none of the other models %uh , had ?	end
1	Yes .	end
1	the- ,	end
1	I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .	end
1	And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .	one ! num ;
1	Yes .	end
1	okay .	end
1	if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .	more than one ! num ;
1	okay .	end
1	So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .	end
1	And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,	end
1	but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .	end
1	You ca n't find so that it will sustain .	end
1	okay .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .	end
1	And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .	end
1	%hm .	end
1	The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .	end
1	Got it ,	end
1	got it .	end
1	I see .	end
1	So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .	end
1	But yeah . it gives a driving term .	end
1	oh , okay .	end
1	So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .	end
1	Exactly .	end
1	oh wow .	end
1	so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .	end
1	But	end
1	which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .	end
1	%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But	end
1	so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?	Nature ! org ;
1	%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,	end
1	I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .	Optics Letters ! org ; Phys Rev Letters ! org ;
1	%hm .	end
1	But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .	a couple ! num ;
1	yeah .	end
1	%hm . impressive .	end
1	And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,	end
1	but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .	end
1	oh , okay .	end
1	oh , I did n't realize that .	end
1	okay .	end
1	yeah ,	end
1	so that 's why it 's actually a big deal is	end
1	I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics	end
1	and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .	end
1	And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .	Neil ! person ;
1	And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,	Neil ! person ;
1	and it 's true	end
1	they do in the transients	end
1	And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .	end
1	And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,	Neil ! person ; Rochester ! country ;
1	yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .	end
1	oh cool .	end
1	and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr	Neil ! person ; second ! time ; a week later ! date ; Bryn Mawr ! org ;
1	and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .	Lowell ! person ;
1	Exactly .	end
1	And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .	Neil ! person ;
1	Indeed .	end
1	So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um	end
1	Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .	end
1	so you might as well spend the time .	end
1	Yes , well ,	end
1	%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,	end
1	and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .	end
1	So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	yeah , okay .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	I mean the thing that i-	end
1	this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to .	end
1	oh .	end
1	It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that was easy ,	end
1	it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .	end
1	Exactly .	end
1	Exactly .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	And unfortunately .	end
1	Well , it 's kind of odd .	end
1	They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .	end
1	%hm .	end
1	as far	end
1	yeah	end
1	as a .	end
1	The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,	first ! order ;
1	mostly worthless stuff .	end
1	And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,	end
1	it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless .	end
1	%huh .	end
1	So .	end
1	That 's bizarre . Bizarre .	end
1	so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ?	second ! order ;
1	Actually , no ,	end
1	all they stole the second time was my bike .	second ! order ;
1	%huh .	end
1	Which was actually where the major problem came . Exactly . Exactly . yeah . Is that I suddenly had no transportation .	end
1	And so , I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike ,	end
1	and %mm . that cost me a lot of time .	end
1	yeah .	end
1	Exactly .	end
1	Because ,	end
1	yes	end
1	Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes , and nah well . then getting one purchased , and then having to , you know , go get it and things like that .	one ! num ;

1	Jesus called his twelve apostles together .	end
1	He gave them power to heal sicknesses and power to force demons out of people .	end
1	He sent them to tell about God 's kingdom and to heal the sick .	end
1	He said to them , `` When you travel , do n't take a walking stick .	end
1	Also , do n't carry a bag , food , or money .	end
1	Take for your trip only the clothes you are wearing .	end
1	When you go into a house , stay there until it is time to leave .	end
1	If the people in the town will not welcome you , go outside the town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . ''	end
1	So the apostles went out .	end
1	They traveled through all the towns .	end
1	They told the Good News and healed people everywhere .	end
1	Herod the ruler heard about all these things that were happening .	end
1	He was confused because some people said , `` John the Baptizer has risen from death . ''	end
1	Others said , `` Elijah has come to us . ''	end
1	And some others said , `` One of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . ''	end
1	Herod said , `` I cut off John 's head .	end
1	So who is this man I hear these things about ? ''	end
1	Herod continued trying to see Jesus .	end
1	When the apostles came back , they told Jesus what they had done on their trip .	end
1	Then he took them away to a town called Bethsaida .	end
1	There , he and his apostles could be alone together .	end
1	But the people learned where Jesus went and followed him .	end
1	He welcomed them and talked with them about God 's kingdom .	end
1	He healed the people who were sick .	end
1	Late in the afternoon , the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said , `` No one lives in this place .	end
1	Send the people away .	end
1	They need to find food and places to sleep in the farms and towns around here . ''	end
1	But Jesus said to the apostles , `` You give them something to eat . ''	end
1	They said , `` We have only five loaves of bread and two fish .	end
1	Do you want us to go buy food for all these people ? ''	end
1	There are too many !	end
1	-LRB- There were about 5000 men there . -RRB-	end
1	Jesus said to his followers , `` Tell the people to sit in groups of about 50 people . ''	end
1	So the followers did this and everyone sat down .	end
1	Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish .	end
1	He looked up into the sky and thanked God for the food .	end
1	Then he broke it into pieces , which he gave to the followers to give to the people .	end
1	They all ate until they were full .	end
1	And there was a lot of food left .	end
1	Twelve baskets were filled with the pieces of food that were not eaten .	end
1	One time Jesus was praying alone .	end
1	His followers came together there , and he asked them , `` Who do the people say I am ? ''	end
1	They answered , `` Some people say you are John the Baptizer .	end
1	Others say you are Elijah .	end
1	And some people say you are one of the prophets from long ago that has come back to life . ''	end
1	Then Jesus said to his followers , `` And who do you say I am ? ''	end
1	Peter answered , `` You are the Christ from God . ''	end
1	Jesus warned them not to tell anyone .	end
1	Then Jesus said , `` The Son of Man must suffer many things .	end
1	He will be rejected by the older Jewish leaders , the leading priests , and teachers of the law .	end
1	And he will be killed .	end
1	But after three days he will be raised from death . ''	end
1	Jesus continued to say to all of them , `` Any of you who want to be my follower must stop thinking about yourself and what you want .	end
1	You must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you every day for following me .	end
1	Any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it .	end
1	But you who give up your life for me will save it .	end
1	It is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost .	end
1	Do n't be ashamed of me and my teaching .	end
1	If that happens , I will be ashamed of you when I come with my divine greatness and that of the Father and the holy angels .	end
1	Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom before you die . ''	end
1	About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James and went up on a mountain to pray .	end
1	While Jesus was praying , his face began to change .	end
1	His clothes became shining white .	end
1	Then two men were there , talking with him .	end
1	They were Moses and Elijah .	end
1	They also looked bright and glorious .	end
1	They were talking with Jesus about his death that would happen in Jerusalem .	end
1	Peter and the others were asleep .	end
1	But they woke up and saw the glory of Jesus .	end
1	They also saw the two men who were standing with him .	end
1	When Moses and Elijah were leaving , Peter said , ``	end
1	Master , it is good that we are here .	end
1	We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''	end
1	-LRB- He did not know what he was saying . -RRB-	end
1	While Peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them .	end
1	Peter , John , and James were afraid when the cloud covered them .	end
1	A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son .	end
1	He is the one I have chosen .	end
1	Obey him . ''	end
1	When the voice stopped , only Jesus was there .	end
1	Peter , John , and James said nothing .	end
1	And for a long time after that , they told no one about what they had seen .	end
1	The next day , Jesus , Peter , John , and James came down from the mountain .	end
1	A large group of people met Jesus .	end
1	A man in the group shouted to him , `` Teacher , please come and look at my son .	end
1	He is the only child I have .	end
1	An evil spirit comes into him , and then he shouts .	end
1	He loses control of himself and foams at the mouth .	end
1	The evil spirit continues to hurt him and almost never leaves him .	end
1	I begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son , but they could not do it . ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` You people today have no faith .	end
1	Your lives are all wrong .	end
1	How long must I be with you and be patient with you ? ''	end
1	Then Jesus said to the man , `` Bring your son here . ''	end
1	While the boy was coming , the demon threw the boy to the ground .	end
1	The boy lost control of himself .	end
1	But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit .	end
1	Then the boy was healed , and Jesus gave him back to his father .	end
1	All the people were amazed at the great power of God .	end
1	The people were still amazed about all the things Jesus did .	end
1	He said to his followers , `` Do n't forget what I will tell you now : The Son of Man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . ''	end
1	But the followers did not understand what he meant .	end
1	The meaning was hidden from them so that they could not understand it .	end
1	But they were afraid to ask Jesus about what he said .	end
1	Jesus ' followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .	end
1	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him .	end
1	Then he said to the followers , `` Whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me .	end
1	And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me .	end
1	The one among you who is the most humble -- this is the one who is great . ''	end
1	John answered , `` Master , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people .	end
1	We told him to stop because he does not belong to our group . ''	end
1	Jesus said to him , `` Do n't stop him .	end
1	Whoever is not against you is for you . ''	end
1	The time was coming near when Jesus would leave and go back to heaven .	end
1	He decided to go to Jerusalem .	end
1	He sent some men ahead of him .	end
1	They went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him .	end
1	But the people there would not welcome Jesus because he was going toward Jerusalem .	end
1	James and John , the followers of Jesus , saw this .	end
1	They said , `` Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people ? ''	end
1	But Jesus turned and criticized them for saying this .	end
1	Then he and his followers went to another town .	end
1	They were all traveling along the road .	end
1	Someone said to Jesus , `` I will follow you anywhere you go . ''	end
1	He answered , `` The foxes have holes to live in .	end
1	The birds have nests .	end
1	But the Son of Man has no place where he can rest his head . ''	end
1	Jesus said to another man , `` Follow me ! ''	end
1	But the man said , `` Lord , let me go and bury my father first . ''	end
1	But Jesus said to him , `` Let the people who are dead bury their own dead .	end
1	You must go and tell about God 's kingdom . ''	end
1	Another man said , `` I will follow you , Lord , but first let me go and say goodbye to my family . ''	end
1	Jesus said , `` Anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for God 's kingdom . ''	end
1	Jesus was going through the city of Jericho .	end
1	In Jericho there was a man named Zacchaeus .	end
1	He was a wealthy , very important tax collector .	end
1	He wanted to see who Jesus was .	end
1	There were many others who wanted to see Jesus too .	end
1	Zacchaeus was too short to see above the people .	end
1	So he ran to a place where he knew Jesus would come .	end
1	Then he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .	end
1	When Jesus came to where Zacchaeus was , he looked up and saw him in the tree .	end
1	Jesus said , `` Zacchaeus , hurry !	end
1	Come down !	end
1	I must stay at your house today . ''	end
1	Zacchaeus hurried and came down .	end
1	He was happy to have Jesus in his house .	end
1	Everyone saw this .	end
1	They began to complain , `` Look at the kind of man Jesus is staying with .	end
1	Zacchaeus is a sinner ! ''	end
1	Zacchaeus said to the Lord , `` I want to do good .	end
1	I will give half of my money to the poor .	end
1	If I have cheated anyone , I will pay them back four times more . ''	end
1	Jesus said , `` Today is the day for this family to be saved from sin .	end
1	Yes , even this tax collector is one of God 's chosen people .	end
1	The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them . ''	end
1	As the crowd listened to what he was saying , Jesus went on to tell a story .	end
1	He was now near Jerusalem and knew that the people thought it was almost time for God 's kingdom to come .	end
1	So he said , `` A very important man was preparing to go to a country far away to be made a king .	end
1	Then he planned to return home and rule his people .	end
1	So he called ten of his servants together .	end
1	He gave a bag of money to each servant .	end
1	He said , ' Do business with this money until I come back . '	end
1	But the people in the kingdom hated the man .	end
1	They sent a group to follow him to the other country .	end
1	There they said , ' We do n't want this man to be our king . '	end
1	`` But the man was made king .	end
1	When he came home , he said , ' Call those servants who have my money .	end
1	I want to know how much more money they earned with it . '	end
1	The first servant came and said , ' Sir , I earned ten bags of money with the one bag you gave me . '	end
1	The king said to him , ' That 's great !	end
1	You are a good servant .	end
1	I see that I can trust you with small things .	end
1	So now I will let you rule over ten of my cities . '	end
1	`` The second servant said , ' Sir , with your one bag of money I earned five bags . '	end
1	The king said to this servant , ' You can rule over five cities . '	end
1	`` Then another servant came in and said to the king , ' Sir , here is your bag of money .	end
1	I wrapped it in a piece of cloth and hid it .	end
1	I was afraid of you because you are a hard man .	end
1	You even take money that you did n't earn and gather food that you did n't grow . '	end
1	`` Then the king said to him , ' What a bad servant you are !	end
1	I will use your own words to condemn you .	end
1	You said that I am a hard man .	end
1	You said that I even take money that I did n't earn and gather food that I did n't grow .	end
1	If that is true , you should have put my money in the bank .	end
1	Then , when I came back , my money would have earned some interest . '	end
1	Then the king said to the men who were watching , ' Take the bag of money away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten bags of money . '	end
1	`` The men said to the king , ' But sir , that servant already has ten bags of money . '	end
1	`` The king said , ' People who use what they have will get more .	end
1	But those who do not use what they have will have everything taken away from them .	end
1	Now where are my enemies ?	end
1	Where are the people who did not want me to be king ?	end
1	Bring my enemies here and kill them .	end
1	I will watch them die . ' ''	end
1	After Jesus said these things , he continued traveling toward Jerusalem .	end
1	He came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives .	end
1	He sent out two of his followers .	end
1	He said , `` Go into the town you can see there .	end
1	When you enter the town , you will find a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden .	end
1	Untie it , and bring it here to me .	end
1	If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , you should say , ' The Master needs it . ' ''	end
1	The two followers went into town .	end
1	They found the donkey exactly like Jesus told them .	end
1	They untied it , but its owners came out .	end
1	They said to the followers , `` Why are you untying our donkey ? ''	end
1	The followers answered , `` The Master needs it . ''	end
1	So the followers brought the donkey to Jesus .	end
1	They put their coats on its back .	end
1	Then they put Jesus on the donkey .	end
1	He rode along the road toward Jerusalem .	end
1	The followers spread their coats on the road before him .	end
1	Jesus was coming close to Jerusalem .	end
1	He was already near the bottom of the Mount of Olives .	end
1	The whole group of followers was happy .	end
1	They were very excited and praised God .	end
1	They thanked God for all the powerful things they had seen .	end
1	They said , `` ' Welcome !	end
1	God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord . '	end
1	Peace in heaven and glory to God ! ''	end
1	Some of the Pharisees said to Jesus , `` Teacher , tell your followers not to say these things . ''	end
1	But Jesus answered , `` I tell you , if my followers did n't say them , these stones would shout them . ''	end
1	Jesus came near Jerusalem .	end
1	Looking at the city , he began to cry for it and said , `` I wish you knew today what would bring you peace .	end
1	But it is hidden from you now .	end
1	A time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides .	end
1	They will destroy you and all your people .	end
1	Not one stone of your buildings will stay on top of another .	end
1	All this will happen because you did not know the time when God came to save you . ''	end
1	Jesus went into the Temple area .	end
1	He began to throw out the people who were selling things there .	end
1	He said , `` The Scriptures say , ' My Temple will be a house of prayer . '	end
1	But you have changed it into a ' hiding place for thieves . ' ''	end
1	Jesus taught the people in the Temple area every day .	end
1	The leading priests , the teachers of the law , and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill him .	end
1	But they did not know how they could do it , because everyone was listening to him .	end
1	The people were very interested in what Jesus said .	end
1	I really do n't need to write to you about this help for God 's people .	end
1	I know that you want to help .	end
1	I have been bragging about you to the people in Macedonia .	end
1	I told them that you people in Achaia have been ready to give since last year .	end
1	And your desire to give has made most of the people here ready to give also .	end
1	But I am sending the brothers to you .	end
1	I do n't want our bragging about you in this to be for nothing .	end
1	I want you to be ready just as I said you would be .	end
1	If any of those from Macedonia come with me , and they find that you are not ready , we will be ashamed .	end
1	We will be ashamed that we were so sure of you .	end
1	And you will be ashamed too !	end
1	So I thought that I should ask these brothers to come there before we do .	end
1	They will help in getting together the generous gift you promised .	end
1	Then it will be ready when we come , and it will be seen as a blessing you are giving , not as something you were forced to do .	end
1	Remember this : The one who plants few seeds will have a small harvest .	end
1	But the one who plants a lot will have a big harvest .	end
1	Each one of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give .	end
1	You should not give if it makes you unhappy or if you feel forced to give .	end
1	God loves those who are happy to give .	end
1	And God can give you more blessings than you need , and you will always have plenty of everything .	end
1	You will have enough to give to every good work .	end
1	As the Scriptures say , `` He gives generously to the poor ; his goodness will continue forever . ''	end
1	God is the one who gives seed to those who plant , and he gives bread for food .	end
1	And God will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow .	end
1	He will produce a great harvest from your goodness .	end
1	God will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely .	end
1	And your giving through us will make people give thanks to God .	end
1	The service you are offering helps God 's people with their needs , but that is not all it does .	end
1	It is also bringing more and more thanks to God .	end
1	This service is a proof of your faith , and people will praise God because of it .	end
1	They will praise him because you are following the message about Christ -- the message you say you believe .	end
1	They will praise God because you freely share with them and with all people .	end
1	And when they pray , they will wish they could be with you .	end
1	They will feel this way because of the great grace that God gave you .	end
1	Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful to describe .	end
1	While Apollos was in the city of Corinth , Paul was visiting some places on his way to Ephesus .	end
1	In Ephesus he found some other followers of the Lord .	end
1	He asked them , `` Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ''	end
1	These followers said to him , `` We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit ! ''	end
1	Paul asked them , `` So what kind of baptism did you have ? ''	end
1	They said , `` It was the baptism that John taught . ''	end
1	Paul said , `` John told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives .	end
1	He told people to believe in the one who would come after him , and that one is Jesus . ''	end
1	When these followers heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .	end
1	Then Paul laid his hands on them , and the Holy Spirit came on them .	end
1	They began speaking different languages and prophesying .	end
1	There were about twelve men in this group .	end
1	Paul went into the synagogue and spoke very boldly .	end
1	He continued doing this for three months .	end
1	He talked with the Jews , trying to persuade them to accept what he was telling them about God 's kingdom .	end
1	But some of them became stubborn and refused to believe .	end
1	In front of everyone , they said bad things about the Way .	end
1	So Paul left these Jews and took the Lord 's followers with him .	end
1	He went to a place where a man named Tyrannus had a school .	end
1	There Paul talked with people every day .	end
1	He did this for two years .	end
1	Because of this work , everyone in Asia , Jews and Greeks , heard the word of the Lord .	end
1	God used Paul to do some very special miracles .	end
1	Some people carried away handkerchiefs and clothes that Paul had used and put them on those who were sick .	end
1	The sick people were healed , and evil spirits left them .	end
1	Some Jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people .	end
1	The seven sons of Sceva , one of the leading priests , were doing this .	end
1	These Jews tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to make the evil spirits go out of people .	end
1	They all said , `` By the same Jesus that Paul talks about , I order you to come out ! ''	end
1	But one time an evil spirit said to these Jews , `` I know Jesus , and I know about Paul , but who are you ? ''	end
1	Then the man who had the evil spirit inside him jumped on these Jews .	end
1	He was much stronger than all of them .	end
1	He beat them up and tore their clothes off .	end
1	They all ran away from that house .	end
1	All the people in Ephesus , Jews and Greeks , learned about this .	end
1	They were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the Lord Jesus .	end
1	Many of the believers began to confess , telling about all the evil things they had done .	end
1	Some of them had used magic .	end
1	These believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone .	end
1	These books were worth about 50 , 000 silver coins .	end
1	This is how the word of the Lord was spreading in a powerful way , causing more and more people to believe .	end
1	After this , Paul made plans to go to Jerusalem .	end
1	He planned to go through the regions of Macedonia and Achaia , and then go to Jerusalem .	end
1	He thought , `` After I visit Jerusalem , I must also visit Rome . ''	end
1	Timothy and Erastus were two of his helpers .	end
1	Paul sent them ahead to Macedonia .	end
1	But he stayed in Asia for a while .	end
1	But during that time there was some trouble in Ephesus about the Way .	end
1	This is how it all happened : There was a man named Demetrius .	end
1	He worked with silver .	end
1	He made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess Artemis .	end
1	The men who did this work made a lot of money .	end
1	Demetrius had a meeting with these men and some others who did the same kind of work .	end
1	He told them , `` Men , you know that we make a lot of money from our business .	end
1	But look at what this man Paul is doing .	end
1	Listen to what he is saying .	end
1	He has convinced many people in Ephesus and all over Asia to change their religion .	end
1	He says the gods that people make by hand are not real .	end
1	I 'm afraid this is going to turn people against our business .	end
1	But there is also another problem .	end
1	People will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is not important .	end
1	Her greatness will be destroyed .	end
1	And Artemis is the goddess that everyone in Asia and the whole world worships . ''	end
1	When the men heard this , they became very angry .	end
1	They shouted , `` Great is Artemis , the goddess of Ephesus ! ''	end
1	The whole city was thrown into confusion .	end
1	The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , men from Macedonia who were traveling with Paul , and rushed all together into the stadium .	end
1	Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the Lord 's followers did not let him go .	end
1	Also , some leaders of the country who were friends of Paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium .	end
1	Some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else .	end
1	The meeting was very confused .	end
1	Most of the people did not know why they had come there .	end
1	Some Jews made a man named Alexander stand before the crowd , and they told him what to say .	end
1	Alexander waved his hand , trying to explain things to the people .	end
1	But when the people saw that Alexander was a Jew , they all began shouting the same thing .	end
1	For two hours they continued shouting , `` Great is Artemis of Ephesus !	end
1	Great is Artemis of Ephesus !	end
1	Great is Artemis . . . ! ''	end
1	Then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet .	end
1	He said , `` Men of Ephesus , everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis .	end
1	Everyone knows that we also keep her holy rock .	end
1	No one can deny this , so you should be quiet .	end
1	You must stop and think before you do anything else .	end
1	`` You brought these men here , but they have not said anything bad against our goddess .	end
1	They have not stolen anything from her temple .	end
1	We have courts of law and there are judges .	end
1	Do Demetrius and those men who work with him have a charge against anyone ?	end
1	They should go to the courts .	end
1	Let them argue with each other there .	end
1	`` Is there something else you want to talk about ?	end
1	Then come to the regular town meeting of the people .	end
1	It can be decided there .	end
1	I say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting .	end
1	We could not explain all this trouble , because there is no real reason for this meeting . ''	end
1	After the city clerk said this , he told the people to go home .	end
1	In Jerusalem Saul was still trying to scare the followers of the Lord , even saying he would kill them .	end
1	He went to the high priest and asked him to write letters to the synagogues in the city of Damascus .	end
1	Saul wanted the high priest to give him the authority to find people in Damascus who were followers of the Way .	end
1	If he found any believers there , men or women , he would arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem .	end
1	So Saul went to Damascus .	end
1	When he came near the city , a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around him .	end
1	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , `` Saul , Saul !	end
1	Why are you persecuting me ? ''	end
1	Saul said , `` Who are you , Lord ? ''	end
1	The voice answered , `` I am Jesus , the one you are persecuting .	end
1	Get up now and go into the city .	end
1	Someone there will tell you what you must do . ''	end
1	The men traveling with Saul just stood there , unable to speak .	end
1	They heard the voice , but they saw no one .	end
1	Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes , but he could not see .	end
1	So the men with him held his hand and led him into Damascus .	end
1	For three days Saul could not see ; he did not eat or drink .	end
1	There was a follower of Jesus in Damascus named Ananias .	end
1	In a vision the Lord said to him , `` Ananias ! ''	end
1	Ananias answered , `` Here I am , Lord . ''	end
1	The Lord said to him , `` Get up and go to the street called Straight Street .	end
1	Find the house of Judas and ask for a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus .	end
1	He is there now , praying .	end
1	He has seen a vision in which a man named Ananias came and laid his hands on him so that he could see again . ''	end
1	But Ananias answered , `` Lord , many people have told me about this man .	end
1	They told me about the many bad things he did to your holy people in Jerusalem .	end
1	Now he has come here to Damascus .	end
1	The leading priests have given him the power to arrest all people who trust in you . ''	end
1	But the Lord Jesus said to Ananias , `` Go !	end
1	I have chosen Saul for an important work .	end
1	He must tell about me to other nations and their rulers and to the people of Israel .	end
1	I will show him all that he must suffer for me . ''	end
1	So Ananias left and went to the house of Judas .	end
1	He laid his hands on Saul and said , `` Saul , my brother , the Lord Jesus sent me .	end
1	He is the one you saw on the road when you came here .	end
1	He sent me so that you can see again and also be filled with the Holy Spirit . ''	end
1	Immediately , something that looked like fish scales fell off Saul 's eyes .	end
1	He was able to see !	end
1	Then he got up and was baptized .	end
1	After he ate , he began to feel strong again .	end
1	Saul stayed with the followers of Jesus in Damascus for a few days .	end
1	Soon he began to go to the synagogues and tell people about Jesus .	end
1	He told the people , `` Jesus is the Son of God ! ''	end
1	All the people who heard Saul were amazed .	end
1	They said , `` This is the same man who was in Jerusalem trying to destroy the people who trust in Jesus !	end
1	And that 's why he has come here -- to arrest the followers of Jesus and take them back to the leading priests . ''	end
1	But Saul became more and more powerful in proving that Jesus is the Christ .	end
1	His proofs were so strong that the Jews who lived in Damascus could not argue with him .	end
1	After many days , some Jews made plans to kill Saul .	end
1	They were watching the city gates day and night .	end
1	They wanted to kill Saul , but he learned about their plan .	end
1	One night some followers that Saul had taught helped him leave the city .	end
1	They put him in a basket and lowered it down through a hole in the city wall .	end
1	Then Saul went to Jerusalem .	end
1	He tried to join the group of followers , but they were all afraid of him .	end
1	They did not believe that he was really a follower of Jesus .	end
1	But Barnabas accepted Saul and took him to the apostles .	end
1	He told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to Saul .	end
1	Then he told them how boldly Saul had spoken for the Lord in Damascus .	end
1	And so Saul stayed with the followers and went all around Jerusalem speaking boldly for the Lord .	end
1	He often had arguments with the Greek - speaking Jews , who began making plans to kill him .	end
1	When the believers learned about this , they took Saul to Caesarea , and from there they sent him to the city of Tarsus .	end
1	The church in Judea , Galilee , and Samaria had a time of peace .	end
1	With the help of the Holy Spirit , the groups of believers became stronger and showed their respect for the Lord by the way they lived .	end
1	So the church everywhere grew in numbers .	end
1	Peter was traveling through all the areas around Jerusalem , and he stopped to visit the believers who lived in Lydda .	end
1	There he met a man named Aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years .	end
1	Peter said to him , `` Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you .	end
1	Get up and make your bed ! ''	end
1	He stood up immediately .	end
1	All the people living in Lydda and on the plain of Sharon saw him , and they decided to follow the Lord .	end
1	In the city of Joppa there was a follower of Jesus named Tabitha .	end
1	Her Greek name , Dorcas , means `` a deer . ''	end
1	She was always doing good things for people and giving money to those in need .	end
1	While Peter was in Lydda , Tabitha became sick and died .	end
1	They washed her body and put it in an upstairs room .	end
1	The followers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda , which was not far away .	end
1	So they sent two men , who begged him , `` Hurry , please come quickly ! ''	end
1	Peter got ready and went with them .	end
1	When he arrived , they took him to the upstairs room .	end
1	All the widows stood around him .	end
1	They were crying and showing him the coats and other clothes that Tabitha had made during her time with them .	end
1	Peter sent all the people out of the room .	end
1	He knelt down and prayed .	end
1	Then he turned to Tabitha 's body and said , `` Tabitha , stand up ! ''	end
1	She opened her eyes .	end
1	When she saw Peter , she sat up .	end
1	He gave her his hand and helped her stand up .	end
1	Then he called the believers and the widows into the room .	end
1	He showed them Tabitha ; she was alive !	end
1	People everywhere in Joppa learned about this , and many believed in the Lord .	end
1	Peter stayed in Joppa for many days at the home of a man named Simon , who was a leatherworker .	end
1	The first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth .	end
1	This place was inside a tent .	end
1	The first area in the tent was called the Holy Place .	end
1	In the Holy Place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to God .	end
1	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place .	end
1	In the Most Holy Place was a golden altar for burning incense .	end
1	And also there was the Box of the Agreement .	end
1	The Box was covered with gold .	end
1	Inside this Box was a golden jar of manna and Aaron 's rod -- the rod that once grew leaves .	end
1	Also in the Box were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments of the old agreement on them .	end
1	Above the Box were the Cherub angels that showed God 's glory .	end
1	These Cherub angels were over the place of mercy .	end
1	But we can not say everything about this now .	end
1	Everything in the tent was made ready in the way I have explained .	end
1	Then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .	end
1	But only the high priest could go into the second room , and he went in only once a year .	end
1	Also , he could never enter that room without taking blood with him .	end
1	He offered that blood to God for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning .	end
1	The Holy Spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the first room was still there .	end
1	This is an example for us today .	end
1	It shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to God are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear .	end
1	These gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings .	end
1	They are only rules about the body .	end
1	God gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way .	end
1	But Christ has already come to be the high priest .	end
1	He is the high priest of the good things we now have .	end
1	But Christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in .	end
1	He serves in a better place .	end
1	Unlike that tent , this one is perfect .	end
1	It was not made by anyone here on earth .	end
1	It does not belong to this world .	end
1	Christ entered the Most Holy Place only one time -- enough for all time .	end
1	He entered the Most Holy Place by using his own blood , not the blood of goats or young bulls .	end
1	He entered there and made us free from sin forever .	end
1	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship .	end
1	The blood and ashes made them pure again -- but only their bodies .	end
1	So surely the blood sacrifice of Christ can do much more .	end
1	Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit as a perfect sacrifice to God .	end
1	His blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done .	end
1	It will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living God .	end
1	So Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people .	end
1	He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised , blessings that last forever .	end
1	This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement .	end
1	When someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead .	end
1	A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living .	end
1	It can be used only after that person 's death .	end
1	That is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between God and his people .	end
1	First , Moses told the people every command in the law .	end
1	Then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water .	end
1	He used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people .	end
1	Then he said , `` This is the blood that makes the agreement good -- the agreement that God commanded you to follow . ''	end
1	In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent .	end
1	He sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .	end
1	The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood .	end
1	Sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice .	end
1	These things are copies of the real things that are in heaven .	end
1	These copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices .	end
1	But the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices .	end
1	Christ went into the Most Holy Place .	end
1	But it was not the man - made one , which is only a copy of the real one .	end
1	He went into heaven , and he is there now before God to help us .	end
1	The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year .	end
1	He takes with him blood to offer .	end
1	But he does not offer his own blood like Christ did .	end
1	Christ went into heaven , but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again .	end
1	If Christ had offered himself many times , he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made .	end
1	But he came to offer himself only once .	end
1	And that once is enough for all time .	end
1	He came at a time when the world is nearing an end .	end
1	He came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice .	end
1	Everyone must die once .	end
1	Then they are judged .	end
1	So Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people .	end
1	And he will come a second time , but not to offer himself for sin .	end
1	He will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .	end
1	I am a free man .	end
1	I am an apostle .	end
1	I have seen Jesus our Lord .	end
1	You people are an example of my work in the Lord .	end
1	Others may not accept me as an apostle , but surely you do .	end
1	You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .	end
1	Some people want to judge me .	end
1	So this is the answer I give them : We have the right to eat and drink , do n't we ?	end
1	We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel , do n't we ?	end
1	The other apostles and the Lord 's brothers and Peter all do this .	end
1	And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?	end
1	No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary .	end
1	No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself .	end
1	No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself .	end
1	These are n't just my own thoughts .	end
1	God 's law says the same thing .	end
1	Yes , it is written in the Law of Moses : ``	end
1	When a work animal is being used to separate grain , do n't keep it from eating the grain . ''	end
1	When God said this , was he thinking only about work animals ?	end
1	No .	end
1	He was really talking about us .	end
1	Yes , that was written for us .	end
1	The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work .	end
1	We planted spiritual seed among you , so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life .	end
1	Surely that is not asking too much .	end
1	Others have this right to get things from you .	end
1	So surely we have this right too .	end
1	But we do n't use this right .	end
1	No , we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ .	end
1	Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple .	end
1	And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .	end
1	It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News .	end
1	The Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work .	end
1	But I have not used any of these rights , and I am not trying to get anything from you .	end
1	That is not my purpose for writing this .	end
1	I would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride .	end
1	It 's not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast .	end
1	That is my duty -- something I must do .	end
1	If I do n't tell people the Good News , I am in real trouble .	end
1	If I did it because it was my own choice , I would deserve to be paid .	end
1	But I have no choice .	end
1	I must tell the Good News .	end
1	So I am only doing the duty that was given to me .	end
1	So what do I get for doing it ?	end
1	My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work .	end
1	I am free .	end
1	I belong to no other person , but I make myself a slave to everyone .	end
1	I do this to help save as many people as I can .	end
1	To the Jews I became like a Jew so that I could help save Jews .	end
1	I myself am not ruled by the law , but to those who are ruled by the law I became like someone who is ruled by the law .	end
1	I did this to help save those who are ruled by the law .	end
1	To those who are without the law I became like someone who is without the law .	end
1	I did this to help save those who are without the law .	end
1	-LRB- But really , I am not without God 's law -- I am ruled by the law of Christ . -RRB-	end
1	To those who are weak , I became weak so that I could help save them .	end
1	I have become all things to all people .	end
1	I did this so that I could save people in any way possible .	end
1	I do all this to make the Good News known .	end
1	I do it so that I can share in the blessings of the Good News .	end
1	You know that in a race all the runners run , but only one runner gets the prize .	end
1	So run like that .	end
1	Run to win !	end
1	All who compete in the games use strict training .	end
1	They do this so that they can win a prize -- one that does n't last .	end
1	But our prize is one that will last forever .	end
1	So I run like someone who has a goal .	end
1	I fight like a boxer who is hitting something , not just the air .	end
1	It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want .	end
1	I do this so that I wo n't miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it .	end
1	The fifth angel blew his trumpet .	end
1	Then I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth .	end
1	The star was given the key to the deep hole that leads down to the bottomless pit .	end
1	Then the star opened the hole leading to the pit .	end
1	Smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace .	end
1	The sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .	end
1	Then locusts came out of the smoke and went down to the earth .	end
1	They were given the power to sting like scorpions .	end
1	They were told not to damage the fields of grass or any plant or tree .	end
1	They were to hurt only those who did not have God 's mark on their foreheads .	end
1	They were not given the power to kill them but only to cause them pain for five months -- pain like a person feels when stung by a scorpion .	end
1	During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it .	end
1	They will want to die , but death will hide from them .	end
1	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle .	end
1	On their heads they wore something that looked like a gold crown .	end
1	Their faces looked like human faces .	end
1	Their hair was like women 's hair .	end
1	Their teeth were like lions ' teeth .	end
1	Their chests looked like iron breastplates .	end
1	The sound their wings made was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .	end
1	The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions .	end
1	The power they had to give people pain for five months was in their tails .	end
1	They had a ruler , who was the angel of the bottomless pit .	end
1	His name in Hebrew is Abaddon .	end
1	In Greek it is Apollyon .	end
1	The first terror is now past .	end
1	There are still two other terrors to come .	end
1	The sixth angel blew his trumpet .	end
1	Then I heard a voice coming from the horns on the four corners of the golden altar that is before God .	end
1	It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , `` Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates . ''	end
1	These four angels had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year .	end
1	The angels were set free to kill a third of all the people on the earth .	end
1	I heard how many troops on horses were in their army .	end
1	There were 200 , 000 , 000 .	end
1	In my vision , I saw the horses and the riders on the horses .	end
1	They looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur .	end
1	The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions .	end
1	The horses had fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .	end
1	A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues coming out of the horses ' mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .	end
1	The horses ' power was in their mouths and also in their tails .	end
1	Their tails were like snakes that have heads to bite and hurt people .	end
1	The other people on earth were not killed by these plagues .	end
1	But these people still did not change their hearts and turn away from worshiping the things they had made with their own hands .	end
1	They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood -- things that can not see or hear or walk .	end
1	They did not change their hearts and turn away from killing other people or from their evil magic , their sexual sins , and their stealing .	end
1	After this I heard what sounded like a large crowd of people in heaven .	end
1	The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !	end
1	Victory , glory , and power belong to our God .	end
1	His judgments are true and right .	end
1	Our God has punished the prostitute .	end
1	She is the one who ruined the earth with her sexual sin .	end
1	God has punished the prostitute to pay her back for the death of his servants . ''	end
1	These people also said , `` Hallelujah !	end
1	She is burning and her smoke will rise forever and ever . ''	end
1	Then the 24 elders and the four living beings bowed down .	end
1	They worshiped God , who sits on the throne .	end
1	They said , `` Amen !	end
1	Hallelujah ! ''	end
1	Then a voice came from the throne and said , `` Praise our God , all you who serve him !	end
1	Praise our God , all you small and great who honor him ! ''	end
1	Then I heard something that sounded like a large crowd of people .	end
1	It was as loud as crashing waves or claps of thunder .	end
1	The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !	end
1	Our Lord God rules .	end
1	He is the All - Powerful .	end
1	Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory !	end
1	Give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come .	end
1	And the Lamb 's bride has made herself ready .	end
1	Fine linen was given to the bride for her to wear .	end
1	The linen was bright and clean . ''	end
1	-LRB- The fine linen means the good things that God 's holy people did . -RRB-	end
1	Then the angel said to me , `` Write this : Great blessings belong to those who are invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ''	end
1	Then the angel said , `` These are the true words of God . ''	end
1	Then I bowed down before the angel 's feet to worship him .	end
1	But the angel said to me , `` Do n't worship me !	end
1	I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the truth of Jesus .	end
1	So worship God !	end
1	Because the truth of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . ''	end
1	Then I saw heaven open .	end
1	There before me was a white horse .	end
1	The rider on the horse was called Faithful and True , because he is right in his judging and in making war .	end
1	His eyes were like burning fire .	end
1	He had many crowns on his head .	end
1	A name was written on him , but he was the only one who knew its meaning .	end
1	He was dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and he was called the Word of God .	end
1	The armies of heaven were following the rider on the white horse .	end
1	They were also riding white horses .	end
1	They were dressed in fine linen , white and clean .	end
1	A sharp sword came out of the rider 's mouth , a sword that he would use to defeat the nations .	end
1	And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron .	end
1	He will crush the grapes in the winepress of the terrible anger of God All - Powerful .	end
1	On his robe and on his leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords Then I saw an angel standing in the sun .	end
1	In a loud voice the angel said to all the birds flying in the sky , `` Come together for the great supper of God .	end
1	Come together so that you can eat the bodies of rulers and army commanders and famous men .	end
1	Come to eat the bodies of the horses and their riders and the bodies of all people -- free , slave , small , and great . ''	end
1	Then I saw the beast and the rulers of the earth .	end
1	Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .	end
1	But the beast was captured , and the false prophet was also captured .	end
1	He was the one who did the miracles for the beast .	end
1	He had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its idol .	end
1	The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .	end
1	Their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse .	end
1	All the birds ate these bodies until they were full .	end
1	While Jesus was walking , he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born .	end
1	Jesus ' followers asked him , `` Teacher , why was this man born blind ?	end
1	Whose sin made it happen ?	end
1	Was it his own sin or that of his parents ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` It was not any sin of this man or his parents that caused him to be blind .	end
1	He was born blind so that he could be used to show what great things God can do .	end
1	While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me .	end
1	The night is coming , and no one can work at night .	end
1	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ''	end
1	After Jesus said this , he spit on the dirt , made some mud and put it on the man 's eyes .	end
1	Jesus told him , `` Go and wash in Siloam pool . ''	end
1	-LRB- Siloam means `` Sent . '' -RRB-	end
1	So the man went to the pool , washed and came back .	end
1	He was now able to see .	end
1	His neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said , `` Look !	end
1	Is this the same man who always sits and begs ? ''	end
1	Some people said , `` Yes !	end
1	He is the one . ''	end
1	But others said , `` No , he ca n't be the same man .	end
1	He only looks like him . ''	end
1	So the man himself said , `` I am that same man . ''	end
1	They asked , `` What happened ?	end
1	How did you get your sight ? ''	end
1	He answered , `` The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes .	end
1	Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash .	end
1	So I went there and washed .	end
1	And then I could see . ''	end
1	They asked him , `` Where is this man ? ''	end
1	He answered , `` I do n't know . ''	end
1	Then the people brought the man to the Pharisees .	end
1	The day Jesus had made mud and healed the man 's eyes was a Sabbath day .	end
1	So the Pharisees asked the man , `` How did you get your sight ? ''	end
1	He answered , `` He put mud on my eyes .	end
1	I washed , and now I can see . ''	end
1	Some of the Pharisees said , `` That man does not obey the law about the Sabbath day .	end
1	So he is not from God . ''	end
1	Others said , `` But someone who is a sinner can not do these miraculous signs . ''	end
1	So they could not agree with each other .	end
1	They asked the man again , `` Since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ''	end
1	He answered , `` He is a prophet . ''	end
1	The Jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man -- that he was blind and was now healed .	end
1	But later they sent for his parents .	end
1	They asked them , `` Is this your son ?	end
1	You say he was born blind .	end
1	So how can he see ? ''	end
1	His parents answered , `` We know that this man is our son .	end
1	And we know that he was born blind .	end
1	But we do n't know why he can see now .	end
1	We do n't know who healed his eyes .	end
1	Ask him .	end
1	He is old enough to answer for himself . ''	end
1	They said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders .	end
1	The leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said Jesus was the Christ .	end
1	They would stop them from coming to the synagogue .	end
1	That is why his parents said , `` He is old enough .	end
1	Ask him . ''	end
1	So the Jewish leaders called the man who had been blind .	end
1	They told him to come in again .	end
1	They said , `` You should honor God by telling the truth .	end
1	We know that this man is a sinner . ''	end
1	The man answered , `` I do n't know if he is a sinner .	end
1	But I do know this : I was blind , and now I can see . ''	end
1	They asked , `` What did he do to you ?	end
1	How did he heal your eyes ? ''	end
1	He answered , `` I have already told you that .	end
1	But you would not listen to me .	end
1	Why do you want to hear it again ?	end
1	Do you want to be his followers too ? ''	end
1	At this they shouted insults at him and said , `` You are his follower , not us !	end
1	We are followers of Moses .	end
1	We know that God spoke to Moses .	end
1	But we do n't even know where this man comes from ! ''	end
1	The man answered , `` This is really strange !	end
1	You do n't know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes .	end
1	We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him .	end
1	This is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind .	end
1	This man must be from God .	end
1	If he were not from God , he could not do anything like this . ''	end
1	The Jewish leaders answered , `` You were born full of sin !	end
1	Are you trying to teach us ? ''	end
1	And they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out .	end
1	When Jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , `` Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ''	end
1	The man said , `` Tell me who he is , sir , so I can believe in him . ''	end
1	Jesus said to him , `` You have already seen him .	end
1	The Son of Man is the one talking with you now . ''	end
1	The man answered , `` Yes , I believe , Lord ! ''	end
1	Then he bowed and worshiped Jesus .	end
1	Jesus said , `` I came into this world so that the world could be judged .	end
1	I came so that people who are blind could see .	end
1	And I came so that people who think they see would become blind . ''	end
1	Some of the Pharisees were near Jesus .	end
1	They heard him say this .	end
1	They asked , `` What ?	end
1	Are you saying that we are blind too ? ''	end
1	Jesus said , `` If you were really blind , you would not be guilty of sin .	end
1	But you say that you see , so you are still guilty . ''	end
1	Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped .	end
1	The soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head .	end
1	Then they put a purple robe around him .	end
1	They kept coming up to him and saying , `` Hail to the king of the Jews ! ''	end
1	And they hit him in the face .	end
1	Again Pilate came out and said to the Jewish leaders , `` Look !	end
1	I am bringing Jesus out to you .	end
1	I want you to know that I find nothing I can charge him with . ''	end
1	Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe .	end
1	Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is the man ! ''	end
1	When the leading priests and the Jewish guards saw Jesus they shouted , `` Kill him on a cross !	end
1	Kill him on a cross ! ''	end
1	But Pilate answered , `` You take him and nail him to a cross yourselves .	end
1	I find nothing I can charge him with . ''	end
1	The Jewish leaders answered , `` We have a law that says he must die , because he said he is the Son of God . ''	end
1	When Pilate heard this , he was more afraid .	end
1	So he went back inside the palace and asked Jesus , `` Where are you from ? ''	end
1	But Jesus did not answer him .	end
1	Pilate said , `` You refuse to speak to me ?	end
1	Remember , I have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God .	end
1	So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . ''	end
1	After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go free .	end
1	But the Jewish leaders shouted , `` Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar .	end
1	So if you let this man go free , that means you are not Caesar 's friend . ''	end
1	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out to the place called `` The Stone Pavement . ''	end
1	-LRB- In Aramaic the name is Gabbatha . -RRB-	end
1	Pilate sat down on the judge 's seat there .	end
1	It was now almost noon on Preparation day of Passover week .	end
1	Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is your king ! ''	end
1	They shouted , `` Take him away !	end
1	Take him away !	end
1	Kill him on a cross ! ''	end
1	Pilate asked them , `` Do you want me to kill your king on a cross ? ''	end
1	The leading priests answered , `` The only king we have is Caesar ! ''	end
1	So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be killed on a cross .	end
1	The soldiers took Jesus .	end
1	He carried his own cross to a place called `` The Place of the Skull . ''	end
1	-LRB- In Aramaic the name of this place is `` Golgotha . '' -RRB-	end
1	There they nailed Jesus to the cross .	end
1	They also nailed two other men to crosses .	end
1	They put them on each side of Jesus with him in the middle .	end
1	Pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross .	end
1	The sign said , `` jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews . ''	end
1	The sign was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek .	end
1	Many of the Jews read this sign , because the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross was near the city .	end
1	The leading Jewish priests said to Pilate , `` Do n't write , ' The King of the Jews . '	end
1	But write , ' This man said , I am the King of the Jews . ' ''	end
1	Pilate answered , `` I will not change what I have written . ''	end
1	After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts .	end
1	Each soldier got one part .	end
1	They also took his tunic .	end
1	It was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom .	end
1	So the soldiers said to each other , `` We should not tear this into parts .	end
1	Let 's throw lots to see who will get it . ''	end
1	This happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Scriptures say : `` They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for what I was wearing . ''	end
1	So the soldiers did this .	end
1	Jesus ' mother stood near his cross .	end
1	Her sister was also standing there with Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .	end
1	Jesus saw his mother .	end
1	He also saw the follower he loved very much standing there .	end
1	He said to his mother , `` Dear woman , here is your son . ''	end
1	Then he said to the follower , `` Here is your mother . ''	end
1	So after that , this follower took Jesus ' mother to live in his home .	end
1	Later , Jesus knew that everything had been done .	end
1	To make the Scriptures come true he said , `` I am thirsty . ''	end
1	There was a jar full of sour wine there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it .	end
1	They put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus ' mouth .	end
1	When he tasted the wine , he said , `` It is finished . ''	end
1	Then he bowed his head and died .	end
1	This day was Preparation day .	end
1	The next day was a special Sabbath day .	end
1	The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day .	end
1	So they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken .	end
1	And they asked that the bodies be taken down from the crosses .	end
1	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men on the crosses beside Jesus .	end
1	But when the soldiers came close to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead .	end
1	So they did not break his legs .	end
1	But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus '	end
1	side .	end
1	Immediately blood and water came out .	end
1	-LRB- The one who saw this happen has told about it .	end
1	He told about it so that you also can believe .	end
1	The things he says are true .	end
1	He knows that he tells the truth . -RRB-	end
1	These things happened to give full meaning to the Scriptures that said , `` None of his bones will be broken ''	end
1	and `` People will look at the one they stabbed . ''	end
1	Later , a man named Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus .	end
1	-LRB- Joseph was a follower of Jesus , but he did not tell anyone , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . -RRB-	end
1	Pilate said Joseph could take Jesus ' body , so he came and took it away .	end
1	Nicodemus went with Joseph .	end
1	He was the man who had come to Jesus before and talked to him at night .	end
1	He brought about 100 pounds of spices -- a mixture of myrrh and aloes .	end
1	These two men took Jesus ' body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices .	end
1	-LRB- This is how the Jews bury people . -RRB-	end
1	In the place where Jesus was killed on the cross , there was a garden .	end
1	In the garden there was a new tomb .	end
1	No one had ever been buried there before .	end
1	The men put Jesus in that tomb because it was near , and the Jews were preparing to start their Sabbath day .	end
1	Jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town .	end
1	Some people brought to him a man who was paralyzed and was lying on a mat .	end
1	Jesus saw that these people had much faith .	end
1	So he said to the paralyzed man , `` Young man , you will be glad to hear this .	end
1	Your sins are forgiven . ''	end
1	Some of the teachers of the law heard what Jesus said .	end
1	They said to themselves , `` What an insult to God for this man to say that ! ''	end
1	Jesus knew what they were thinking .	end
1	So he said , `` Why are you thinking such evil thoughts ?	end
1	The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins .	end
1	But how can I prove this to you ?	end
1	Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say , ' Your sins are forgiven . '	end
1	There 's no proof that it really happened .	end
1	But what if I say to the man , ' Stand up and walk ' ?	end
1	Then you will be able to see that I really have this power . ''	end
1	So Jesus said to the paralyzed man , `` Stand up .	end
1	Take your mat and go home . ''	end
1	The man stood up and went home .	end
1	The people saw this and they were amazed .	end
1	They praised God for letting someone have such power .	end
1	When Jesus was leaving , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the place for collecting taxes .	end
1	Jesus said to him , `` Follow me . ''	end
1	So he got up and followed Jesus .	end
1	Jesus ate dinner at Matthew 's house .	end
1	Many tax collectors and others with bad reputations came and ate with him and his followers .	end
1	The Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with these people .	end
1	They asked his followers , `` Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners ? ''	end
1	Jesus heard them say this .	end
1	So he said to them , `` It is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy .	end
1	You need to go and learn what this Scripture means : ' I do n't want animal sacrifices ; I want you to show kindness to people . '	end
1	I did not come to invite good people .	end
1	I came to invite sinners . ''	end
1	Then the followers of John came to Jesus and said , `` We and the Pharisees fast often , but your followers do n't ever fast .	end
1	Why ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` At a wedding the friends of the bridegroom are not sad while he is with them .	end
1	They can not fast then .	end
1	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them .	end
1	Then they will fast .	end
1	`` When someone sews a patch over a hole in an old coat , they never use a piece of cloth that has not already been shrunk .	end
1	If they do , the patch will shrink and pull away from the coat .	end
1	Then the hole will be worse .	end
1	Also , people never pour new wine into old wineskins .	end
1	They would break , the wine would spill out , and the wineskins would be ruined .	end
1	People always put new wine into new wineskins , which wo n't break , and the wine stays good . ''	end
1	While Jesus was still talking , a leader of the synagogue came to him .	end
1	The leader bowed down before him and said , `` My daughter has just died .	end
1	But if you will come and touch her with your hand , she will live again . ''	end
1	So Jesus and his followers went with the man .	end
1	On the way , there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years .	end
1	She came close behind Jesus and touched the bottom of his coat .	end
1	She was thinking , `` If I can touch his coat , I will be healed . ''	end
1	Jesus turned and saw the woman .	end
1	He said , `` Be happy , dear woman .	end
1	You are made well because you believed . ''	end
1	Then the woman was healed .	end
1	Jesus continued going with the Jewish leader and went into the leader 's house .	end
1	He saw people there who make music for funerals .	end
1	And he saw a crowd of people crying loudly .	end
1	Jesus said , `` Go away .	end
1	The girl is not dead .	end
1	She is only sleeping . ''	end
1	But the people laughed at him .	end
1	After the people were put out of the house , Jesus went into the girl 's room .	end
1	He held the girl 's hand , and the girl stood up .	end
1	The news about this spread all around the area .	end
1	As Jesus was going away from there , two blind men followed him .	end
1	They said loudly , `` Show kindness to us , Son of David . ''	end
1	Jesus went inside , and the blind men went with him .	end
1	He asked them , `` Do you believe that I am able to make you see again ? ''	end
1	They answered , `` Yes , Lord , we believe . ''	end
1	Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , `` You believe that I can make you see again , so it will happen . ''	end
1	Then the men were able to see .	end
1	Jesus gave them a strong warning .	end
1	He said , `` Do n't tell anyone about this . ''	end
1	But they left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area .	end
1	As these two men were leaving , some people brought another man to Jesus .	end
1	This man could not talk because he had a demon inside him .	end
1	Jesus forced the demon out , and the man was able to talk .	end
1	The people were amazed and said , `` We have never seen anything like this in Israel . ''	end
1	But the Pharisees said , `` The ruler of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out . ''	end
1	Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages .	end
1	He taught in their synagogues and told people the Good News about God 's kingdom .	end
1	He healed all kinds of diseases and sicknesses .	end
1	Jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless -- like sheep without a shepherd to lead them .	end
1	Jesus said to his followers , `` There is such a big harvest of people to bring in .	end
1	But there are only a few workers to help harvest them .	end
1	God owns the harvest .	end
1	Ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest . ''	end
1	After Jesus said all these things , he left Galilee .	end
1	He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River .	end
1	Many people followed him .	end
1	Jesus healed the sick people there .	end
1	Some Pharisees came to Jesus .	end
1	They tried to make him say something wrong .	end
1	They asked him , `` Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` Surely you have read this in the Scriptures : When God made the world , ' he made people male and female . '	end
1	And God said , ' That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .	end
1	And the two people will become one . '	end
1	So they are no longer two , but one .	end
1	God has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ''	end
1	The Pharisees asked , `` Then why did Moses give a command allowing a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept God 's teaching .	end
1	But divorce was not allowed in the beginning .	end
1	I tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for the problem of sexual sin , and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . ''	end
1	The followers said to Jesus , `` If that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry . ''	end
1	He answered , `` This statement is true for some , but not for everyone -- only for those who have been given this gift .	end
1	There are different reasons why some men do n't marry .	end
1	Some were born without the ability to produce children .	end
1	Others were made that way later in life .	end
1	And others have given up marriage because of God 's kingdom .	end
1	This is for anyone who is able to accept it . ''	end
1	Then the people brought their little children to Jesus so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them and pray for them .	end
1	When the followers saw this , they told the people to stop bringing their children to him .	end
1	But Jesus said , `` Let the little children come to me .	end
1	Do n't stop them , because God 's kingdom belongs to people who are like these children . ''	end
1	After Jesus blessed the children , he left there .	end
1	A man came to Jesus and asked , `` Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` Why do you ask me about what is good ?	end
1	Only God is good .	end
1	But if you want to have eternal life , obey the law 's commands . ''	end
1	The man asked , `` Which ones ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` ' You must not murder anyone , you must not commit adultery , you must not steal , you must not tell lies about others , you must respect your father and mother , ' and ' love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ' ''	end
1	The young man said , `` I have obeyed all these commands .	end
1	What else do I need ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` If you want to be perfect , then go and sell all that you own .	end
1	Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven .	end
1	Then come and follow me ! ''	end
1	But when the young man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money , he was sad .	end
1	He did n't want to do this , because he was very rich .	end
1	So he left .	end
1	Then Jesus said to his followers , `` The truth is , it will be very hard for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom .	end
1	Yes , I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom . ''	end
1	The followers were amazed to hear this .	end
1	They asked , `` Then who can be saved ? ''	end
1	Jesus looked at them and said , `` This is something that people can not do .	end
1	But God can do anything . ''	end
1	Peter said to him , `` We left everything we had and followed you .	end
1	So what will we have ? ''	end
1	Jesus said to them , `` When the time of the new world comes , the Son of Man will sit on his great and glorious throne .	end
1	And I can promise that you who followed me will sit on twelve thrones , and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel .	end
1	Everyone who has left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms to follow me will get much more than they left .	end
1	And they will have eternal life .	end
1	Many people who are first now will be last in the future .	end
1	And many who are last now will be first in the future .	end
1	Then Jesus said , `` Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom come with power before you die . ''	end
1	Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John and went up on a high mountain .	end
1	They were all alone there .	end
1	While these followers watched him , Jesus was changed .	end
1	His clothes became shining white -- whiter than anyone on earth could make them .	end
1	Then two men were there talking with Jesus .	end
1	They were Elijah and Moses .	end
1	Peter said to Jesus , `` Teacher , it is good that we are here .	end
1	We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''	end
1	Peter did not know what to say , because he and the other two followers were so afraid .	end
1	Then a cloud came and covered them .	end
1	A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son , the one I love .	end
1	Obey him ! ''	end
1	The followers looked , but they saw only Jesus there alone with them .	end
1	As Jesus and the followers were walking back down the mountain , he gave them these instructions : `` Do n't tell anyone about what you saw on the mountain .	end
1	Wait until after the Son of Man rises from death .	end
1	Then you can tell people what you saw . ''	end
1	So the followers waited to say anything about what they saw .	end
1	But they discussed among themselves what Jesus meant about rising from death .	end
1	They asked him , `` Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` They are right to say that Elijah must come first .	end
1	Elijah makes all things the way they should be .	end
1	But why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will think he is worth nothing ?	end
1	I tell you that Elijah has already come .	end
1	And people did to him all the bad things they wanted to do .	end
1	The Scriptures said this would happen to him . ''	end
1	Then Jesus , Peter , James , and John went to the other followers .	end
1	They saw many people around them .	end
1	The teachers of the law were arguing with the followers .	end
1	When the people saw Jesus , they were very surprised and ran to welcome him .	end
1	Jesus asked , `` What are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? ''	end
1	A man answered , `` Teacher , I brought my son to you .	end
1	He is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps him from talking .	end
1	The spirit attacks him and throws him on the ground .	end
1	He foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes very stiff .	end
1	I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they could not . ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` You people today do n't believe !	end
1	How long must I stay with you ?	end
1	How long must I be patient with you ?	end
1	Bring the boy to me ! ''	end
1	So the followers brought the boy to Jesus .	end
1	When the evil spirit saw Jesus , it attacked the boy .	end
1	The boy fell down and rolled on the ground .	end
1	He was foaming at the mouth .	end
1	Jesus asked the boy 's father , `` How long has this been happening to him ? ''	end
1	The father answered , `` Since he was very young .	end
1	The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him .	end
1	If you can do anything , please have pity on us and help us . ''	end
1	Jesus said to the father , `` Why did you say ' if you can ' ?	end
1	All things are possible for the one who believes . ''	end
1	Immediately the father shouted , `` I do believe .	end
1	Help me to believe more ! ''	end
1	Jesus saw that all the people were running there to see what was happening .	end
1	So he spoke to the evil spirit .	end
1	He said , `` You evil spirit that makes this boy deaf and stops him from talking -- I command you to come out of him and never enter him again ! ''	end
1	The evil spirit screamed .	end
1	It caused the boy to fall on the ground again , and then it came out .	end
1	The boy looked as if he was dead .	end
1	Many people said , `` He is dead ! ''	end
1	But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .	end
1	Then Jesus went into the house .	end
1	His followers were alone with him there .	end
1	They said , `` Why were n't we able to force that evil spirit out ? ''	end
1	Jesus answered , `` That kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . ''	end
1	Then Jesus and his followers left there and went through Galilee .	end
1	Jesus did not want the people to know where they were .	end
1	He wanted to teach his followers alone .	end
1	He said to them , `` The Son of Man will be handed over to the control of other men , who will kill him .	end
1	After three days , he will rise from death . ''	end
1	But the followers did not understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him .	end
1	Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum .	end
1	They went into a house , and Jesus said to them , `` I heard you arguing on the way here today .	end
1	What were you arguing about ? ''	end
1	But the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .	end
1	Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him .	end
1	He said , `` Whoever wants to be the most important must make others more important than themselves .	end
1	They must serve everyone else . ''	end
1	Then Jesus took a small child and stood the child in front of the followers .	end
1	He held the child in his arms and said , `` Whoever accepts children like these in my name is accepting me .	end
1	And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . ''	end
1	Then John said , `` Teacher , we saw a man using your name to force demons out of someone .	end
1	He is not one of us .	end
1	So we told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group . ''	end
1	Jesus said , `` Do n't stop him .	end
1	Whoever uses my name to do powerful things will not soon say bad things about me .	end
1	Whoever is not against us is with us .	end
1	I can assure you that anyone who helps you by giving you a drink of water because you belong to the Christ will definitely get a reward .	end
1	`` If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it will be very bad for that person .	end
1	It would be better for them to have a millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the sea .	end
1	If your hand makes you sin , cut it off .	end
1	It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two hands and go to hell .	end
1	There the fire never stops .	end
1	If your foot makes you sin , cut it off .	end
1	It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two feet and be thrown into hell .	end
1	If your eye makes you sin , take it out .	end
1	It is better for you to have only one eye and enter God 's kingdom than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .	end
1	The worms that eat the people in hell never die .	end
1	The fire there is never stopped .	end
1	`` Everyone will be salted with fire .	end
1	`` Salt is good .	end
1	But if it loses its salty taste , you ca n't make it good again .	end
1	So , do n't lose that good quality of salt you have .	end
1	And live in peace with each other . ''	end
1	I am in Christ and I am telling you the truth .	end
1	I am not lying .	end
1	And my conscience , ruled by the Holy Spirit , agrees that what I say now is true .	end
1	I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for my own people .	end
1	They are my brothers and sisters , my earthly family .	end
1	I wish I could help them .	end
1	I would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from Christ if that would help them .	end
1	They are the people of Israel , God 's chosen children .	end
1	They have the glory of God and the agreements he made between himself and his people .	end
1	God gave them the Law of Moses , the Temple worship , and his promises .	end
1	They are the descendants of our great fathers , and they are the earthly family of Christ .	end
1	And Christ is God over all things .	end
1	Praise him forever !	end
1	Amen .	end
1	I do n't mean that God failed to keep his promise to the Jewish people .	end
1	But only some of the people of Israel are really God 's people .	end
1	And only some of Abraham 's descendants are true children of Abraham .	end
1	This is what God said to Abraham : `` Your true descendants will be those who come through Isaac . ''	end
1	This means that not all of Abraham 's descendants are God 's true children .	end
1	Abraham 's true children are those who become God 's children because of the promise he made to Abraham .	end
1	Here is what God said in that promise : `` About this time next year I will come back , and Sarah will have a son . ''	end
1	And that is not all .	end
1	Rebecca also had sons , and they had the same father .	end
1	He is our father Isaac .	end
1	But before the two sons were born , God told Rebecca , `` The older son will serve the younger . ''	end
1	This was before the boys had done anything good or bad .	end
1	God said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of God 's own plan .	end
1	He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call , not because of anything the boys did .	end
1	As the Scriptures say , `` I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau . ''	end
1	So what does this mean ?	end
1	That God is not fair ?	end
1	We can not say that .	end
1	God said to Moses , `` I will show mercy to anyone I want to show mercy to .	end
1	I will show pity to anyone I choose . ''	end
1	So God will choose anyone he decides to show mercy to , and his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do .	end
1	In the Scriptures God says to Pharaoh : `` I made you king so that you could do this for me .	end
1	I wanted to show my power through you .	end
1	I wanted my name to be announced throughout the world . ''	end
1	So God shows mercy to those he wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn .	end
1	So one of you will ask me , `` If God controls what we do , why does he blame us for our sins ? ''	end
1	Do n't ask that .	end
1	You are only human and have no right to question God .	end
1	A clay jar does not question the one who made it .	end
1	It does not say , `` Why did you make me like this ? ''	end
1	The one who makes the jar can make anything he wants .	end
1	He uses the same clay to make different things .	end
1	He might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use .	end
1	It is the same way with what God has done .	end
1	He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power .	end
1	But he patiently endured those he was angry with -- people who were ready to be destroyed .	end
1	He waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy .	end
1	God has already prepared them to share his glory .	end
1	We are those people , the ones God chose not only from the Jews but also from those who are not Jews .	end
1	As the Scriptures say in the book of Hosea , `` The people who are not mine -- I will say they are my people .	end
1	And the people I did not love -- I will say they are the people I love . ''	end
1	And , `` Where God said in the past , ' You are not my people ' -- there they will be called children of the living God . ''	end
1	And Isaiah cries out about Israel : `` There are so many people of Israel , they are like the grains of sand by the sea .	end
1	But only a few of them will be saved .	end
1	Yes , the Lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth . ''	end
1	It is just as Isaiah said : `` The Lord All - Powerful allowed some of our people to live .	end
1	If he had not done that , we would now be like Sodom , and we would be like Gomorrah . ''	end
1	So what does all this mean ?	end
1	It means that people who are not Jews were made right with God because of their faith , even though they were not trying to make themselves right .	end
1	And the people of Israel , who tried to make themselves right with God by following the law , did not succeed .	end
1	They failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did .	end
1	They did not trust in God to make them right .	end
1	They fell over the stone that makes people fall .	end
1	The Scriptures talk about that stone : `` Look , I put in Zion a stone that will make people stumble .	end
1	It is a rock that will make people fall .	end
1	But anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ''	end

1	Old folk in the South remember when wax apples were " just something to munch on " - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to .	South ! location ;
1	But wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years , thanks to advances in the way that they are grown .	the past 30 years ! date ;
1	For example , the " bag - wrap " method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to Linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin .

1	The method soon caught on throughout the district .	end
1	Another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields .	end

1	But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .	end
1	To assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised .	end

1	" What they have n't attained yet they probably wo n't attain ever , so it 's not worth getting all worked up about it .	end
1	This is the time of life when the doubts set in . "	end
1	Many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves , " Is this really what I want ?	end
1	What has been the point of all my hard striving ? "	end
1	When the doubts come , some people continue trying to find answers from outside , thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives !	end
1	But then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they 've just made things worse .	end
1	" In middle age you start to listen to what 's going on inside , " says Lu .	Lu ! person ;
1	" It 's the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul . "	end
1	People ask themselves : Am I truly happy ?	end
1	Do I like the person I see in the mirror ?	end
1	Why ?	end
1	What dreams can I pursue ?	end
1	At this point , there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards .	end
1	Instead it 's more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance .	end
1	" One need not compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , " notes Chiu .	Chiu ! person ;
1	Everyone 's circumstances and personalities are different , and they place different expectations on themselves .	end
1	It 's not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need to follow the currents of fashion .	end

1	Biochips come in two main types : the microfluidics chip or " lab - on - a - chip , " and the microarray chip or " DNA chip . "	end
1	Microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology , microelectronics , micromachining and other technologies to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form .	end
1	Meanwhile on microarray chips , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots .	end
1	BMEC researcher Pan Chao - chi uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of chips .	BMEC ! org ; Pan Chao - chi ! person ;
1	To test a blood sample using a microarray chip , the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the " hybridization " reaction takes place .	end
1	Finally , the results are analyzed using a detection system .	end
1	Hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory .	end
1	In contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result .	end

1	Can Taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?	Taiwan ! country ;
1	BMEC director Johnsee Lee observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited .	BMEC ! org ; Johnsee Lee ! person ;
1	However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .	Taiwan ! country ;

1	The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome .	end
1	Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .	end
1	" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says Johnsee Lee .	Johnsee Lee ! person ;
1	In his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .	end
1	In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .	end

1	He says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback .	end
1	Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .	end
1	Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .	Lee ! person ;
1	He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .	one to two years ! date ; around three years ! date ;

1	it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look .	end
1	But do n't overdo it .	end
1	It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .	end

1	To express its determination , the Chinese securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast .	Chinese ! national ;

1	Hello , dear viewers .	end
1	Welcome to Focus Today .	Focus Today ! org ;
1	Today , let 's turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in Beijing over the holiday .	Today ! date ; Beijing ! country ;
1	Before dawn on January 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of Jingguang Bridge , East Third Ring Road , Beijing Municipality , resulting in the road caving in .	January 3 ! date ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Beijing Municipality ! country ;
1	Relevant departments from Beijing Municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans .	Beijing Municipality ! country ;
1	The traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .	end
1	Well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?	end
1	After the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak commute ?	end
1	In addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?	end
1	Well , we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us .	two ! num ; today ! date ;
1	One of the two honorable guests in the studio is Professor Zhou Hanhua from the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .	One ! num ; two ! num ; Zhou Hanhua ! person ; the Institute of Law ! org ; the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ! org ;
1	Hello .	end
1	Next is Yang Yang , a host of Beijing Traffic Radio Station .	Yang Yang ! person ; Beijing Traffic Radio Station ! org ;
1	Hello .	end
1	Welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program .	end
1	Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?	two ! num ;
1	Ah , , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside .	about 11:00 m. yesterday ! time ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon .	noon ! time ;
1	And then , the friend first sent me an SMS , Uh-huh . saying he would come pick me up to go together .	first ! order ;
1	After that , I received an SMS from 1860 .	1860 ! num ;
1	Uh-huh , it was through an SMS .	end
1	And you , Yang Yang ?	Yang Yang ! person ;
1	A friend happened to call me .	end
1	You were not at work that day ?	that day ! date ;
1	No .	end
1	The station called me at noon and said something happened at Jingguang Bridge and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program .	noon ! time ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ;
1	Uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .	end
1	Right , right , right .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Well , like Professor Zhou , I also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone SMS .	Zhou ! person ;
1	At that time , , it can be said that this SMS was among the many , ha , SMS containing New Year wishes , like Happy New Year , received after the start of the New Year .	New Year ! thing ; New Year ! thing ; the New Year ! thing ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Ah , actually I felt a lot of warmth when I received that SMS .	end
1	Although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , I think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news .	end
1	Yes , exceptionally .	end
1	Yes , exceptionally .	end
1	Well , what in fact was the content of that SMS ?	end
1	Let 's take a look via this footage , ha .	end
1	I remember the SMS was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road , Jingguang Bridge , and East Third Ring Road , and requesting cars to make a detour .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Chaoyang Road ! fact ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
1	Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent .	end
1	Furthermore , there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .	one ! num ;
1	Ah , after the SMS was sent , , I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality , ah , used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency .	first ! order ; Beijing Municipality ! country ;
1	I do n't know , all of us are living in Beijing , is this the first time , Professor Zhou ?	Beijing ! country ; first ! order ; Zhou ! person ;
1	Yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 .	first ! order ; 1860 ! num ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	Other places in the country must have used this too .	end
1	Uh-huh , uh-huh .	end
1	Must have used this too .	end
1	Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent .	last year ! date ; Beijing ! country ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?	end
1	Yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by Beijing Municipality , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .	Beijing Municipality ! org ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .	end
1	In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .	end
1	We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .	end
1	Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .	end
1	Right .	end
1	It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .	end
1	Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as , these electronic signatures .	end
1	These are quite sophisticated forms .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	In particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government .	end
1	Hence , I think this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah .	2003 ! date ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	They said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .	end
1	Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang .	Beijing ! country ; Yang Yang ! person ;
1	If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?	that day ! date ;
1	Yes .	end
1	Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis .	end
1	This is the most appropriate word to use .	end
1	Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well .	China ! country ;
1	Why is that so ?	end
1	This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage .	China ! country ;
1	There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah .	China ! country ;
1	So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .	end
1	Yes , I noticed that many friends , around me received it .	end
1	It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	The effect was extremely good , ha .	end
1	So , how exactly did citizens react ?	end
1	Let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .	end
1	-- an SMS .	end
1	I saw it was that Jingguang Bridge .	that Jingguang Bridge ! fact ;
1	Hey , I say , this is quite good , quite good .	end
1	Have you received information like this before ?	end
1	No , no .	end
1	This was the first time .	first ! order ;
1	The first time ?	first ! order ;
1	Yes , yes .	end
1	Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?	end
1	Quite fast .	end
1	Really quite fast , ah .	end
1	So , I did not drive today .	today ! date ;
1	I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .	end
1	Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?	end
1	Ah , the response was quite fast .	end
1	In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .	end
1	Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .	end
1	I think this plan was quite speedy .	end
1	It seems that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .	end
1	Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .	end
1	Let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .	end
1	Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .	end
1	Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road .	the Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
1	All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .	end
1	See , through this footage , we see , ah , this --	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock .	4 o'clock ! time ;
1	That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .	end
1	Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .	end
1	Well , ah , Yang Yang , you work at Traffic Radio Station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .	Yang Yang ! person ; Traffic Radio Station ! org ;
1	A special program .	end
1	Yes , a special program on this traffic .	end
1	So , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .	first ! order ;
1	Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?	end
1	Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing .	Beijing ! country ;
1	Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing .	Beijing ! country ;
1	That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .	the Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; the Third Ring Road ! fact ; Third Ring Road ! fact ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .	Second Ring Road ! fact ; Fourth Ring Road ! fact ;
1	Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .	about half an hour to an hour ! time ;
1	Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; Changhong Bridge ! fact ; Guomao Bridge ! fact ;
1	Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .	first ! order ;
1	Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .	6:30 a .m . today ! time ;
1	However , actually after the entire day today , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .	the entire day today ! date ; Beijing today ! country ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	However , the affected area was not as large as expected .	end
1	Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .	end
1	Right .	end
1	Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .	end
1	Because I know this situation .	end
1	Right , like those whom we interviewed just now .	end
1	It was easy to handle once everyone understood .	end
1	Yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , I set out today before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed .	today ! date ;
1	That person did not even drive .	end
1	Right .	end
1	Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .	end
1	For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS .	end
1	A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .	12th ! order ; the China World Trade Center ! fact ; the Guomao Bridge ! fact ;
1	We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .	end
1	Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center .	the China World Trade Center ! fact ;
1	Right .	end
1	Hey , he said this was quite a good idea .	end
1	Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .	end
1	Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .	Beijing ! country ;
1	Ah , we can take a look later through an animation .	end
1	This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
1	Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .	Chaoyang Road ! fact ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .	Chaoyang Road ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
1	Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .	Chaoyang Road ! fact ;
1	Yes .	end
1	When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .	end
1	Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .	end
1	Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ;
1	Yes .	end
1	As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .	the Third Ring Road ! fact ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; 32 ! num ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .	one ! num ; 32 ! num ;
1	If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --	end
1	It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .	end
1	Right .	end
1	Have not seen so many buses .	end
1	Right .	end
1	Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?	end
1	Our correspondent specially interviewed Director Meng Xianlong , Mr. Meng Xianlong , of the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration .	Meng Xianlong ! person ; Meng Xianlong ! person ; the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration ! org ;
1	Let 's hear what Director Meng said .	Meng ! person ;
1	Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .	end
1	In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .	first ! order ;
1	In this way , all vehicles going along East Third Ring Road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ;
1	East Third Ring Road is a traffic artery in the east of Beijing that links the north and the south .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Beijing ! country ;
1	In order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .	end
1	We set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along East Second Ring Road , East Fourth Ring Road , West Dawang Road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .	68 ! num ; East Second Ring Road ! fact ; East Fourth Ring Road ! fact ; West Dawang Road ! fact ; 210 ! num ;
1	It can be said that measures were very promptly taken .	end
1	Ah , today is the first workday after the New Year holiday .	today ! date ; first ! order ; New Year ! thing ;
1	Well , what exactly was the situation this morning ?	end
1	We specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .	this morning ! num ;
1	Let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .	end
1	Well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at East Third Ring Road , ah , near Guanghua Bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of Jingguang Bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .	East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Guanghua Bridge ! fact ; Jingguang Bridge ! fact ;
1	Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .	Beijing ! country ; minus 3 degrees ! measure ;
1	Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .	end
1	Ah , it can be said , ah , Yang Yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .	Yang Yang ! person ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Right , right .	end
1	, through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?	end
1	Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .	end
1	Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .	Jingguang Bridge ! fact ; CBD ! country ; early in the morning ! time ;
1	Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .	today ! date ;
1	Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .	end
1	We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .	end
1	This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .	end
1	I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .	one ! num ; Beijing ! country ;
1	On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .	end
1	That is , they think that the government has tried its best .	end
1	Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Well , Professor Zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?	Zhou ! person ; one ! num ;
1	Yes .	end
1	In terms of citizens ' mentality .	end
1	Yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .	end
1	That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .	end
1	We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .	end
1	Time was lost .	end
1	Well , yes , the State Council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .	the State Council ! org ;
1	That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .	first ! order ;
1	In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .	end
1	That is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .	end
1	I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .	end
1	Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .	end
1	Traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred .	first ! order ;
1	However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	Yang Yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?	Yang Yang ! person ;
1	Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground .	end
1	They include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .	end
1	Truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .	end
1	Closely linked .	end
1	Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .	end
1	Let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .	end
1	Ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission , ah , the Communication Commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work .	the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission ! org ; the Communication Commission ! org ;
1	Relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period .	end
1	Well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .	end
1	Well , ah , Professor Zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?	Zhou ! person ;
1	Yes .	end
1	This is also --	end
1	It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .	end
1	Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .	end
1	How many groups of people will be sent ?	end
1	Many groups .	end
1	Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .	end
1	It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?	end
1	Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .	end
1	For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .	end
1	However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .	Beijing Municipality ! country ; Beijing Municipality ! country ;
1	Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	It was a very successful , er , response .	end
1	I think many good things can be summed up from this .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?	Yang Yang ! person ;
1	For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .	Beijing ! country ; last night ! time ; one ! num ;
1	Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .	end
1	Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .	about 70,000 square meters ! measure ; Beijing ! country ;
1	Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .	Chaoyang ! country ;
1	After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .	more than 200 ! num ;
1	It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .	yesterday ! date ;
1	Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .	end
1	Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .	end
1	I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .	Zhou ! person ; Beijing ! country ; more than 14 million ! num ;
1	Yes .	end
1	I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .	end
1	For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .	end
1	Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .	end
1	This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .	end
1	It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .	end
1	Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .	end
1	The critical thing is --	end
1	But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .	Beijing Municipality ! country ; recent years ! date ; a few years ago ! date ; East Third Ring Road ! fact ; Beijing Municipality 's ! country ;
1	Right .	end
1	It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .	end
1	Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .	Yang Yang ! person ;
1	Yes .	end
1	Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .	end
1	It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .	Beijing Traffic Radio Station ! org ; Beijing ! country ;
1	Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .	Beijing Traffic Radio Station ! org ; three ! num ;
1	Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .	Zhou ! person ;
1	Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .	Beijing Municipality ! country ;
1	Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .	Unblocked All the Way ! org ; that evening ! time ;
1	Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .	end
1	Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .	end
1	It was not clear , it was very congested .	end
1	You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .	end
1	You could find out other news only by telephone .	end
1	The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .	end
1	Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .	two years ago ! date ;
1	From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .	today ! date ;
1	Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .	end
1	Ah , apart from this , Professor Zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?	Zhou ! person ;
1	Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah .	end
1	First , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .	First ! order ;
1	This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .	end
1	Early warnings and forecasts .	end
1	Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	It is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .	end
1	In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .	end
1	For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .	end
1	We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .	end
1	That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .	end
1	However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .	end
1	Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .	end
1	Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?	end
1	I think , in comparison to China , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .	China ! country ;
1	Their level of development is more advanced than ours .	end
1	Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .	1 % ! per ;
1	For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .	end
1	With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?	end
1	How can a safe , assured system be established ?	end
1	Well , we need to learn and manage this .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .	end
1	However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .	end
1	Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .	end
1	Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?	end
1	We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .	end
1	Well , how will they undergo testing ?	end
1	These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .	end
1	So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .	end
1	That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .	end
1	How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?	end
1	The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems .	The State Council ! org ; One ! num ; Three ! num ;
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	" One plan " refers to the contingency plan , and " three systems " refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .	One ! num ; three ! num ;
1	So , I think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .	three ! num ;
1	Yes .	end
1	Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in Beijing .	Beijing ! country ;
1	Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now .	end
1	Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .	end
1	Well , Yang Yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?	Yang Yang ! person ;
1	I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .	end
1	This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .	end
1	Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .	end
1	Uh-huh .	end
1	This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .	end
1	There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .	end
1	Yes , the pipes below .	end
1	Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --	end
1	Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .	end
1	Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .	end
1	But in the end , it requires time .	end
1	Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .	end
1	Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline .	end
1	The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	In addition , waste discharge is also very important .	end
1	Waste discharged has currently blocked this up .	end
1	Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .	end
1	Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .	end
1	Yes .	end
1	At present , we should not have a problem with watching television .	end
1	They are not broken .	end
1	It is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .	end
1	After that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section .	end
1	Furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .	end
1	Because they were exposed , The water pipes were not --	end
1	after that , yes , these were not damaged .	end
1	they were not damaged and this is quite normal .	end
1	Um , there is no problem with water supply .	end
1	Okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in Beijing Municipality .	today ! date ; Beijing Municipality ! country ;
1	At the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases .	end

1	Well we are pursuing a very aggressive resolution up in New York at the Security Council /.	New York ! country ; the Security Council ! org ;

1	And we 've also had a very interesting development today /.	today ! date ;
1	the Chinese Government is sending tonight to a senior delegation /.	Chinese ! national ; tonight ! time ;
1	And you know frankly we think it 's time for China to use its influence with North Korea /.	China ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	The Chinese have influence certainly more than the United States and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem /.	Chinese ! national ; the United States ! country ;
1	China now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward , to send the North Koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the North Koreans now have to come back to the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they 've got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago /.	China ! country ; the North Koreans ! national ; the North Koreans ! national ; September nineteenth two thousand five ! date ; nearly a year ago ! date ;
1	But the South Koreans and the Chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against North Korea /.	the South Koreans ! national ; Chinese ! national ; North Korea ! country ;
1	Will the US absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the UN resolution /?	US ! country ; UN ! org ;
1	If you look at this UN resolution that 's under debate in New York it does /.	UN ! org ; New York ! country ;
1	it 's a chapter seven resolution so it has the effect of compulsory behavior by all the member states /.	chapter seven ! law ;
1	It says that what the North Koreans did was a threat to international peace and security /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	It does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	That strikes us as an obvious point /.	end
1	And I think what we have to do we 'll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /.	the next couple of days ! date ;
1	we 'll have to see how the Chinese and Russians react to this /.	Chinese ! national ; Russians ! national ;
1	but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of China and Russia 's of South Korea Japan and the United States to force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.	five ! num ; China ! country ; Russia ! country ; South Korea Japan ! country ; the United States ! country ; the North Koreans ! country ;

1	there are many as you know Mister Ambassador who believe the North Koreans did this launch on the fourth of July to get our attention Because they saw the way we were treating Iran differently than we were treating North Korea /.	the North Koreans ! national ; the fourth of July ! date ; Iran ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	Here 's one Nicholas Burns on National Public Radio /.	Nicholas Burns ! person ; National Public Radio ! org ;
1	With Iran the United States has made an offer /.	Iran the United States ! country ;
1	and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in Iran /.	Iranians ! national ; Iran ! country ;
1	Why not sit down in the same way with North Koreans Say to them stop developing your program /.	North Koreans ! national ;
1	and we 'll sit down with you one on one /.	one ! num ; one ! num ;
1	Well Tim we 're trying to sit down with the North Koreans in the context of the six party talks /.	Tim ! person ; the North Koreans ! national ; six ! num ;
1	We 've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for North Korea to return to these talks /.	months ! date ; North Korea ! country ;
1	but we really do n't see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the United States and North Korea /.	two ! num ; the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	The fact is that China has the same interest as the United States /.	China ! country ; the United States ! country ;
1	It should have the same interest /.	end
1	And that is to stop the North Korea nuclear program /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	Our allies Japan and South Korea have the same interests /.	Japan ! country ; South Korea ! country ;
1	and the Russians do as well /.	Russians ! national ;
1	And so we think we 're far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on North Korea of all these different countries /.	six ! num ; North Korea ! country ;
1	I simply do n't see why it 's in the interest of the United States to get those countries out of the way and only deal with North Korea directly /.	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the United States and North Korea /.	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	We 're perfectly willing to sit down with them in that six party environment /.	six ! num ;
1	and in that sense it 's analogous to what we 're trying to do with Iran /.	Iran ! country ;
1	Secretary Rice announced about a month ago that should the Iranians meet the condition of suspension of their own nuclear activities we 'd be willing to sit down in another multilateral forum /.	Rice ! person ; about a month ago ! date ; Iranians ! national ;
1	and that 's with the Europeans and Russians and Chinese /.	Europeans ! national ; Russians ! national ; Chinese ! national ;
1	So really you know the North Korea problem is not a problem just for the United States /.	North Korea ! country ; the United States ! country ;
1	What they did the other day on July fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the Asian countries /.	the other day ! date ; July fourth ! date ; Asian ! location ;
1	And the Asian countries want to be involved in these negotiations /.	Asian ! location ;
1	Is it the policy of the Bush administration that we 'd like to see regime change in North Korea /?	Bush ! person ; North Korea ! country ;
1	Well this is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /.	one ! num ;
1	it 's a major human rights violator /.	end
1	There 's massive famine /.	end
1	And certainly we hope for the day will come when those people will live in peace and be governed by a different type of government /.	end
1	Uh what we 've got to do now of course is focus on the most immediate problem /.	end
1	And that problem is nuclear weapons /.	end
1	The problem is the ballistic launches of the other day /.	the other day ! date ;
1	I think the thing to remember about those launches by the way they were provocative , they were reckless , they were also unsuccessful /.	end
1	They fired four scud missiles intermediate range missiles /.	four ! num ;
1	They tried to fire the longer range missile the /.	end
1	and that was spectacularly unsuccessful /.	end
1	It crashed in the sea of Japan /.	the sea of Japan ! location ;
1	So we obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . And an opportunity to use the combined strength of all these countries to provide some leverage put some leverage against the North Koreans /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	and that 's what we will continue to try to do in the coming days and coming weeks /.	coming days ! date ; coming weeks ! date ;
1	Will the United States give North Korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime /?	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	If you look back at this historic agreement that was signed in the six party frameworks on September nineteenth of two thousand five those types of assurances are in that agreement /.	six ! num ; September nineteenth of two thousand five ! date ;
1	But the North Koreans have obligations /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	and that is to take down their nuclear program dismantle it dismantle their weapons of mass destruction programs in a verifiable way before all those assurances can go into place /.	end
1	All the other elements of the agreement can be put into place /.	end
1	And what we 've seen since then is we 've seen the United States and Russia and China and Japan and South Korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to Tim /.	the United States ! country ; Russia ! country ; China ! country ; Japan ! country ; South Korea ! country ; Tim ! person ;
1	but we see the North Koreans walking away from it /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	So we 've got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with these other countries to pressure the North Koreans to live up to their commitments /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	But we would be willing to give North Korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated /?	North Korea ! country ;
1	The North Koreans know what 's in the September nineteenth agreement /.	The North Koreans ! national ; September nineteenth ! date ;
1	and it 's very specific about what the United States is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction /.	the United States ! country ;
1	But they 've got responsibilities in this agreement /.	end
1	and no agreement is whole until both sides meet their agreement /.	end
1	And what we 've seen Tim especially on July Fourth is the North Koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last September /.	July Fourth ! date ; the North Koreans ! national ; last September ! date ;
1	Why do you think the North Koreans chose July Fourth /?	the North Koreans ! national ; July Fourth ! date ;
1	Oh I do n't think it was coincidental /.	end
1	You know it 's a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /.	end
1	The last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make /.	end
1	but they certainly chose that to get our attention and that of the international community /.	end
1	Uh but what they 've got to realize is there is no magic bullet here /.	end
1	They ca n't just think that they can sit down with the United States alone /.	the United States ! country ;
1	That does n't work for Japan /.	Japan ! country ;
1	it does n't work with South Korea /.	South Korea ! country ;
1	and frankly it does n't work with the Chinese /.	Chinese ! national ;
1	So I said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this Chinese delegation going to /.	Chinese ! national ;
1	And Chris Hill our ambassador was in China a few days ago /.	Chris Hill ! person ; China a few days ago ! country ;
1	he made the point and Secretary Rice made the point yesterday to the Chinese Foreign minister , we want to see China use its influence /.	Rice ! person ; Chinese ! national ; China ! country ;
1	We want to see China push forward and ask the North Koreans to meet these commitments that they 've made to all of us /.	China ! country ; the North Koreans ! national ;

1	For thirteen years the United States has talked loudly about a North Korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat /.	thirteen years the United States ! date ; North Korea ! country ;
1	For thirteen years the North Korean dictatorship has lied and hunkered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /.	thirteen years ! date ; North Korean ! national ;
1	The strategy of talking has failed /.	end
1	America 's actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little /.	America ! country ;
1	It is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments /.	end
1	But the time for talk is over /.	end
1	either they dismantle the missile /.	end
1	or we the United States should dismantle it /.	the United States ! country ;
1	Well uh with all due respect to Speaker Gingrich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success /.	Gingrich ! person ;
1	And you never want to disavow a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion /.	end
1	And as I said before we are not alone in this endeavor /.	end
1	we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure /.	end
1	I will say this what the North Koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system /.	the North Koreans ! national ; the past week ! date ;
1	You 've seen very strong statements by the Japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm /.	Japanese ! national ;
1	So obviously we 're going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the North Koreans on their obligations To pressure them to come back to the talks But also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in Asia /.	the coming weeks ! date ; the North Koreans ! national ; Asia ! location ;
1	And I think you 'll see us move ahead smartly in that direction as well /.	end
1	Uh Mister Ambassador many critics will say the six years George Bush has been president North Korea 's program has developed rather dramatically That the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n't worked /.	the six years George Bush ! date ; North Korea 's ! person ; first ! country ; six ! order ;
1	Here 's the latest study from the Institute for Science and International Security /.	the Institute for Science and International Security ! org ;
1	They estimated a report that North Korea has enough separated plutonium to develop now an arsenal of four to thirteen nuclear weapons compared with estimates of just one or two weapons in two thousand when George bush became president /.

1	although the Bush administration 's rhetoric about Kim Jong - Il and his regime has sometimes seemed ferocious North Korea 's leaders seem to have concluded that the Bush North Korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously /.

1	By more than one criteria indeed strategic successes on the Bush watch outshine those from its during the Clinton years /.	one ! num ; Bush ! person ; Clinton ! person ;
1	Would you acknowledge a significant increase in the nuclear capability by North Korea on the watch of President Bush /?	North Korea ! country ; Bush ! person ;
1	Tim um obviously we profoundly disagree with um some of the statements that we 've just heard /.	Tim ! person ;
1	Eh you know we 've got a very strong military force and deterrent force at work in Asia and particularly on the Korean peninsula /.	Asia ! location ; the Korean peninsula ! location ;
1	And that military can handle any contingency that should arise /.	end
1	We also have a very tough policy and I think forward looking policy to develop missile defense to handle those contingencies /.	end
1	But you 've got to combine military measures with diplomacy to be effective in a situation like this /.	end
1	The fact is that a lot of this criticism seems to direct the United States back to a test of wills bilaterally between North Korea and the United States /.	the United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ; the United States ! country ;
1	What we want to do is we want to ask countries that do have a great deal of influence on North Korea certainly more than we have to use that influence /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	We can do that by channeling those efforts through the six party framework /.	six ! num ;
1	And you know diplomacy sometimes ca n't succeed in a day or two or a week or two /.	a day or two ! date ; a week or two ! date ;
1	Sometimes it takes many months or even years to succeed /.	many months ! date ; years ! date ;
1	But if you have the right policy in place , if you know what you 're trying to accomplish and if you 're very tough - minded about applying that policy we can be successful /.	end
1	So we have not given up hope that we can engineer a policy that will effectively put the North Koreans back in the box take away their nuclear programs and take away their ability to inflict threats and damage on their neighbors /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	We have got to be single - minded about this /.	end
1	we certainly understand the gravity of a challenge posed by North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	but frankly I do n't think these critics have offered any alternative that would have a reasonable prospect of success or lead us to unintended consequences uh if you went down the road that some of them are suggesting /.	end
1	And we think we 've got the right policy in place /.	end
1	and I can assure you we 're going to drive with a great deal of energy and determination /.	end
1	But you do not deny that North Korea 's nuclear capability has increased during the presidency of George Bush /?	North Korea 's ! country ; George Bush ! person ;
1	Well North Korea says that it has a nuclear weapons capability /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	and we believe that it has produced that over the last several years /.	the last several years ! date ;
1	and that 's why we 've put in place this policy designed to take it away from them /.	end
1	And if we can have the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement implemented it will do just that /.	September nineteenth two thousand five ! date ;
1	It will effectively de-nuclearize North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	And so that is a good bet for the United States /.	the United States ! country ;
1	It 's obviously the goal that I think all these critics that you cite would share /.	end
1	But we think we 've got a much more realistic in the real world strategy put in place to deal with that problem /.	end
1	But there has been a profound change in the rhetoric certainly of the President on this subject /.	end
1	Here 's the President Friday at this news conference in Chicago about North Korea /.	Friday ! date ; Chicago ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	It takes a while for a problem to fester and grow /.	end
1	and then it takes a while to solve them diplomatically /.	end
1	It just 's the nature of diplomacy /.	end

1	And let me go back to January of two thousand two in the President 's axis of evil speech before congress /.	January of two thousand two ! date ; congress ! org ;
1	Let 's watch /.	end
1	North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction While starving its citizens /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world /.	end
1	By seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger /.	end
1	We 'll be deliberate /.	end
1	yet time is not on our side /.	end
1	I will not wait on events while dangers gather /.	end
1	I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer /.	end
1	The United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons /.	The United States of America ! country ;
1	Since the President uttered those words Mister Ambassador every estimate is that North Korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	And yet we 've driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the President talked about back in two thousand two /.	two thousand two ! date ;
1	But he has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /.	end
1	We have to try to draw a net around the fact that North Korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world The proliferator of it /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	we 've done a lot to develop missile defense /.	end
1	And we 've created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying North Korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	So we have been very activist /.	end
1	We have followed this policy for a number of years /.	a number of years ! date ;
1	Uh the President is right /.	end
1	And as I said before diplomacy ca n't be measured in a snapshot /.	end
1	You ca n't just say in a Sunday morning in July that somehow because we have n't come to the end of negotiations these negotiations are bound to fail /.	a Sunday morning ! time ; July ! date ;
1	You 've got to be very purposeful and directed in what you 're trying to do and apply the weight of your country and that of others to the test /.	end
1	And that 's what we 're doing /.	end
1	We have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the North Koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the United States /.	the North Koreans ! national ; the United States ! country ;
1	But again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.	end
1	Let me go back and review some of the things the President has said about Kim Jong - Il of North Korea /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ; North Korea ! country ;
1	I loathe Kim Jong - Il /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
1	I got a visceral reaction to this guy /.	end
1	And then in two thousand four there 's a tyrant in North Korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /.	two thousand four ! date ; North Korea ! country ;
1	And then this in two thousand two /.	two thousand two ! date ;
1	the President called him a pygmy And compared him to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.	end
1	Does the President still believe that Kim Jong - Il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
1	Kim Jong - Il is a despot /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
1	And he is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /.	end
1	Uh these missile tests the other day were certainly reckless /.	the other day ! date ;
1	They were provocative /.	end
1	And so uh we have n't changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	No one in our government has /.	end
1	We are very clear - eyed about who they are , what they represent , how much they 've denied their own people the basic human rights that people should have around the world /.	end
1	And we 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.	end
1	So I think there 's been a lot of continuity over American policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we 've talked about North Korea over the last several years /.	American ! national ; North Korea ! country ; the last several years ! date ;
1	And uh we 're determined to press ahead /.	end
1	When the president talked about the axis of evil he said Iraq North Korea and Iran /.	Iraq North Korea ! country ; Iran ! country ;
1	The United States invaded one of those countries Iraq /.	The United States ! country ; one ! num ; Iraq ! country ;
1	Some now make the case that Iran and North Korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the US /.	Iran ! country ; North Korea ! country ; US ! country ;
1	And both of those countries have clearly miscalculated their own situation /.	end
1	Now the North Koreans felt I guess that by testing these ballistic missiles they would somehow put themselves in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	They 've miscalculated because you 've seen very tough statements from the Chinese and the Russians and the South Koreans and the Japanese against what they 've done /.	Chinese ! national ; Russians ! national ; the South Koreans ! national ; Japanese ! national ;
1	and you see momentum building in the UN security council toward a very tough chapter seven resolution against them /.	UN ! org ; chapter seven ! law ;

1	They thought that they could divide the United States from both our European allies and from Russia and China /.	the United States ! country ; European ! national ; Russia ! country ; China ! country ;
1	But we 've been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /.	end
1	And we 've essentially given the Iranians a clear choice /.	Iranians ! national ;
1	And you 'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in Europe when Secretary Rice meets with her counterparts on Wednesday at the GA summit in St. Petersburgh At the end of the week when the president is there /.	this week ! date ; Europe ! location ; Rice ! person ; Wednesday ! date ; St. Petersburgh ! country ; the end of the week ! date ;
1	the Iranians are going to have to choose /.	Iranians ! national ;
1	Negotiations with us after they suspend their nuclear programs or further action in the Security Council /.	the Security Council ! org ;
1	So I do n't think either of these countries is on the offensive /.	end
1	Frankly I think both of these countries are rather cornered and isolated /.	end
1	There are very few countries defending them /.	end
1	and they 're running out of options /.	end
1	So we think this policy of patient diplomacy and of crafting multilateral coalitions to tighten the pressure around them is going to work /.	end
1	And it 's the right way to go clearly for the United States /.	the United States ! country ;
1	we want to exhaust diplomatic means before we consider other means /.	end
1	Based on our experience in Iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize John Deutch the former head of the CIA offered this observation /.	Iraq ! country ; John Deutch ! person ; CIA ! org ;
1	the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example North Korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	Do you agree with that /?	end
1	I do n't /.	end
1	not in the case of North Korea not in the case of Iran /.	North Korea ! country ; Iran ! country ;

1	There is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries Iran and North Korea are trying to do /.	today ! date ; two ! num ; Iran ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	There is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our European allies over Iraq /.	two thousand and two and three ! date ; European ! national ; Iraq ! country ;
1	In fact we are now tightly knit up with these countries /.	end
1	And if you look at what the French German and British governments are saying as well as the Russian and Chinese governments about whether or not these countries are intending to create a nuclear weapons capability they agree with our assessment /.	French German ! national ; British ! national ; Russian ! national ; Chinese ! national ;
1	So I do n't agree at all that we 're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over WMD in Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;

1	Let 's go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place /.	six ! num ; first ! order ;
1	The reason to have everybody at the table with the North Koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with North Korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension /.	the North Koreans ! national ; North Korea ! country ;
1	And we do n't trade with North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	we do n't recognize North Korea diplomatically /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	uh there 's almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;

1	It is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically /.	end

1	The six party talks I totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quadrupling of the amount of plutonium as ambassador Richardson said um in North Korean hands and now missile launches /.	six ! num ; Richardson ! person ; North Korean ! national ;

1	uh they 've shown the carrots /.	end

1	I think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the North Koreans /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	And our government I believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps /.	the last few years ! date ; six ! num ; two ! num ;
1	One camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with North Korea /.	One ! num ; North Korea ! country ;

1	I do n't agree with that view because I think it 's more immoral to let North Korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ; North Korea ! country ;

1	In hindsight do you still stand by that preemptive military strike /?	end
1	Well I do /.	end
1	and I want to put that in some context /.	end
1	By the way I would say we should have that same position today That is if the North Koreans go out to the launch pad and erect that missile and prepare to launch it we can destroy that uh before they can do it /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	To do so would be a very limited military action a single bomb a single cruise missile /.	end
1	the north Koreans are n't going to start a war in response uh to that kind of action /.	the north Koreans ! national ;

1	I think if we are seriously attacked or threatened , that missile which was a test was geared to the United States or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with South Korea or Japan /. /.	the United States ! country ; South Korea ! country ; Japan ! country ;
1	Uh you do take that step /.	end
1	but the fact is that you risk uh the uh North Koreans shooting missiles at South Korea /.	North Koreans ! national ; South Korea ! country ;
1	and we 've got thirty seven thousand American forces at the DMZ /.	thirty seven thousand American ! num ;
1	Uh but Tim I think another reason for the face to face talks is that there 're two issues that are separate from the six party talks that are a serious grievance in our relationship /.	Tim ! person ; two ! num ; six ! num ;
1	one is the fact that we have frozen financial assets of the North Koreans /.	one ! num ; the North Koreans ! national ;
1	I believe rightly so /.	end

1	The second is our objection to dealing with North Koreans ' request for a light water reactor Which I believe has bogged down the six party talks /.	second ! order ; North Koreans ' ! national ; six ! num ;
1	Which by the way I believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the United States and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the South Koreans and the Japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives /.	the United States ! country ; six ! num ; the South Koreans ! national ; Japanese ! national ;
1	So you ca n't cut them out /.	end
1	but I think it 's essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between United States and North Korea /.	United States ! country ; North Korea ! country ;
1	But in the end it 's a judgment of North Korean intentions /.	North Korean ! national ;
1	You 'd been there five times /.	five ! num ;
1	you know them /.	end
1	and yet a few weeks before the missile launch you said I do n't think they 're going to test /.	a few weeks ! date ;
1	And they did /.	end
1	No Tim I said I believe that they were going to test /.	Tim ! person ;
1	I did say that /.	end
1	And what I sense in my negotiations in dealing with North Koreans /-	North Koreans ! national ;
1	You said as days go by I do n't believe they 're going to do it /.	days ! date ;
1	But early on I said that they did on CBS /.	CBS ! org ;
1	Uh my point is that when you deal with North Korea you 're not dealing with individuals like you and me /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	Do n't believe in compromise /.	end
1	they believe in their only way or the highway /.	end
1	Their view is that their cause is right /.	end
1	and they 're going to wait you out /.	end
1	So they 're totally unpredictable /.	end
1	and I believe the only way to deal with them and we have shown that effectively in past dealings with the Clinton Administration is direct engagement To get them to curb their nuclear weapons as Bob Gallucci did /.	Clinton ! person ; Bob Gallucci ! person ;
1	Secretary Albright almost got a missile agreement /.	Albright ! person ;

1	No what they were doing uh as it turns out , they were cheating /.	end
1	and the reason that you have arms control agreements is that you do n't make them with your friends , you make them with your enemies /.	end

1	but we later found out that at the same time they were making uranium in another plant /.	end
1	Not actually /.	end
1	No that 's not what we found out /.	end
1	What happened was we did do a deal /.	end
1	We did stop a uh plutonium based pro-nuclear weapons program /.	end
1	We made sure that eight thousand fuel rods containing around thirty kilograms enough for five nuclear weapons worth of plutonium stayed in a storage pond /.	eight thousand ! num ; around thirty kilograms ! measure ; five ! num ;
1	And the deal would have had the North Koreans end their nuclear weapons program /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	We think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from Pakistan /.	the late nineties ! date ; Pakistan ! country ;
1	We do n't know a lot about that where it is whether the equipment has been put together /.	end
1	We think over a period of time they 'll do what the Pakistanis did , what the Iranians appear to be wanting to do and put together this gas centrifuge /.	Pakistanis ! national ; Iranians ! national ;
1	But they never got there yet /.	end
1	Or we do n't think they 've gotten there yet /.	end
1	But they broke their word /.	end
1	They absolutely cheated /.	end
1	There 's no question about that /.	end
1	But really you ought to be clear here what 's happened /.	end
1	There was a nuclear weapons program that was stopped /.	end
1	Plutonium production was stopped /.	end
1	Right /.	end
1	And afterwards tragically I believe that agreement which locked them up was allowed to collapse /.	end
1	And we find ourselves now with the North Koreans accumulating plutonium a bomb 's worth a year /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	And freed up that plutonium that was um controlled for that period of time /.	end
1	And they say they 've used it to make bombs /.	end
1	we 'd have to estimate about five more /.	five ! num ;
1	And with each passing day I would argue to you more important than that missile that Ash would take out on the gantry if it turns up again with each passing day we 're going to find ourselves more and more closer than we were before to the day where that material could be transferred or sold to Al - Queda Presenting a threat far greater than the threat that is posed to us by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /.	each passing day ! date ; Ash ! person ; the day ! date ;
1	We can deter a country with ballistic missiles /.	end

1	We do /.	end
1	But with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against United Airlines or American Airlines Or a bus or a truck /.	United Airlines ! org ; American Airlines ! org ;
1	And deterrents does n't work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than his life /.	end
1	So no defense no deterrents /.	end
1	we need to lock up the nuclear program /.	end
1	You would not care about the ballistic missile program if they did not have the nuclear weapons program /.	end
1	But you can have all the agreements you want /.	end
1	if they 're going to cheat what good are they /?	end
1	Madeline Albright essentially had it correct in my view /.	Madeline Albright ! person ;
1	You make a deal /.	end

1	President Clinton President Bush /.	Clinton ! person ; Bush ! person ;
1	North Korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	We had to be very firm about it /.	end
1	We will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	Ash Carter both presidents making very firm resolved statements /.	Ash Carter ! person ;
1	if you 're in North Korean watching that knowing that you now have the potential of building eight nuclear bombs what are you thinking /?	North Korean ! national ; eight ! num ;
1	Well I 'm concerned that they 're thinking that we 're giving a new meaning to the word intolerable Because they keep doing things that we say are intolerable and then we tolerate them /.	end
1	That 's why I think at some point you have to draw the line with the North Koreans /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	I do think and here I agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it 's possible to reach an agreement with North Korea and to get agreements that serve our interests The much maligned agreed framework as Bob Galluci pointed out without that agreed framework North Korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /.	North Korea ! country ; Bob Galluci ! person ; North Korea ! country ; fifty ! num ;
1	So we were better off with the agreement than without it /.	end
1	It is possible to reach agreement with the North Koreans But not when they see the kind of footage that you uh showed Which is uh uh uh Americans drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back from that line And drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back /.	the North Koreans ! national ; Americans ! national ;
1	I think our diplomacy has to have carrots in it but it has to stand somewhere /.	end
1	and as I suggested earlier I think the missile tests are a good place to take a stand /.	end
1	Governor Richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /.	Richardson ! person ;
1	the North Koreans watch that /.	the North Koreans ! national ;
1	they observe that /.	end
1	they know what their own has been /.	end
1	How do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /?	end
1	The North Koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /.	The North Koreans ! national ;
1	In your earlier segment you showed president Bush calling him a tyrant /.	Bush ! person ;
1	But then later he called him Mister Kim Jong - Il /.	Kim Jong - Il ! person ;
1	I was in North Korea when that happened /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	The North Koreans were delighted because they felt they 'd been treated with respect /.	The North Koreans ! national ;
1	They care deeply about protocol /.	end
1	And this is another reason why I think for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of Chris Hill who again is very competent I believe would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks Which is essential Which is basically a good agreement /.	Chris Hill ! person ; six ! num ;
1	In exchange for North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked /.	North Korea ! country ;
1	they get food fuel energy assistance /.	end
1	Security assurances we will not topple their regime /.	end
1	That 's right /.	end
1	yeah that 's right /.	end
1	that 's in that September agreement that Chris Hill negotiated /.	September ! date ; Chris Hill ! person ;
1	My point is if it 's just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the North Korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of Kim Jong - Il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we 've promised it to Iran and economic incentives to Iran I think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation /.	North Korean ! national ; Kim Jong - Il ! person ; Iran ! country ; Iran ! country ;
1	Ambassador Galluci based on your experience do you believe the North Koreans would give up their nuclear program give up their nuclear bombs which they believe in their mind is an insurance policy against an American invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /?	Galluci ! person ; the North Koreans ! national ; American ! national ;
1	At the end of the day I do n't know /.	end
1	Um but that leaves me to conclude since I really do n't know that it 's a good idea to find out /.	end
1	It 's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the North that required them to give up the program /.	nineteen ninety four ! date ; the North ! country ;
1	We did that /.	end
1	and for a period of years we were in a position to monitor that closely /.	a period of years ! date ;
1	and they did give it up /.	end
1	Indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the Pakistanis is clearly cheating was n't yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n't produced anything and probably still has n't produced anything /.	Pakistanis ! national ;
1	So you have the possibility if the North Koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other , they need either nuclear weapons to deter the United States from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons /.	the North Koreans ! national ; one ! num ; the United States ! country ;
1	The only way to find out whether they 'll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /.	end

1	In September 2005 , a study report titled " Concern for Left - behind Children " had drawn wide public attention .	September 2005 ! date ; " Concern for Left - behind Children " ! art ;
1	While the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .	end
1	Ye Jingzhong is the assistant dean of the College of Humanities and Development at China Agricultural University , and team leader of the Left - behind Children Task Force .	Ye Jingzhong ! person ; the College of Humanities and Development ! org ; China Agricultural University ! org ; the Left - behind Children Task Force ! org ;
1	In the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western China , including Shaanxi , Ningxia , Hebei , and Beijing .	the last two years ! date ; China ! country ; Shaanxi ! country ; Ningxia ! country ; Hebei ! country ; Beijing ! country ;
1	Why did you pick the central and western parts of China , and not the south , to conduct this study ?	China ! country ;
1	First of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work .	First ! order ;
1	They are not in a position to bring their children to the city .	end
1	When we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents , work in the city .	end
1	, its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .	end
1	Therefore , we believe that whether it 's in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent .	end
1	According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ?	China ! country ;
1	This group should be the biggest in number .	end
1	Um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .	100 million ! num ;
1	Nowadays , um , , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .	120 million ! num ;
1	Many people quote a figure of 150 million .	150 million ! num ;
1	Let 's think about it this way .	end
1	If we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city .	120 million ! num ; half ! num ;
1	Of course , families of these married people will usually have children .	end
1	Moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .	more than one ! num ;
1	So you can imagine .	end
1	I believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million .	more than 10 or 20 million ! num ;
1	It , uh , , in my opinion , should be around 50 million .	50 million ! num ;
1	Of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations .	end
1	I believe the number of this group should be particularly large .	end
1	According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . Among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .	four ! num ; 79.2 percent ! per ;
1	The next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent . While those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children , respectively .	one ! num ; 16.9 percent ! per ; 4.1 percent ! per ; .9 percent ! per ;
1	According to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ?	end
1	Different types of custody have different impacts on their life .	end
1	No doubt , , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .	end
1	The impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .	end
1	There is no major problem in the children 's material life .	end
1	Of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization .	end
1	The one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .	one ! num ;
1	Skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .	end
1	There is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .	end
1	These three types create the biggest and the most impact .	three ! num ;
1	If we want to discuss this in more detail , let 's say , the skip - generation custody .	end
1	First , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation .	First ! order ;
1	This is indisputable .	end
1	This type of family is not as good as the others .	end
1	We had an example of a child in Shaanxi province .	Shaanxi province ! country ;
1	Um , there was a family !	end
1	This family had an older brother and a younger sister .	end
1	Both parents wanted to go to the city to work .	end
1	The father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too .	first ! order ;
1	What happened to these two children ?	two ! num ;
1	The grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !	end
1	As a result , , this mother sent , these brother and sister , to martial arts school to study .	end
1	After they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .	end
1	She went to visit them .	end
1	When she saw them , , the girl cried to her and said , " I really do n't want to stay here .	end
1	I want to go home . "	end
1	Later , the mother was moved and brought , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .	end
1	Um , she still , ai , left him at the martial arts school .	end
1	Um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .	end
1	When she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl 's body was dotted with red marks and red swellings .	one ! num ;
1	She then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time .	end
1	The situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?	end
1	The situation that I just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common .	end
1	Why is it so ?	end
1	You said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .	end
1	It is true .	end
1	It is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .	end
1	However , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different .	end
1	They are influenced by their own habits .	end
1	For instance , there was a child who was sick .	end
1	Um , the grandparents asked him to take , a small pill that was made in Shaanxi .	Shaanxi ! country ;
1	They did not even know what it was made of .	end
1	It was a local method .	end
1	Um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect .	end
1	Instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by , some habits in this aspect .	end
1	, they raised this point themselves .	end
1	Another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .	end
1	" Her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .	end
1	So , all I can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold . "	end
1	They also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .	end
1	After all , a family that had so many people in the beginning , , the parents of the children were a very important um , workforce .	end
1	Now it was down to the two grandparents .	two ! num ;
1	No doubt , they could not help .	end
1	In the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet .	two ! num ;
1	Farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school .	end
1	Originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education .	end
1	However , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more .	end
1	During this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children .	end
1	This pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious .	end
1	You have seen many kinds of left - behind children .	end
1	Was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?	end
1	, um , there was a child in Ningxia whose name was Yao Zhengang .	Ningxia ! country ; Yao Zhengang ! person ;
1	This child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school .	end
1	What impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents .	end

1	After he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor .	end
1	He just carried him like that without saying a word .	end
1	When the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county .	end
1	When Yao Zhengang told us what happened , he said , " My father had never bought me so many tasty foods before .	Yao Zhengang ! person ;
1	On that day , he bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself . "	that day ! date ;
1	I thought about this at that time .	end
1	After I heard this incident , I particularly understood what was in the mind of Yao Zhengang 's father .	Yao Zhengang 's ! person ;
1	He might have felt especially guilty toward his child .	end
1	What he felt was that " I go out to work and leave my child home . "	end
1	He said that his child had also said , " When he was at home , he always encouraged me . "	end
1	He would say , " No problem . You work hard and get a better grade next time , " when I had low grades .	end
1	If he could receive many , such encouragements , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes .	end
1	He does not want to go to school now .	end
1	However , in his example , I could imagine what went through his father 's mind at that time .	end
1	I think that he felt very guilty toward his child .	end
1	Therefore , I can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative .	end
1	They are forced into making such decisions .	end

1	There was a small finger inside the box .	end
1	This was a very terrifying incident .	end
1	What was the small finger all about ?	end
1	What happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her .	end
1	They had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .	end
1	When she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened .	end
1	Her grandparents said , " We ca n't help .	end
1	We ca n't keep an eye on her all the time . "	end
1	, before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar .	end
1	He had told her not to do that before .	end
1	However , I said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control .	end
1	That was why she turned this way .	end

1	Since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .	end
1	While for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .	end

1	Our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .	end
1	However , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .	approximately 50 percent ! per ; three minutes ! time ;
1	What could they talk about in three minutes ?	three minutes ! time ;
1	I think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes .	three minutes ! time ;
1	Of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations .	three - minute ! time ;
1	What did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?	end
1	What touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children 's conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned .	70 percent ! per ;
1	As for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school .	first ! order ;
1	Whether they were good and how their schoolwork was .	end
1	Second , it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that .	Second ! order ;
1	Uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange .	end
1	We know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange .	end
1	However , the parents may not have realized this .	end
1	For instance , the child has stopped talking .	end
1	He stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .	end
1	The parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately .	end
1	Of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ?	three minutes ! time ; three minutes ! time ;
1	In many cases , it was because they worried about the charge .	end
1	, many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone .	end
1	However , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home .	one ! num ;
1	It was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors .	end
1	Second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call .	Second ! order ;
1	Some children told me , " I secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home . "	end
1	The children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange .	end
1	Do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?	end
1	Um , um , we conducted a survey on this question .	end
1	We were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home .	40 percent ! per ;
1	How could that be possible ?	end
1	How could that be possible ?	end
1	We interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city .	end
1	Why would n't the children know what they did ?	end
1	First , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city .	First ! order ; three - minute ! time ;
1	However , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .	end
1	Thus , I believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job .	end
1	Why do they do that ?	end
1	It is because they are afraid that their children will worry .	end
1	Second , , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children 's mind .	Second ! order ;
1	Maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do .	end

1	Do you still remember your mother 's cooking ?	end
1	Uh huh , I do .	end
1	It was especially tasty .	end
1	Now , the most I want to know is , my parents ' health .	end
1	Why do you want to know about that ?	end
1	It is because I care about my parents very much .	end
1	I think about their work because I know that they work in the city because of me , so I care about them a lot .	end
1	They will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money .	end
1	I believe it is also because of me , so I care about their health a lot .	end
1	Because of you , why is it because of you ?	end
1	Because if they did n't have me , I think they uh , would be a lot more , relaxed when they worked .	end
1	Then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? Or go to the city with them ?	end
1	In regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .	first ! order ;
1	However , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .	51 percent ! per ;
1	However , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .	half ! num ;
1	We also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .	end
1	This was also very surprising to us .	end
1	They said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .	end
1	They were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that .	end
1	Second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city .	Second ! order ;
1	Their parents have to send money home , among other things .	end
1	If they go live with them , they will add more burdens to their parents .	end
1	If we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this .	end
1	As for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear .	end
1	As for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?	end
1	I believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling .	end
1	All parents , I can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children .	end
1	However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem .	end
1	Of course , we know what the reality is .	end
1	First , their families are rather poor to begin with .	First ! order ;
1	Only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city .	end
1	They have to make money to support the family .	end
1	They will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .	end
1	Nonetheless , I believe there are also many other reasons .	end
1	They also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .	end
1	They have to find a place to live .	end
1	All these are problems that they need to resolve .	end
1	The problems they face are too many .	end
1	If the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high .	end
1	Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need .	end
1	Many parents are unable to bring their children with them .	end
1	What would you tell your parents if you could see them now ?	end
1	I want to tell them that I miss them very much .	end
1	Judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ?	end
1	It is hard to tell from the surface .	end
1	Why is it so ?	end
1	For these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city .	end
1	For example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already .	a year ! date ; 10 years ! date ;
1	In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .	end
1	However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .	end
1	They had very strange um , um , temperaments .	end
1	They did not like to speak .	end
1	There was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school .	the first year ! date ;
1	Um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father .	end
1	He was very good at school .	end
1	However , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination .	second ! order ;
1	After that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed .	end
1	Um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange .	end
1	Um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him .	end
1	They said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him .	end
1	Um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .	end
1	However , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development .	end
1	This situation indeed exists .	end
1	After all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete .	end
1	I believe love is especially important .	end
1	Children need love from the time they are small .	end
1	We have to understand our Chinese saying , " The child is father to the man . "	Chinese ! national ;
1	What it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life .	end
1	Only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future .	end
1	This is the case .	end
1	Therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .	end
1	Um , , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home .	end
1	Perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love .	end
1	Under this situation , I believe , I am not sure , um , I am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up .	end
1	Will they believe there is love in society or not ?	end
1	Will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it .	end
1	They have never completely experienced it .	end
1	Thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , I think this is , something that I do not want to imagine .	end
1	Despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require .	end
1	According to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life .	more than half ! num ;
1	58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy .	58 percent ! per ;
1	Are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ?	end
1	Do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ?	end
1	They thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face .	end
1	They were condemned to this reality .	end
1	No doubt , I think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration .	end
1	Why do n't they ?	end
1	I believe people are all the same .	end
1	If they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood .	first ! order ;
1	They can not consider the deeper issue of children 's safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed .	end
1	For example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in Shaanxi province .	two ! num ; Shaanxi province ! country ;
1	Many people whom we interviewed lived in cave dwellings .	end

1	, these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home !	end

1	The family told him that they were fine .	end
1	He did not come back after that .	end
1	He did not come back to check if everything was fine .	end
1	I believe the reason he did not return was that he would ponder whether he should return or not .	end

1	And the question and this is a very serious question it 's not answered in the article /.	end
1	Were editorial higher - ups and were the corporate lawyers at the New York Times in some way leaning on suppressing and distorting the coverage from the news uh section /?	the New York Times ! org ;
1	Arianna Huffington uh in this lengthy piece this morning uh uh Judy Miller is quoted excuse me as saying that there was another source beside Scooter Libby that she dealt with on the Valerie Plame situation /.	Arianna Huffington ! person ; this morning ! time ; Judy Miller ! person ; Scooter Libby ! person ; Valerie Plame ! person ;
1	She does n't recall who that source was looking at her notes and seeing the uh notation Valerie Flame /.	Valerie Flame ! person ;
1	She got the name wrong /.	end
1	Do you buy this notion that she does n't recall who this other source was /?	end
1	No of course not Howie /.	Howie ! person ;
1	In fact I think this is the major unanswered question /.	end
1	We do n't know who eh her source was when it comes to revealing the identity of Valerie Plame /.	Valerie Plame ! person ;
1	And to say that she does not recall is really as convincing as having Woodward and Bernstein saying that they do not recall who Deep Throat was /.	Woodward ! person ; Bernstein ! person ; Deep Throat ! person ;
1	After all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the Valerie Plame Bob Novak column appeared and when the whole Washington and the whole journalistic community was talking about it /.	just a few weeks old ! date ; Valerie Plame Bob Novak ! person ; Washington ! person ;
1	You know I do n't /-	end
1	Incidentally there was some questions uh that Judy Miller would not answer to her colleagues /.	Judy Miller ! person ;
1	and she would n't share her notes with them although they 've been turned over to the special prosecutor /.	end
1	Lucy Dalglish the big news for me was Miller recounting what her lawyer Floyd Abrams had said to her about a conversation that he had with Joe Tate who was Scooter Libby 's lawyer /.	Lucy Dalglish ! person ; Miller ! person ; Floyd Abrams ! person ; Joe Tate ! person ; Scooter Libby 's ! person ;
1	Uh says um Floyd Abrams according to Miller 's account when I would n't give him Tate an assurance that you would exonerate Libby he said do n't go there /.	Floyd Abrams ! person ; Miller ! person ; Tate ! person ; Libby ! person ;
1	Now Tate by the way tells the Times that that account is false and outrageous /.	Tate ! person ; Times ! org ;
1	Does this help justify eh Judy Miller 's otherwise mysterious decision to go to jail and not accept the waiver of confidentiality that Scooter Libby offered and sit in jail for eighty - five days /?	Judy Miller 's ! person ; Scooter Libby ! person ; eighty - five days ! date ;
1	N- you n- /.	end
1	you know I 've been talking to Judy off and on about this case for the last year /.	Judy ! person ; the last year ! date ;
1	This was a very difficult decision /.	end
1	and you know what this all comes down to is you keep your promises when you make a promise to a confidential source /.	end
1	You 'll recall six or eight months ago Howie I was on the show and we were talking about you know did Russert and Kessler and all the rest of those guys did they break some trust by agreeing to testify and observing the waiver /?	six or eight months ago Howie ! date ; Russert ! person ; Kessler ! person ;
1	What I think this situation and the turmoil that is obviously going on at the Times right now points out is the fact that we have a major problem in this country /.	Times ! org ;
1	it 's that reporters believe they need to keep their promises to their sources /.	end
1	Reporters will try to do whatever they can as long as the law allows them to protect those sources /.	end
1	Right /.	end
1	But these days um with the state of our law the fact that we do not have a federal shield law we have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of our newsrooms /.	these days ! date ;

1	I think Lucy 's on to something here if I can just say Howie /.	Lucy ! person ; Howie ! person ;

1	She did n't even report on this /.	end
1	But it does point out a very serious issue /.	end
1	And that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or do n't have and the propensity of uh the United States government to have more secrecy not less /.	United States ! country ;
1	We 've got to figure this out /.	end
1	Well just to clarify uh she did ultimately uh testify about her confidential source /.	end
1	The whole issue was how voluntary was the waiver of her promise to Scooter Libby offered and why was she able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail /.	Libby ! person ;
1	Well exactly /.	end
1	and you know what Howie /. /.	Howie ! person ;
1	it 's really time for Lucy and other Judy Miller defenders to update her talking points because what Lucy just said just simply does not wash /.	Lucy ! person ; Judy Miller ! person ; Lucy ! person ;
1	The truth is that as Howie said she did testify /.	Howie ! person ;
1	The truth is that it 's very clear from the stories today that she could 've asked uh Scooter Libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier /.	today ! date ; Scooter Libby ! person ;
1	All of that could have happened /.	end
1	It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /.	Judy Miller ! person ; American ! national ;

1	Lucy /.	Lucy ! person ;
1	/.	end
1	Let me get a response from Lucy Dalglish /.	Lucy Dalglish ! person ;
1	I think it 's very obvious from what Judy wrote today she is protecting somebody else /.	Judy ! person ; today ! date ;
1	And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was she negotiating what she was going to say about Scooter Libby but you got to keep in mind I 'm a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /.	one ! num ; Scooter Libby ! person ;
1	They had to negotiate with Patrick Fitzgerald what he would not talk about /.	Patrick Fitzgerald ! person ;
1	They also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contacting /.	end
1	Once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful /.	end
1	You do n't mess with the Feds /.	end
1	It 's very clear in her story that she decided finally to testify because she got tired of jail because she was threatened with criminal contempt charges because she wanted to go out and now she 's saying admitting finally write a book /.	end
1	All these things are there in black and white /.	end
1	and to continue to portray her as a martyr is not going to work /.	end
1	And on that point Arianna on that point she says sh- /-	Arianna ! person ;
1	Excuse me /.	end

1	Do you think she 'll ever come back /?	end
1	You think she 's saving it for the book /?	end
1	Well it 's very clear that she would not be welcome in the newsroom /.	end
1	And it 's very clear eh as I reported again that when Bill Keller took her off her WMD beat they were all hoping she would resign /.	Bill Keller ! person ;
1	Instead she threw a fit /.	end
1	but she stayed on /.	end
1	This is not a journalism one oh one course the way she handled both the WMD reporting and Plame Gate /.	one oh one ! num ; Plame Gate ! thing ;

1	Jump in /.	end
1	And Howie I 'll tell you what /.	Howie ! person ;
1	This is a gigantic shot across the bow of every manager in the news business and every editor and every executive producer anywhere because you got to have some uh control some connection with your correspondants and your reporters /.	end
1	You got to know who they 're talking to at some level anyway because you know what /?	end
1	It 's about trust with the public /.	end

1	Well not just Rove though /.	Rove ! person ;
1	what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that Fitzgerald is after the whole Iraq White House group the group that uh in Cheney 's office with Libby and Rove and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the American public based on lies /.

1	The fact of the matter is that Karl Rove has been to the grand jury four times /.	Karl Rove ! person ; four ! num ;
1	The fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in Washington and believe me they 're not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted /.	Washington ! country ;

1	I was very disappointed that the political leadership of the United States uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them /.	the United States ! country ; nineteen ! num ;
1	to give that order to the director because that 's the order that I got and then to do nothing to assist and facilitate that investigation in fact to undermine it /.	end
1	The Clinton people were furious at the way Sixty Minutes hailed the segment /.	Clinton ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! org ;
1	and here to talk back is former Clinton White House attorney Lanny Davis /.	Clinton White House ! person ; Lanny Davis ! org ;
1	Welcome /.	end
1	Let 's deal with the substance first /.	first ! order ;
1	Louis Freeh says that when Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah in nineteen ninety - eight , he did n't press for FBI access to suspects in the Khobar Towers bombing and he hit up the prince for a contribution to his presidential library /.	Louis Freeh ! person ; Clinton ! person ; Crown Prince Abdullah ! person ; nineteen ninety - eight ! date ; FBI ! org ; Khobar Towers ! fact ;
1	Well not only is that false and President Clinton has said so but everybody who attended the meeting not including Louis Freeh says it 's false /.	Clinton ! person ; Louis Freeh ! person ;
1	And my problem with Sixty Minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /.	end
1	Until Friday afternoon we did n't even know the charge was being made /.	Friday afternoon ! time ;
1	And even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict Mister Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
1	Sixty Minutes says Bill Clinton was offered a chance to come on and give his rebuttal /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ; Bill Clinton ! person ;
1	What 's wrong with that /?	end
1	Well first of all it 's absolutely amazing that Sixty Minutes thinks it 's okay to air a false and malicious statement /.	first ! order ; Sixty Minutes ! org ;
1	This is a terrible charge that an FBI investigation was thwarted because President Clinton wanted to receive money for his library /.	FBI ! org ; Clinton ! person ;
1	The charge was false /.	end
1	and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the United States /?	the United States ! country ;
1	What about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /?	end
1	What about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /?	end
1	That 's my problem /.	end
1	What about Sandy Berger the former national security advisor under President Clinton /?	Sandy Berger ! person ; Clinton ! person ;
1	He was at the meeting /.	end
1	He was in the room /.	end
1	Did you offer him for an on - camera interview /?	end
1	Well on Friday afternoon /.	Friday afternoon ! time ;
1	You were n't there /.	end
1	I was not there /.	end
1	You 're good on television /.	end
1	but you were n't there /.	end
1	uh I talked to Sandy Berger /.	Sandy Berger ! person ;
1	We issued a statement from Mister Berger /.	Berger ! person ;
1	but this was Friday afternoon when we first learned about it with Sunday broadcast /.	Friday afternoon ! time ; first ! order ; Sunday ! date ;
1	Why did n't Sixty Minutes invite Mister Berger or other people at the meeting before Friday afternoon /?	Sixty Minutes ! org ; Berger ! person ; Friday afternoon ! time ;
1	Why did it take us to get Sixty Minutes to do basic reporting to verify facts /?	Sixty Minutes ! org ;
1	It 's not enough to have Louis Freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /.	Louis Freeh ! person ;
1	That 's poor journalism /.	end
1	On that point let me read a statement from a Sixty Minutes spokesman /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ;
1	And this involves uh their saying that they contacted Clinton 's office back in August with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the President 's people said he did not want to be interviewed /.	Clinton ! person ; August ! date ;
1	They gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until Lanny Davis launched his PR campaign on the Thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack Freeh rather than deal with his allegations /.	Lanny Davis ! person ; the Thursday before the broadcast ! date ; Freeh ! person ;
1	Denials from President Clinton and Sandy Berger that did deal with Freeh 's allegations were included in the Sixty Minutes report /.	Clinton ! person ; Sandy Berger ! person ; Freeh ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! art ;
1	Well first of all it 's false to say that I was asking to disparage Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
1	I was asking to talk about facts that Freeh was saying that were not true /.	Freeh ! person ;
1	You do n't mind disparaging Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
1	my observation /.	end
1	no in fact I disparage any man who as FBI director has a personal pique rather than doing his job /.	FBI ! org ;
1	That 's disparaging /.	end
1	Secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /.	Secondly ! order ; just the week before ! date ;
1	When Mister Carson the representative spoke to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace agreed that they had never verified what Mister uh Freeh had said /.	Carson ! person ; Wallace ! person ; Wallace ! person ; Freeh ! person ;
1	They never talked to Mister Freeh /.	Freeh ! person ;
1	and in fact it was n't until that Friday that we learned the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges /.	that Friday ! date ; Freeh ! person ;
1	So Sixty Minutes I think has just said something that is false /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ;
1	When did the Clinton team find out that Sixty Minutes was going to report that Louis Freeh with his new book was going to have a specific allegation about Clinton 's handling of the Khobar Towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /.	Clinton ! person ; Sixty Minutes ! org ; Louis Freeh ! person ; Khobar Towers ! fact ;
1	When somebody named Howard Kurtz wrote a story in the Washington Post on Friday morning is the first time that the Clinton forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that Mister Freeh made a false charge /.	Howard Kurtz ! person ; the Washington Post ! org ; Friday morning ! time ; first ! order ; Clinton ! person ; Freeh ! person ;
1	And even since that interview Mister Freeh has backed off and has not told people who his source is /.	Freeh ! person ;
1	and he has n't even insisted that it was true /.	end
1	He just said somebody told him it was true /.	end

1	That 's false /.	end
1	Are you saying that 's false /?	end
1	They were never told /. /.	end

1	Jay Carson is the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton /.	Jay Carson ! person ; Bill Clinton ! person ;
1	Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true /.	Jay Carson ! person ; Clinton ! person ; the Khobar Towers ! fact ;
1	President Clinton at that uh meeting did press the uh Crown Prince to cooperate with the FBI /.	Clinton ! person ; FBI ! org ;
1	so what Mister Freeh said was false /.	Freeh ! person ;
1	That was not understood by the Clinton people until it was read in the Washington Post in the story that you wrote because Sixty Minutes put a press release out /.	Clinton ! person ; the Washington Post ! org ; Sixty Minutes ! org ;
1	Uh now look Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes gave Bill Clinton one hour last year to push his own ten million dollar autobiography /.	Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes ! person ; Bill Clinton one hour last year ! org ; ten million dollar ! person ;
1	He criticized people /.	end
1	He criticized Ken Starr /.	Ken Starr ! person ;

1	Let 's ask a Sixty Minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former FBI director as whether it 's true or not /.	Sixty Minutes ! org ; FBI ! org ;
1	Is it good enough to air it just because he says it /.	end
1	or should you do reporting /?	end
1	Good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton /.	Clinton ! person ;
1	Let 's see whether it 's true and start making phone calls /.	end
1	They did not do that /.	end

1	The Iraq story which the media has placed on the back burner in recent months is simmering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted /.	Iraq ! country ; yesterday ! date ;
1	But are journalists getting the real story there /?	end
1	To help us scrutinize the coverage I sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times three time Pulitzer winner Tom Friedman and the author most recently of The World is Flat /.	the New York Times three ! org ; Pulitzer ! num ; Tom Friedman ! art ; The World is Flat ! person ;
1	Tom Friedman welcome /.	Tom Friedman ! person ;
1	Good to be here Howie /.	Howie ! person ;
1	thank you /.	end
1	The other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the New York Times you would 've led the paper with the news of recent days that a Sunni suicide bomber on Ramadan had attacked a Shiite mosque /.	The other day ! date ; the New York Times ! org ; Sunni ! national ; Ramadan ! date ; Shiite ! national ;
1	Now in reality the world that you do n't rule New York Times Washington Post made that part of a larger story on Iraq /.	New York Times Washington Post ! org ; Iraq ! org ;
1	Uh nobody put it on the front page /.	end
1	Bad news judgement /?	end
1	Uh I think so Howie /.	Howie ! person ;
1	I 'm not here to make a news point though /.	end
1	I 'm really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism /.	end
1	I 'm a firm believer /.	end
1	How we ever going to win this war /?	end
1	We 're never going to win it by way of American intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist /.	American ! national ;
1	We get lucky every once in a while /.	end
1	but there 's only {one?} way we win this war Howie is it takes a village /.	Howie ! person ;
1	It only happens when the Sunni Muslim world basically turns people in and when the Sunni Muslim world restrains their own /.	Sunni Muslim ! national ; Sunni Muslim ! national ;
1	And what was so shocking to me about this story a Sunni Jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of Ramadan /.	Sunni Jihadi ! national ; number one ! num ; the first day of Ramadan ! date ;
1	What that tells you is that there 's no controlling moral authority today in the Sunni Muslim world /.	today ! date ; Sunni Muslim ! national ;
1	Well what is the bigger story /?	end
1	And that is a huge story /.	end
1	I think it should have been a big story /.	end
1	Why was n't /-	end
1	Is it because of Iraq fatigue /?	Iraq ! country ;
1	Um /.	end
1	I think it is yeah /.	end
1	Think it 's /-	end
1	Are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed twenty killed fifteen killed /.	another day ! date ; ten ! num ; twenty ! num ; fifteen ! num ;
1	and it does n't rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page /?	end
1	Right /.	end
1	Yeah and I think that 's right /.	end
1	There is Iraq fatigue /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	And there 's so much fatigue that we do n't sit back and say wait a minute /.	a minute ! time ;
1	what happened today /?	today ! date ;
1	A Sunni Muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of Ramadan their holiest day /.	Sunni Muslim ! national ; the first day of Ramadan ! date ;
1	and no one says boo /.	end
1	this is civilization that when we accidentally or deliberately I do n't know abused the Koran people rioted in Pakistan /.	Koran ! art ; Pakistan ! country ;
1	Yet their own houses of worship and holidays are being defiled /.	end
1	And I think it is a measure of how much we 've kind of lost been numbed by all of this that we do n't sit back and say wow wait a minute /.	a minute ! time ;
1	that really crosses the line /.	end
1	and we have to call them on it even if they do n't /.	end
1	You 're recently back from Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	and you write about driving in from Kuwait /.	Kuwait ! country ;
1	You were guarded by the US navy /.	US ! country ;
1	and yet it was kind of a harrowing experience /.	end
1	Why so /?	end
1	Um you know the south of Iraq which is where I was the area around /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	This is the safe part /.	end
1	Right exactly /.	end
1	I was in the safe district /.	end
1	I was guarded uh by the British Royal Marines actually because unfortunately they 've had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /.	the British Royal Marines ! org ;
1	And it 's part of the general continuing insecurity of Iraq that um I 'm afraid has plagued this story from the very beginning /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	And it 's been I 've always felt the Achille 's heel /.	Achille ! person ;
1	You know my criticism of the Bush administration as you know we 've talked about this before is not that this war is not important /.	Bush ! person ;
1	I believe it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized /.	end
1	But it 's so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge /.	end
1	And on that trip you put on body armor /.	end
1	their rifles were out /.	end
1	Yeah /.	end
1	Um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /?	end
1	You 're there /.	end
1	you 're being protected /.	end
1	and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /.	end
1	Well I 'll tell you what 's really frustrating from a journalist 's point of view as one who have lived in Beirut for nearly five years covered that war /.	Beirut ! country ; nearly five years ! date ;
1	When I worked in Lebanon you could go anywhere on that story /.	Lebanon ! country ;
1	You could cross lines /.	end
1	Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.	Terry Anderson ! person ;
1	Therefore by the end of the Lebanon story I thought the best journalists there knew more than the Lebanese /.	Lebanon ! country ; Lebanese ! national ;
1	I always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much /.	Lebanese ! national ;
1	What 's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird 's eye view /.	Iraq ! country ; Howie ! person ;
1	I care passionately about this story /.	end
1	I 'm so interested in it /.	end
1	but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom you want /.	end
1	And the brave reporters who are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.	every day ! date ;
1	And therefore it 's limited /.	end
1	and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.	end
1	There 's a lot of good things going on in Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	There 's a lot of progress being made we 're not seeing reported by the press /.	end
1	Do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?	end
1	No because I do n't have a bird 's eye view /.	end
1	I wish I could say /.	end
1	I wish I could be so sure /.	end
1	but General Casey does n't have a bird 's eye view /.	Casey ! person ;
1	And that 's why we get surprises in Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	Uh that 's why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out /.	eight million ! num ;
1	and maybe you know we 're going to see more surpises in the coming future there /.	end
1	But because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n't have that bird 's eye view /.	end
1	And as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story I find that really frustra- /-	end
1	I can not report it the way I 'd love to /.	end
1	So I 've been there five times /.	five ! num ;
1	but it 's episodic /.	end
1	It 's here /.	end
1	It 's there /.	end
1	It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.	end
1	pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake /.	recent months ! date ; Iraq ! country ; Katrina ! thing ; Rita ! thing ; Tom DeLay ! person ; Harriet Miers ! person ; Valerie Plame ! person ; Pakistan ! country ;
1	Um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /.	end
1	and these are all also important stories obviously /.	end
1	but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?	end
1	Yeah /.	end
1	No because to me this is the whole ballgame of the Bush administration /.	Bush ! person ;
1	Katrina and Rita they 'll come and go /.	Katrina ! thing ; Rita ! thing ;
1	but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.	Bush ! person ; Iraq ! country ;
1	If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /.	Bush ! person ;
1	Um if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.	end
1	so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the American people /.	American ! national ;
1	These are huge stakes involved /.	end
1	And so I do n't think it 's gotten the attention it 's deserved /.	end
1	And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.	Iraq ! country ; Iraqi ! national ;
1	The slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the US and British advisors out tomorrow the whole Iraqi navy would collapse /.	US ! country ; British ! national ; tomorrow ! date ; Iraqi ! national ;
1	That 's a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what the White House and the Defense Department say every day /.	the White House ! org ; the Defense Department ! org ; every day ! date ;
1	/.	end
1	Not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained Iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration /.	Iraqi ! national ;
1	So you 're saying there 's a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record /.	end
1	You quoted one US senior official and what the President of the United States and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense are saying to reporters every day /.	one US ! num ; the United States ! country ; Defense ! country ; every day ! org ;
1	Are we calling them on that /?	end
1	Right I do n't think enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically /.	Howie ! person ;
1	And a lot of numbers are thrown out /.	end
1	Eighty thousand this week we 've got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week /.	Eighty thousand this week ! num ; a hundred and twenty thousand next week ! date ;
1	Here 's what you learn when you go to Iraq /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	Where you have an Iraqi commander who 's a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /.	Iraqi ! national ;
1	And where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.	end
1	So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.	end
1	So I went down to see the navy there /.	end
1	The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander /.	Iraq ! country ;
1	so the people around him they 'll follow him into battle /.	end
1	But you take that one guy out there 's no Iraqi navy /.	one ! num ; Iraqi ! national ;
1	and it 's true of units all over the country /.	end
1	That 's really the key /.	end
1	You say that you are angry uh that Bush has fought the war as though it would be easy /.	Bush ! person ;
1	Are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so /?	end
1	Yes /.	end
1	Absolutely because I believe this is important /.	end
1	I believe that something very big is at stake /.	end
1	We 're dealing with a Muslim Arab civilization right now that 's that 's in decline , that 's heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and I believe dangerous for the stability of the world /.	Muslim Arab ! national ;
1	There 's something really important here at stake /.	end
1	and what makes me so angry at the Bush administration is not that they did n't frame the stakes /.	Bush ! person ;
1	It is important /.	end
1	But they never never appreciated how difficult it was /.	end
1	They never prepared the army or the American people for how difficult it was /.	American ! national ;
1	I mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in Pakistan a region you 're familiar with /.	Pakistan ! country ;
1	Um clearly it 's become a pretty big story /.	end
1	but for the first couple days I noticed it was n't that much of a television story /.	the first couple days ! date ;
1	and the reason was no pictures no video /.	end
1	No yes /.	end
1	Um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it 's in a remote part of the world /?	end
1	Uh Westerners are more interested in New Orleans than in Pakistan /?	Westerners ! national ; New Orleans ! country ; Pakistan ! country ;
1	I think all of the above /.	end
1	We 're so numbed also after Katrina and Rita /.	Katrina ! thing ; Rita ! thing ;
1	and now another earthquake /.	end
1	/.	end
1	It 's just become uh one natural disaster after another /.	one ! num ;
1	to hear ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand then it 's almost hard for a journalist to process /.	ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand ! num ;
1	Right /.	end
1	And it was remote /.	end
1	and people are exhausted I think both viewers and reporters /.	end
1	Ahead have New York Times columnists been asked not to write about Judy Miller /?	New York Times ! org ; Judy Miller ! person ;
1	More of my interview with Tom Friedman next /.	Tom Friedman ! person ;
1	Welcome back to Reliable Sources now a full hour each week here in our new time slot ten to eleven o'clock eastern /.	Reliable Sources ! art ; a full hour each week ! time ; ten to eleven o'clock eastern ! date ;
1	More now of my conversation with New York Times columnist Tom Friedman about his book the new online charge to read him and Judy Miller /.	New York Times ! org ; Tom Friedman ! person ; Judy Miller ! person ;
1	Now your new book The World is Flat I 've got it here /.	The World is Flat ! art ;
1	uh monster best seller more than a million copies better than any book you 've ever written before /.	more than a million ! num ;
1	Um you were recently profiled about this in Fortune magazine /.	Fortune ! org ;
1	and uh let 's just say that it did n't say you walked on water but it came close /.	end
1	Uh but one of the criticisms /-	end
1	What 's wrong with that /?	end
1	It says that you 're the composer of the nation 's talking points which was news to me /.	end
1	Uh one of the things it said was that uh in your book and in your writing that CEOs play a very central role /.	end
1	And the suggestion was well CEOs love you , you 're asked to speak at all these corporate events , maybe because you give them a very large uh share of the narrative /.	end
1	Yeah /.	end
1	Mhm /.	end
1	Mhm /.	end
1	That a reasonable observation /?	end
1	Yeah it is a reasonable observation /.	end
1	And my reaction to that is look if I want to understand the underlying technology that is flattening the world who do I go to /?	end
1	do I go to I do n't know Central America /?	Central America ! location ;
1	Do I go to um uh the factory floor /?	end
1	Or do I go to the innovators and entrepeneurs who actually put all this together /?	end
1	So I make no apology for that at all /.	end
1	Um fact I would make a criticism of it /.	end
1	There are n't enough people during the last few years who actually went out and talked to the innovators who are doing all of these things who are actually reshaping the world /.	the last few years ! date ;
1	Just the opposite /.	end
1	We kind of had an Enron effect /.	Enron ! org ;
1	and Enron effect was all CEOs are guilty unless proven innocent , therefore who wants to talk to them /?	Enron ! org ;
1	And therefore I would argue -- /.	end
1	Wait a second /.	a second ! time ;
1	wait a second /.	a second ! time ;
1	Journalists uh subscribe to stereotypes because there are a few crooks at major corporations because you know they 're all bad guys /?	end
1	Yeah yeah /.	end
1	Yeah I would say /.	end
1	uh that 's a harsh uh assessment /.	end
1	I would say that there 's several things happened basically in the last three years /.	the last three years ! date ;
1	I would call it a perfect storm /.	end
1	One was nine eleven /.	One ! num ; nine eleven ! thing ;
1	That distracted us okay /.	end
1	The other was the Enron effect /.	Enron ! org ;
1	You know no one wanted to be sort of seen with CEOs /.	end
1	And number three was the dot com bust which made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /.	number three ! num ;
1	And as a result I would argue that really masked what is actually a fundemental inflection point the flattening of the world that we 're going from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /.	end
1	The argument of this book is that that shift is actually going to have as big an effect over time as Gutenberg and the printing press /.	Gutenberg ! person ;
1	And I would argue a little bit that it got missed because of all these other distractions /.	end
1	But it 's only had an effect on Tom Friedman 's career /.	Tom Friedman 's ! person ;
1	In fact you were the Playboy interview /.	Playboy ! org ;
1	Hey put that paper down /.	end
1	/.	end
1	I bought it for the articles /.	end
1	Uh I enjoyed the interview /.	end
1	and you said in there that your wife uh edits all your columns and she says do n't publish it /.	end
1	Yes she does /.	end
1	You go back and rewrite it /.	end
1	I 'm afraid I do /.	end

1	My wife Andrea edits them all /.	Andrea ! person ;

1	Now your international readership on the New York Times website has gone down because of this new experiment the Times has where it costs forty nine ninety - five a year for non-subscribers at home to read Times columnists /.

1	That 's got to be disappointing for you /.	end
1	You know um I 'm torn /.	end
1	Uh and I 've said this to my bosses /.	end
1	Um I want my paper to thrive /.	end
1	and if we have a situation where young people grow up in the world that thinks that newspapers are things you read for free online who 's going to pay my travel expenses /?	end
1	And at the same time one of the greatest things about New York Times online is I got to reach an audience that just was exponential to what you got in the dead tree edition of the New York Times /.	one ! num ; New York Times ! org ; the New York Times ! org ;
1	And because I write about international affairs so I got a lot of young people in India and Egypt and whatnot /.	India ! country ; Egypt ! country ;
1	and for them fifty dollars that may be their tuition for half a year /.	fifty dollars ! money ; half a year ! date ;
1	So I 'm honestly torn /.	end
1	I really hope this works because I want the New York Times to have a platform that is sustainable /.	the New York Times ! org ;
1	But at the same time I hope we can eventually find a way to re-engage those people because definitely we 've lost some of them /.	end
1	Eh in the Valerie Plame leak investigation there 's an allegation bouncing around the blogosphere that I just thought I would address with you which is have New York Times columnists somehow been told not to write about this because of Judy Miller 's involvement and being in jail , now being out of jail /.	Valerie Plame ! person ; New York Times ! org ; Judy Miller 's ! person ;

1	Did you even tell the boss /?	end

1	I 'm focused on other things /.	end
1	There 's a lot we do n't know obviously about the Judith Miller situation /.	Judith Miller ! person ;
1	but why do you think that she has gotten so much criticism /?	end
1	After all whether you agree with her or not this is a woman who believed in her convictions and went off to jail for eighty - five days /.	eighty - five days ! date ;
1	Um you know um Judy 's always been a pioneer and an agent of change you know um and uh has been at the forefront of a lot of stories /.	Judy ! person ;

1	Eliminate the personal income tax -LRB- Reproduced from Yueguang blog -RRB- .	Yueguang blog ! art ;
1	Dift Wu	Dift Wu ! person ;
1	Official data confirm that in 2004 the total personal income tax for the country amounted to approximately 181 billion , of which 65 % came from the working class , and only 10 % came from the wealthy .	2004 ! date ; approximately 181 billion ! num ; 65 % ! per ; 10 % ! per ;
1	Clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners .	end
1	While this type of tax in China has no effect on regulating the income gap or on " taking from the rich to help the poor , " neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class .	China ! country ;
1	If this tax continues to be collected , it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax .	end
1	Clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged .	end
1	I propose eliminating the personal income tax just as the agricultural tax was eliminated , to give people an opportunity to prosper .	end
1	If we think in terms of humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by letting poor people get rich , we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for China 's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person .	China ! country ; 800 yuan ! money ; 6400 yuan ! money ;
1	That would take it to a minimally humanized level , and then we could really talk about " people first . "	first ! order ;
1	With a threshold below this level , the poor will always be poor .	end
1	Yesterday CCTV presented a program on adjustment of the personal income tax , emphasized that the main goal of the adjustment was to " take from the rich " and let poor people get wealthy .	CCTV ! org ;
1	If we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy , the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled .	end
1	With anything under this threshold , the poor will have no chance to get rich .	end
1	And if we 're looking at it in terms of " taking from the rich , " the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing China 's social national income , namely how to eliminate the " unreported income . "	China ! country ;
1	The income of the vast majority of China 's rich people is unreported income , and unreported income is a problem that Chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of China , an uncontrollable black hole in China 's social oversight .	China ! country ; Chinese ! national ; China ! country ; China ! country ;
1	This is far from being a tax problem ; it is a deeper systemic problem .	end
1	If China 's personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich , neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy , so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do ?	China ! country ;
1	It would be better to eliminate it in one fell swoop , as we did with the agricultural tax .	one ! num ;
1	Below are some of the main reasons :	end
1	1. China 's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat .	1. China ! num ;
1	In China the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state 's financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap .	China ! country ;
1	In 2004 China 's income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion , accounting for about 6 % of the state 's financial revenues .	2004 China ! date ; approximately 180 billion ! country ; about 6 % ! num ;
1	But of this 180 billion , about 65 % , or 117 billion , was paid by the working class .	180 billion ! num ; about 65 % ! per ; 117 billion ! num ;
1	Less than 10 % was paid by the wealthy .	Less than 10 % ! per ;
1	In China more than 90 % of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor .	China more than 90 % ! country ;
1	These poor people , who struggle just to pay for the necessities of life , their children 's education , old age , illness and death , also have to pay income tax .	end
1	In all of China 's cities now , anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor .	China ! country ; 2000 yuan or less ! money ;
1	If a husband and wife have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan , and if they pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan , they have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan .	2000 yuan ! money ; 33 % ! per ; over 1500 yuan ! money ; 1670 yuan ! money ;
1	A household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses , and their standard of living will decline .	end
1	And should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital , the family may well find itself in an economic crisis .	end
1	And if a family like this wants to buy its own home , that will basically be impossible .	end
1	And if only one person in a three - person family is employed , the family will have a very difficult life .	one ! num ; three ! num ;
1	But even so , they have to pay 165 yuan in income tax .	165 yuan ! money ;
1	Clearly , if our income tax threshold is set at 1500 yuan , our society is destined always to produce a proletariat , always to deny hope to the poor or to the masses of ever getting rich .	1500 yuan ! money ;
1	Our production relations are no different from the production relations in Marx 's " Das Kapital , " constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living .	Marx ! person ; Das Kapital ! art ;
1	In short , if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan , it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich .	6400 yuan ! money ;
1	Conversely , if the threshold is too low , it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich .	end
1	2. The personal income tax is absolutely unable to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich .	2. ! num ;
1	We should not entertain any illusions that China 's income tax can in any way regulate income distribution , much less that it can " take from the rich and give to the poor . "	China ! country ;
1	In Chinese society , 20 % of the people hold 80 % of social wealth , and 80 % of the people are able to use only 20 % of the social wealth to suffer through their lives .	Chinese ! national ; 20 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ; 20 % ! per ;
1	In China , freedom , human rights , democracy , happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20 % of the people .	China ! country ; 20 % ! per ;
1	Western countries that attack China for not having human rights , democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; these 20 % of upper - class citizens have broader human rights , democracy and freedom than do Western societies .	China ! country ; these 20 % ! per ;
1	When God looks at China , he sees only these 20 % ; the other 80 % he ca n't see clearly .	China ! country ; these 20 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ;
1	The income of the vast majority of these 20 , of upper - class citizens in China is basically unreported income ; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth .	20 ! num ; China ! country ;
1	Only if China eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people .	China ! country ;
1	And if China wants to eliminate unreported income , to date there is no sign of that , and there is no compelling evidence to explain when China might eliminate unreported income .	China ! country ; China ! country ;
1	Anyhow , it is not something our generation will see .	end
1	That is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of China 's rich people .	China ! country ;
1	It does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability of poor people to get rich .	end
1	A very simple explanation is that poor people are all wage earners who rely on fully declared wages for their living ; they do not have unreported income .	end
1	Fully 100 % of their income falls within the income - tax field of vision , so they ca n't escape even if they wanted to .	100 % ! per ;
1	Add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required to meet the necessary expenditures to maintain the basic necessities of life , and the poor are completely stymied .	end
1	" Dragons give birth to dragons , phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave . "	end
1	" The children of poor people are always poor . "	end
1	With the previous 800 yuan income tax threshold , if it were strictly enforced , 80 % of beggars would have to pay .	800 yuan ! money ; 80 % ! per ;
1	With a threshold set below 5000 yuan , this generation of poor people need not think about buying a home or driving a car .	5000 yuan ! money ;
1	They will always be poor .	end
1	Of course , many children of poor people are able to get rich , but this came about because the parents struggled harder , tightening their belts and " skimping on food and clothing " for themselves .	end
1	Now how many university students who have received acceptance notifications are unable to enroll , and how many enrolled university students from the countryside have parents who are living through unimaginably hard times ?	end
1	In Western countries , the personal income tax is the most effective means of controlling excessively high incomes among the rich .	end
1	But these are countries ruled by law , where official income is all recorded , citizen 's incomes are fully transparent , and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of regulating income distribution .	end
1	The situation in China is not like that ; if the personal income tax has an effect , it 's to increase financial revenues , and it has absolutely no income - regulating effect .	China ! country ;
1	3. Eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants .	3. ! num ;
1	The vast majority of China 's 900 million peasants are unable to reach the income level for paying income tax .	900 million ! num ;
1	But the peasants have contractual land , they have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions , and they have basic housing .	end
1	But if people in the cities do n't have money , everything is a struggle .	end
1	If they go shopping for food by bike , they have to pay 20 cents for parking .	20 cents ! money ;
1	They ca n't not pay the rent or they 'll have to sleep on the street .	end
1	In terms of macroeconomic law , the distribution of wealth in Chinese society is set at 2/8 , with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth , and the 80 % of poor people holding just 20 % of the social wealth .	Chinese ! national ; 2/8 ! num ; the 20 % ! per ; 80 % ! per ; the 80 % ! per ; 20 % ! per ;
1	The personal income tax threshold is too low , the urban population is too large , and the population participating in the 20 % that goes to peasants is even greater , so the peasants ultimately have to get a reduced share of this 20 % .	the 20 % ! per ; this 20 % ! per ;
1	If we eliminate the personal income tax , the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced , and the people participating in the peasant struggle for this 20 % will be reduced , which will benefit the peasants .	this 20 % ! per ;
1	In China the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person .	China ! country ; 80 % ! per ;
1	4. This will really be beneficial in establishing a soft - landing market economy system .	4. ! num ;
1	In recent years China 's rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth ; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon , and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained , healthy growth of the national economy .	recent years China ! date ;
1	The blood has all been pumped out of the national economy ; it 's like eating up all the seeds sown in the spring .	end
1	The proportion of financial revenues from the personal income tax is about 6 % .	about 6 % ! per ;
1	If we cancel out this 6 % , we can slow down financial growth .	this 6 % ! per ;
1	And in the Chinese economic cycle , excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system .	Chinese ! national ;
1	Compared to market investment , the efficiency of financial investment is less than half .	less than half ! num ;
1	And when there is too much financial investment , corruption is everywhere , all the time .	end
1	5. It promotes the establishment of a harmonious society .	5. ! num ;
1	Chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor , middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle , with 40 % or more of the society being middle class .	Chinese ! national ; 40 % or more ! per ;
1	Chinese society is 80 % poor people , 20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class , or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable .	Chinese ! national ; 80 % ! per ; 20 % ! per ;
1	There is no way this " 2/8 " social structure can establish a harmonious society .	2/8 ! num ;
1	Eliminating the personal income tax to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society .	end
1	In short , if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich , and is unable to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich , then it is better not to have this kind of personal income tax .	end
1	We need to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter , so as to benefit the country and the people .	end

1	-- Some Thoughts on the Attitude of Benign Inheritance towards Social Reform .	end
1	A glance at the title , people with a little political sensitivity may roughly understand the core topic of this article : the rule of benign interaction between planned economy and market economy , and between public ownership and private ownership -- because only their relationships are those between a father and a son , and it is only between them are there different conflicts involving " human relations , " " rules " and " science , " as well as bloody wrestling between classes , factions and individuals on the basis of morality and interests .	end
1	Comparing planned economy and public ownership to a father is tantamount to comparing market economy and private ownership to a son , which holds water principally and historically no matter you put it this way or another .	end
1	This is because the former two given " fatherhood " are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China , while the latter two dubbed " son " in this article -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of China 's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership , which grew into today 's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up .	two ! num ; socialist ! national ; China ! country ; China ! country ; Mao Zedong ! person ; today ! date ; 30 years ! date ;
1	Regarding this , the factual development process of political civilization that the Marxist ideology has been increasingly marginalized over the past 30 years or so is a strong evidence .	Marxist ! national ; the past 30 years ! date ;
1	By sorting out the essence of the above historical background and conceptual relationships , we will have a pretty thorough , comprehensive and systematic knowledge framework about the benign inevitable trends and development guidelines of the future society dependent on the rule of society , so that the associated impression captured may be more concrete .	end
1	Regarding this , my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy , public ownership and the people 's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really " fresh " systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to , no matter how scientific its kernel is , it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems .	China ! country ; the mid and late 20th century ! date ;
1	However , this should not provide an excuse to overthrow it by fair means or foul , as he is our father and the common choice of millions of laboring people .	millions ! num ;
1	The fact that it " finally became our national character and main system after over half a century of international and domestic political transformation " is a stronger proof that it is the milestone for a new civilization resulted from the blood and sweat of thousands of proletarian revolutionary martyrs .	half a century ! date ; thousands ! num ;
1	Therefore , no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government , we should respect and develop her on the basis of inheritance , innovation and improvement .	end
1	Is my opinion above correct ?	end
1	I believe you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat the above - mentioned " father " system and " son " system with impartiality and sufficient goodwill .	end
1	For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : the " father " system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country , the nation , and the overall society -- while the " son " system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery .	end
1	So , we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences , because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal .	end
1	It is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development , distorts normal " human relations " and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous .	end
1	Yes , this is the case .	end
1	My opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all , because this is true not only in theory , but also to the rule of social development as demonstrated by historical facts , as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of the country : None of the current " advocates of market economy , private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie " has established and proposed a new deal " against planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat . "	end
1	All their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as " lower efficiency due to centralized management " or " inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal , " all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 % " vested interests , " and their development logic asks the " 95 % " laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure the hard work -- it speaks for itself how empty , ridiculous , sick , ignorant and anti-government it is .	less than 5 % ! per ; " 95 % " ! per ;
1	That 's why I want to say to the world and the age by the end of the article : when the father 's toes are injured , we should try our best to treat the foot problem , and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of respecting human relations , obeying people 's wishes , conforming to science and carrying on the legacy -- if the present capitalist followers frantically urge the son to kill him by all means , the result could only be a tragedy !	end
1	And these happen to be the core of the destiny where the capitalist roaders " will inevitably bury themselves due to their ignorance and insanity , and more or less harm the human society ! "	end
1	At last , I would like to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who blindly oppose , hate and even suppress planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat , especially the " mainstream elite scholars " including Wu Jinglian , who insist on smearing the " father " to the end : do not treat the " fathers " on which the new civilization is based barbarously , against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains .	Wu Jinglian ! person ;
1	The result is definitely a tragedy -- because even if you kill the " father , " your felony will be disdained by the age and condemned by the people , which naturally leads to nothing good !	end

1	Note , this gas price includes all taxes .	end
1	The current gas price in Beijing is 5.09 yuan / liter , 2 mao and 9 fen more than in the US .	Beijing ! country ; 5.09 yuan ! money ; 2 mao and 9 fen ! money ; US ! country ;
1	In fact , the gas price difference between the two places is larger than 2 mao and 9 fen because China 's gas price does not include so many taxes as in the US ; for example , the highway maintenance fee in China is paid separately .	two ! num ; 2 mao and 9 fen ! money ; China ! country ; US ! country ; China ! country ;
1	Just now , I only narrated a fact .	end
1	But I believe that different persons see different problems in this fact .	end
1	Let me describe people 's two reactions that I can imagine , or the two problems I can see .	two ! num ; two ! num ;
1	1. The US gas price is too cheap .	1. ! num ; US ! country ;
1	In an absolute sense , the US gas price has +already been cheaper than China 's , and in a relative sense , the US gas price is even cheaper .	US ! country ; China ! country ; US ! country ;
1	In the US , the money you pay for a meal at McDonald 's can fill up more than 10 liters of gas , but in Beijing you can get 5 - 6 liters of gas at most .	US ! country ; McDonald ! org ; 10 liters ! measure ; Beijing ! country ; 5 - 6 liters ! measure ;
1	The US low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country 's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources .	US ! country ;
1	However , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the US excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc.	US ! country ;
1	It is totally a joke that the US gas price could be cheaper than China 's .	US ! country ; China ! country ;
1	2. China 's gas price is too expensive .	2. China ! num ;
1	Both Americans and Chinese buy gas from the international market , and the technology and cost of oil refinement are not too much different .	Americans ! national ; Chinese ! national ;
1	But with the US gas price including taxes even lower than China 's gas price excluding taxes , you can see how much money Chinese oil companies have made out of this .	US ! country ; China ! country ; Chinese ! national ;
1	If there are no price controls and monopolies , China 's gas price should n't have been this high .	China ! country ;
1	I want to say that I think these two opinions are both correct .	two ! num ;
1	So , on the issue of oil consumption , I think China and the US , the No. 1 and No. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair .	China ! country ; US ! country ; 1 ! num ; 2 ! num ;
1	From a global perspective , the US gas price is obviously too low .	US ! national ;
1	So Mankiw at Harvard even formed a " Pigou Club , " gathering social celebrities who support levying higher taxes on gas prices -LRB- hereby raising gas prices -RRB- .	Mankiw ! person ; Harvard ! org ;
1	China 's gas prices are more complicated .	China ! country ;
1	In fact , gas prices in China are probably not very high , but in order to reduce China 's future overdependence on gas , it may be better that China 's gas prices are higher .	China ! country ; China ! country ; China ! country ;
1	But , the direct result of the gas price increase in China will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies .	China ! country ;
1	This part of money will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better .	end
1	In other words , the gas price in China is too high in the distributive sense .	China ! country ;
1	It is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people .	end
1	But in terms of sustainability , China 's gas price may still be too low .	China ! country ;
1	We need high gas prices to control the overdependence on energy imports .	end
1	Perhaps someone will condemn me , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people .	end
1	If you are a taxi driver , my reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of our taxi licensing regulation system .	end
1	If you are a car owner , my reply is : ride the subway and bus more often .	end
1	It saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say " life is unbearable . "	end
1	Compared with most people , your life is already quite good .	end

1	At 1:00pm , the neighbor called me , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm .	1:00pm ! time ; 3:00pm ! time ;
1	I of course agreed and asked them not to rush .	end
1	This wait lasted till 5:30pm , when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures .	5:30pm ! time ; half ! num ;
1	I comforted him first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital .	first ! order ;
1	My neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my neighbor 's fault .	end
1	He clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn .	end
1	My car was completely damaged and had been towed away .	end
1	I forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -LRB- mine was liability - only coverage -RRB- and asked the friend to send their family home .	end
1	And then the nightmare began .	end
1	The next day , my neighbor called me , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from	The next day ! date ;
1	I told him part would be covered by my car insurance .	end
1	After a while , he called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford	end
1	I tried my best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly	end
1	Just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this .	several dozen thousand bucks ! money ;
1	She also said my car was a Japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident .	Japanese ! national ;
1	She added that I should pay the money because the car was mine .	end
1	I hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on .	end
1	My wife -LSB- pw% -RSB- had been persuading me aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury .	end
1	She asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first .	first ! order ;
1	So I did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry .	end
1	Out of my expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea .	third ! order ;
1	The telephone rang just as I was about to go to work in the morning .	end
1	I thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily .	end
1	Unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man .	end
1	He said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me if I compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -LRB- three times -RRB- , otherwise they would see me in court .	three ! num ;
1	He added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court .	ten years ! date ;
1	As a great Chinese guy , how could I be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ?	Chinese ! national ;
1	I also took up the weapon of law for justice .	end
1	Of course , I also retained a lawyer .	end
1	Out of my expectation , my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls .	two ! num ;
1	One was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident .	One ! num ;
1	There was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them .	end
1	Someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station .	end
1	The police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch .	end
1	The second call was to their lawyer .	second ! order ;
1	So their lawyer dropped the lawsuit .	end
1	Of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening .	end
1	The most classic one was : Do n't ever dream of living a life back to China , as we have people across the country .	China ! country ;
1	Disgusting !	end
1	Here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks .	end
1	I think many people will say they wo n't .	end
1	I would suggest not to lend online .	end
1	However , the Internet is after all virtual .	end
1	Words sometimes have no emotions .	end
1	When your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a " no ? "	end
1	Anyhow , I was not able to do that .	end
1	I lent my car to some people in need after that , and I believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple .	end
1	In conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : .	two ! num ;
1	Our side : A 02 Camary of 50,000 miles , retaining fee 200 . Annual leave two days .	02 Camary ! date ; 50,000 miles ! product ; 200 ! measure ; two ! num ;
1	Their side : One leg of the father -LRB- repaired -RRB- , hospital charge : unknown , costs for missing work hours : unknown , retaining fee : unknown .	One ! num ;
1	And most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -LRB- except children -RRB- .	end

1	Saddam 's last days and what is said he was like	Saddam ! person ; last ! order ;
1	Bu Thari	Bu Thari ! person ;
1	What we know about Saddam Hussein in recent years is that he had changed a lot .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; recent years ! date ;
1	He had Islamic tendecies and acts which many Iraqis mentioned , saying that Saddam supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing Koran , and charities , and the dancer 's punishment was death .	Islamic ! national ; Iraqis ! national ; Saddam ! person ; Koran ! art ;
1	He had many works .	end
1	But some explained his Islamic tendency by saying that he was currying favor with the Sunnis as if they were reading his mind .	Islamic ! person ; Sunnis ! national ;
1	I have followed Saddam Hussein , especially in recent years , and I noticed about him was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; recent years ! date ;
1	And his punishment was unjust .	end
1	I mean , for example , the dancer would be killed after second offence .	second ! order ;
1	I did not expect anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it , but like the most idiots his aim was correct but the method was wrong .	end
1	Another example - after his son Udai harmed the Iraqi people and attacked women and other matters , Saddam ordered him to be killed .	Udai ! person ; Iraqi ! national ; Saddam ! person ;
1	And in fact he was fired on but survived miraculously , after being hit with several fatal shots some of which hit his spine .	end
1	This is a sign that there was good in him otherwise he would not have ordered the killing of his son , his own child .	end
1	But he was not a scholar nor feared in God .	end
1	I myself heard from some people who were in Iraq about the things that Saddam Hussein used to do , and could not be reasonably done by anyone other than a good Moslem To the extent that many said of his actions that they were only to gain favor amongst the Sunnis and the religious .	Iraq ! country ; Saddam Hussein ! person ; Moslem ! national ; Sunnis ! national ;
1	But we judge by the appearances and his end was in line with the appearance .	end
1	In his last days during the fall of Baghdad and his disappearance , an old woman or man said on TV on al - Jazeera channel that he was hiding in her house and had had his prayer mat with him and was always praying and reading the Koran .	last ! order ; Baghdad ! country ; al - Jazeera ! org ; Koran ! art ;
1	Do we say no , this is hypocrisy ?	end
1	Bear in mind that many have said that Saddam prayed regularly especially after he was put in prison by the Rafida and their masters .	Saddam ! person ; Rafida ! person ;
1	Some of those who said that he was always praying and reading the Koran are the Christians who visited him in his prison cell .	Koran ! art ; Christians ! national ;
1	Finally , during his hanging , the Rafida tried to distract him and keep him from saying the Creed before his death .	Rafida ! person ;
1	They were trying everything they could but we say that God made him steadfast for the whole world to see that he died acknowledging God .	end
1	The Rafida were shouting provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr so that he would lose control and curse them , then they would have killed him .	Rafida ! person ; Muqtada ! person ; al - Sadr ! person ;
1	So they could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from Saddam and cut the rest .	Saddam ! person ;
1	However he remained steadfast in saying the creed and was killed whilst saying it .	end
1	I believe that this could n't have happened without God making him steadfast otherwise God would not have made him steadfast in it .	end
1	As one of the sheikhs says , many people when they were supposed to say the creed and were being dictated the creed by those present would murmur " Did love see drunkards ? "	one ! num ;
1	Other people say , I have not said it while I was alive and you want me to say it when I am dying ... the truth is what is apparent .	end
1	But Saddam Hussein was reasonable in that he repented and turned to his creator who receives the repentance from his slave .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;
1	And he committed himself to the worship of God . And remained loyal to God .	end
1	I ask God to have mercy on him and to forgive him and to give him an ample dwelling in his paradise and guide the rest of the Ba'thists .	Ba'thists ! national ;

1	Saddam Hussein -LRB- mockingly -RRB- : I thought you had come to apologize and restore power to the Iraqis .	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Iraqis ! national ;
1	Rumsfeld : We have nothing to apologize for , you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades .	Rumsfeld ! person ; Iraq ! country ; more ! num ;
1	Saddam Hussein : I know that you are ignorant of history , and I know that your president is no less ignorant but it seems that you have continued to lie to the extent that you now believe yourselves .	Saddam Hussein ! person ;

1	Saddam Hussein -LRB- interrupting -RRB- : Before you offer me your rotten goods , I ask you did you find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not ?	Saddam Hussein ! person ; Iraq ! country ;

1	Do you deny that you had intentions to manufacture a nuclear bomb ?	end
1	Saddam Hussein : We have had no weapons of mass destruction since 1991 , we were truthful when we spoke with the international inspection mission , we were truthful in our letters to Kofi Annan , you knew these facts but you were looking for any pretext to occupy Iraq and topple its legitimate authority .

1	P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .	P&G ! org ;

1	If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?	Mason ! person ; New Yorkers ! national ;
1	It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .	Mason ! person ;
1	In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .	Mason ! person ;
1	For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur .	New York ! country ; NAACP ! org ; Mason ! person ;
1	People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''	end
1	These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double - edged , aiming inward as well as outward .	Polish ! national ;
1	The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .	Jews ! national ;
1	In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .	Lenny Bruce ! person ;
1	But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .	Jackie Mason ! person ;
1	Why constructive ?	end
1	Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .	one ! num ;
1	That 's why it 's dangerous to have well - intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .	end
1	As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ''	Elizabeth Kristol ! person ; the New York Times ! org ; Mason ! person ;

1	Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .	end

1	And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real - life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .	1972 CBS ! date ; Bridget Loves Bernie ! org ; Meredith Baxter ! art ; David Birney ! person ;
1	Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .	Chicken Soup ! art ;
1	So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .	end
1	Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues .	the didactic days ! date ; Norman Lear ! person ;
1	To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .	end
1	For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well - paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .	Michael ! person ; Jackie ! person ; Jewish ! national ;
1	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .	Mason ! person ;
1	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .	Mason ! person ; Jewish ! national ;
1	But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .	Mason ! person ;
1	I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic - Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz .	Catholic ! national ; Carmelite ! national ; Auschwitz ! fact ;
1	That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .	New York City ! country ;
