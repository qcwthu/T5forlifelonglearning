If your leather is not responding to conventional methods, vinegar and olive oil can be used instead. Mix one part vinegar and one part extra virgin olive oil. Then, dab onto the leather with a soft cleaning cloth, using circular motions to apply. Let sit for 10 minutes before buffing the chair with a dry cloth until it shines., Baby wipes can be used to remove any gunk or built up residue stuck on a leather couch. If you're hesitant to use baby wipes on furniture, they make wipes specifically designed for removing gunk from leather as well. You can buy these wipes online or at a local furniture store., If you have young children, you may end up with marker stains on your leather chair. These can be removed with hairspray.   Use aerosol hairspray. Spray it over the stained areas. Then, rub it off gently and see if the stain comes out.Eucalyptus oil can also be used to remove marker stains if hairspray does not work.	Try vinegar and olive oil. Use baby wipes. Try hairspray.
Remove debris like leaves and algae from the bottom of the pool once the water is drained. Then place your water hose at the deep-end side of the pool. Position it near the ledge so that the water will run over the tile when you turn it on., Because the acid solution emits noxious fumes and is harmful if it gets onto your skin and body, rubber boots, safety gloves and goggles, and a respirator with an acid approved filter are necessary. For extra precaution, wear a protective suit that is chemical-resistant., You can use a plastic bucket. Make sure to slowly add the acid to the water and not the other way around. Because the acid will fizz and emit fumes when you pour it into the water, make sure you are wearing your respirator, goggles, gloves, and protective clothing.You can purchase muriatic acid and acid-resistant cleaning tools from your local pool maintenance store or online.  Starting at the deep end of the pool, work the solution into the grout with the brush. Working on small sections at a time, scrub the tile with an acid-resistant scrub brush. Once the calcium silicate scaling is removed, rinse the tile with water using the hose.Alternatively, fill a watering can with the solution and use the can to pour it onto the tiles. Then use the acid-resistant scrub brush to clean the tile. Repeat this process until all the tiles are cleaned.  Add 2 pounds (.9 kilograms) of soda ash for every gallon of acid. Do this once you are done cleaning all of the tiles. The soda ash neutralizes the acid so it can be safely removed from your pool., Do this using a water pump. Once the acid is pumped out, rinse the pool with the hose. Then proceed to pump this water out of the pool as well. When the pool is completely rinsed and cleaned, refill it with water.When rinsing the pool, make sure to rinse your boots, gloves, goggles, and protective clothing with water as well. Rinse until all the acid is completely gone. Discard any unused acid at your local hazardous waste disposal.	Drain your pool. Wear protective clothing. Add 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of muriatic acid to 1 gallon of water in a bucket. Apply the solution to the tile with an acid brush. Add soda ash to the acidic solution at the bottom of the pool. Pump the neutralized acid out of the pool.
If you've got rodents, you'll see the insulation hanging down (they like to nest in it) and droppings on the vapor barrier. If it is bad, get rid of both. Once the area is clean, you can see what needs to be done. Rodents can carry some nasty diseases (Hantavirus for one, but it is rare) so you may want to wear high-quality respiratory protection.; , Thoroughly examine for any opening 1/4" or larger. Close off any crawl space doors with an actual door instead of a casual closure such as a piece of wood pulled over an opening. You can stuff small openings with steel wool. Medium openings can be bridged with 1/4" hardware cloth (mesh) stapled over the opening. Make sure to check where plumbing, electric and heating enter and exit your house.  Fill or bridge gaps where the house meets the ground to prevent entry. You should safely get up on the roof prepared to fill holes where vents exit the roof and where two roof lines intersect. Bring along hardware cloth and fillers as used in the crawl space. This is important because arboreal rats have no problem jumping on to the house, moving in, and finding their way to your generous supplies of food, water, heat, and shelter.  Put some traps up, check for openings to fill, and remember to reset your traps frequently until you have no activity. , This should do it. Put down plenty, first, baited, but without setting them. This is called prebaiting, and they get the idea that the bait on the little wooden platform is safe. Peanut butter makes a good bait. After prebaiting, set the traps. Make sure to check them.  After they're all gone, seal up the holes.  Rats think your clutter is a lovely, undisturbed place to live. Garage doors are hard to exclude because of small openings around the outside of the door, and the fact that you need to open the door. Call the goodwill, St. Vincent's or 1800 Got Junk to clear out the stuff.  Watch for freezing pipes if you pull insulation in the wintertime.  A garage door weather seal is used to seal the gap between the perimeter of a garage door and the door frame. The material used is made of a flexible rubber,which is vulnerable to chewing by mice and other rodents. Rodents chew through the lower corners to gain access to their new home. A flexible metal strip can be secured to the garage door weather seal where the seal meets the ground. The garage/ home will then be better protected against pesky rodents sneaking inside.	Clean the crawl space. Look around the inside and outside of your crawl space. Check the outside of the house very thoroughly. Check the attic to see if you have any activity up there. Trim back any trees with branches near the roof to slow down roof jumping.  , If you only had a minor infestation, set a few traps. If you have a bad infestation and they are in the walls, leave a few exit points so they can get out and don't die inside the house. Clean the garage, and the back bedroom. When you're done and you think you have fixed your rodent problem, replace the failed insulation and vapor barrier in the crawl space. Look for problems with your garage door.
Choose from these options:   Apple cider vinegar and water. This natural solution works well to break down the adhesive, but it can leave a smell on the wall; only use it if your wallpaper is covering paint, not a bottom layer of wallpaper. Liquid fabric softener and water. This solution is cheap and effective, but you may not want to use chemicals on your wall. Manufactured wallpaper stripper. You can buy wallpaper stripper solution from the hardware store to use on your walls. Warm water. When all else fails, plain water usually does the trick.  This is especially important if the border is made of vinyl. If you don't score it, the liquid solution won't be able to seep in. Scrape the scoring tool over the border for several minutes, until it's covered with hundreds of tiny holes.   Make sure the perforating tool you use is made of plastic, not metal. A metal scraping tool could harm the wall underneath. If you don't have a perforating tool, use a plastic knife to make criss-crossing scores across the border.  Spray it all over, in the corners, near the edges, and in the middle. Don't skimp with the solution; the wallpaper needs to be completely wet for the adhesive to begin to loosen. Let the solution sit for 15 minutes before continuing.  Use a plastic scraping tool (similar to an ice scraper) to life the edge of the wallpaper and begin scraping it away. Use one hand to scrape and the other one to peel. Keep scraping and peeling across the length of the border.   If you run into a stubborn area, douse it with solution. Let it sit for five minutes before continuing. Don't rip the wallpaper off in strips; this makes it a lot more difficult to remove the tiny pieces.  You may have to saturate the stray pieces with more solution. Use the scraper to loosen them, then peel them away.	Fill a spray bottle with a wallpaper stripper solution.There are a variety of different substances you can use to spray on the wallpaper to loosen the adhesive. Use a perforating tool to score the border. Saturate the wallpaper border with the solution. Start scraping. Lift away the wallpaper and scrape the pieces underneath.
Shuffle a standard 52-card deck. Deal 20 cards to yourself and 20 to the other player.          Keep all cards face-down for the time being. Use a hard, sturdy surface like a table or wood floor for ideal game play.  Deal the remaining cards into 4 piles in one row at the center of the table between you and your opponent. Place cards, left to right, as follows:          Deal 5 cards to the far left pile. This is one of the reserve piles for game play. Deal 1 card to the middle-left pile. This is one of the active piles during game play. Deal 1 card to the middle-right pile. This is one of the active piles during game play. Deal 5 cards to the far right pile. This is one of the reserve piles for game play., Have each player deal 5 cards off of their pile of 20 cards. The new pile of 5 cards becomes the hand that is played from; the remaining 15 become a draw pile for that player.          Keep the 5 cards of your playing hand face-down until game play begins. For the rest of the game, you should always have 5 cards—and only 5 cards—in your playing hand by drawing from your draw pile., Have your opponent flip over one of the two middle piles of 1 card in the center of the table, while you flip over the other one.          Count down from 3 at the same time as your opponent so that you flip over the cards at the same time.  Survey your 5 cards to determine if any can be played on either of the active middle cards that you just flipped over. Play a card if it is in sequential order from one of the middle cards, in either ascending or descending order, regardless of suit.         For example, if one of the middle cards is a 5, you can play a 4 or a 6 from your hand on top of it. The order of cards is 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A. The order continues in a circuit, so if there is an Ace on a middle pile, you can play a King or a 2 from your hand on top of the pile. Don’t let your opponent see the cards in your hand.  Keep laying down cards from your hand in ascending or descending order from the top cards on either of the middle piles. You and your opponent lay down cards as quickly as possible.          There are no turns, so both players continue to lay down cards as fast as they can. You can play as many cards in a row as you want without waiting for the other player to lay down anything. Draw a card from your draw pile of 15 cards every time you lay down a card from your hand, so that you have 5 cards in your playing hand at all times. After you run out of cards in your draw pile, continue to play out all 5 cards in your playing hand to win.  If neither player can lay down a card from their hand on either of the top cards in the middle, flip over a card from the far left or right 5-card reserve piles at the same time as your opponent. Place these cards on top of the piles in the middle and resume play from your hand.         Repeat this process any time game play halts due to neither player being able to lay down a card. If you run out of your left and right reserve piles, turn over the middle piles, shuffle them, and flip over the top card from each of them to resume play.  Be the first to get rid of all of your cards, slam your hands down on the middle piles, and yell “Speed!” to be the winner of the game.          Typically, Speed is played as a best-out-of-three game. The first player to win two games wins the set. But you can play for as many games as you like!  , Try modifying game play to allow players to play the same number card on one of the middle piles, in addition to playing ascending or descending cards.   For example, you could play a 5 on another 5 card, or a 4 or 6 as in normal game play. Play this variation if you want to make the game easier or go by faster.  Modify the game by agreeing with your opponent to be able to lay down more than one card at a time in ascending or descending order.   For example, if you have a 3, 4, and 5 in your hand, you can wait until you see a 2 or a 6 on a middle pile and then lay down all three cards at once onto the pile. Play with this variation if you want to make the game go by faster or just want an extra way to “attack” or best your opponent by getting rid of cards more quickly.  Try including the two Joker cards into your deck before dealing. If you get a Joker in your playing hand, use it on top of any card in the middle pile to act as a “wild.” Play any other card in your hand on top of the wild Joker, and play resumes normally on that card.   Try to hold onto a Joker in your hand as long as possible, only using it when you can’t play any of the other cards in your hand. A Joker must be played, however, when you can’t play any other cards and before you and your opponent can flip over reserve cards onto the middle piles. When you use Jokers in the deck, player draw piles should have 16 instead of 15 cards each. The Joker cannot be the last card you play to win the game.  Expand the game to include more than two players by creating an extra middle pile for each player. In this case, deal out cards to the middle piles first, then distribute playing cards evenly to each player. Everyone should still have 5 cards in their playing hand.   For three players, have three active middle piles for the players to lay cards on. For four players, have four active piles. Try using two decks instead of one when you're playing with more than two players for a longer game with more possibilities for game play.	Shuffle and deal player cards. Make 4 piles in the middle. Separate the top 5 player cards. Flip over the 2 middle cards. Pick up your 5-card hand. Lay down cards as quickly as possible. Flip over reserves when no one can play. Yell “Speed” when all your cards are gone. Play using doubles. Put down more than one card at a time. Use jokers as a wild card. Play with three or four players.
At minimum, you should have two blue clays, two yellow clays, one white clay, one transparent clay, and one black clay.   One blue should be slightly warm (with a hint of green) while the other should be slightly cool (with a hint of purple). Similarly, one yellow should be slightly warm (with a hint of orange) and the other should be slightly cool (with a hint of green). You can use more variations of blue and yellow clay, but starting with two each should provide you with a fairly accurate understanding of how to make your desired hue of green.  Pinch off equal amounts of the warm blue and the cool yellow. Smash the two pieces together and knead the resulting ball until evenly blended.   Roll, stretch, and knead the ball continuously to blend the colors. When finished, you should no longer see any streaks of blue or yellow in the sample. The finished color should be a relatively bright green since both the blue and yellow already leaned toward the color green., Combine equal portions of the blue and yellow clays, following the same procedure used to create the first sample of green. Continue until you've worked through all possible combinations.   The warm yellow and cool blue should create a dull green with hints of brown in it. The warm yellow and warm blue should create a medium-tone, warm green with strong yellow undertones. The cool yellow and cool blue should create a medium-tone, cool green with strong blue undertones.  Pick your favorite green hue and duplicate the sample as before. After mixing the green, mix in a small pinch of white.   Blend the white into the green until no streaks remain. The color should look less bright and should also gain a lighter tint. The more white you add, the lighter the tint will be.  Duplicate the same green used in the previous sample, but do not add any white to it. Instead, mix in a small amount of translucent clay.   Once blended, the translucent clay should make the green appear much less bright without changing the value or hue of the resulting sample. If you use more translucent clay than green, however, you'll end up with a semi-transparent wash of green instead of an opaque color.  Create the same green used as the base in your white and translucent experiments. This time, thoroughly mix a very small pinch of black into the green.   After blending the black into the green, the sample should develop a darker shade while remaining the same hue. In most cases, it won't take much black to dramatically darken the green, so you should only work in very small amounts.	Gather several samples of clay. Combine one blue clay with one yellow clay. Work through the remaining combinations. Add white to one sample. Add translucent clay to another sample. Add black to a final sample.
Many plants found in nature can be used to create a homemade, natural dye. You will need to follow the same basic procedure when separating the dye from the plant matter. To do so you should:   Chop up the plant or dye material into small pieces using a kitchen knife. Place two parts water and one part dye material in a large pot and boil it over high heat. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 1 hour. Strain the plant material out and pour the now colored liquid into a large bowl for you dye bath., Berries also carry rich pigments that give them color. These pigments can be separated from the fruit of the berry to create a potent, natural dye. To create your dye from berries you should:   Boil the berries for approximately 15 minutes or until the color of the berries mixed in with water. Separate the berry chunks by using a strainer and pour the colored liquid into a large bowl. Discard the berry chunks leaving only the colored solution to be used in dyeing the fabric., Using different plant materials, you can extract different color dyes. The following list is by no means exhaustive, but some popular colors and the plants they are made from include:    Orange: Onion skin and carrot roots  Brown: Coffee, tea, walnuts, and dandelion roots  Pink: Red raspberries, cherries, and strawberries  Blue/purple: Red cabbage, mulberries, elderberries, blueberries, purple grapes, cornflower petals, and purple irises  Red:Beets, rose hips, and St. John's Wort soaked in alcohol  Black: Iris roots  Green: Artichokes, spinach leaves, sorrel roots, lilac flowers, snapdragon flowers, black-eyed Susans, and grass  Yellow: Celery leaves, turmeric, willow leaves, marigold blossoms, paprika, peach leaves, yarrow, and alfalfa seeds	Boil, simmer and strain plant material when mixing natural dyes. Boil and strain berry-based material to make natural dyes. Choosing the right natural substance to make your dye.
Line up the edges to have a sharp point on one corner. (If you turn it sideways, it looks like half a trapezoid.) This step is essential to create a square piece of paper out of the rectangular paper. If you already have the pre-made square origami paper, then you can scroll down to part 2: Folding; however, you still need to make a diagonal crease of the paper. ; ,   You do not have to use a pencil if you do not feel the need to use it. Creating a line makes it easier to but the paper into two pieces. Now, the paper should be a square.    You are also free to color whatever color you would like your elephant to be. Do not be limited to conventional colors of what an elephant is meant to be. Remember, this is a fun craft that children can also enjoy to do.    The folded lines should form an X when the paper is in the square position. The folded creases will serve as a guide for future steps.    The paper is in a diamond or rhombus position. This step is necessary since it positions the paper for you to make the next step’s fold.    This part will form the top of the head of your elephant.    The paper should form a triangle. To achieve this step, you can also make the flaps overlap. The main goal of this step is to create the three corners of the triangle as best you can. Make note that the bottom corner is going to be the trunk, so you should make sure that the trunk is long and gradually gets narrower.    Each flap looks like a triangle. This step is a little tricky, but you can accomplish this step by using the right side of the middle upside-down triangle formed by step 3 of part 2 as a guide to fold the inner flap first. Then, you can fold the outer flap by lining up with the folded inner flap. The outer and inner flaps should also form a straight horizontal line. This step is necessary to serve as a guide for the next fold. This step’s folds create the ears of the elephant.    Remember to fold up to the horizontal line created by the last step.    This fold is like an accordion style fold. This is going to be the trunk, so you can decide for yourself how long you want the trunk to be. You should make sure the folds are straight and are parallel to the fold in step 5 of part 2. This way the trunk is not going to be slanted, and you will have a trunk pointing straight down.    You should not fold too much in. Fold in until you see a folded line. This step is going to shape the head of the elephant. This will imitate a rounder head and not a square and boxy head of an elephant.    This step is only necessary if you want to preserve the form of the elephant, and you do not want the folds to undo itself. To conserve on the amount of tape you want to use, you can use four pieces of tape and fold the top two corners and the sides of the trunk.    You have finished the origami—the folding—part of this craft, so the elephant is basically completed; however, you can continue on with the steps in order to create facial features of your elephant.    This is the basic facial features you can give your elephant. You can also add additional details to the face of your elephant. Some examples may include drawing the creases on the trunk or the pinks of the ears.    This is optional, and this can include other drawings or colors not involving the details of an elephant. You can add unrealistic features on the elephant to add more fun. Some examples may include drawing a bow or a mustache.    Get a new piece of paper and start over, or you could use a clear tape and tape the pieces together. To prevent this, take your time and be patient.    Go over the correct folds and fold them by pinching the folds harder. A tip on how to fold harder is to use the tips of your fingernails and pinch while sliding your nails across the paper. This makes the folds stay flatter. This will also allow these folds to stand out against the other folds. To prevent this, fold lightly at first then fold harder over the correct folds.    Color the areas again. To prevent this, use a different type of coloring utensil. Colored pencils can be the most inconsistent utensil. Markers will make the coloring consistent, but it will be difficult to draw the facial and other personalized features at the end. Crayons may be the best to use since they are more consistent and will allow you to draw other features at the end.	Fold the paper diagonally. Use a pencil and cut the bottom strip off. Color one side of your paper gray. Fold the paper diagonally again but in the other way. Position the paper so the colored side is on the back and the folded lines form a + sign. Fold the top tip of the paper to the middle. Fold the two flaps on the side inwards. Fold the inner flap then the outer flap outwards. Fold the bottom part up. Leave some room and fold that same part down. Fold the top two corners in. Tape the folded parts down. Flip the paper over. Draw the eyes and the mouth. Add whatever personalized features on the face to make it fun and unique. Paper rips. Too many folds. Inconsistent coloring spots.
If your house is older, your windows probably allow air to seep in. Single-paned windows don’t insulate as well as newer models. You can save up to $465 a year by replacing old single-pane windows with energy-efficient ones.In the U.S., several tax credits are available for replacing old windows with energy-efficient models. The US Department of Energy has a full list of these credits here., When chosen wisely, a skylight can provide beautiful natural light to your home while reducing your energy consumption. It’s important to consider your home’s position in order to maximize your skylight’s benefits. Consult a designer or architect.An eco-friendly skylight is more than a hole cut in the roof with some glass in it. Many energy-efficient skylights exist on the market, but they should always be professionally installed to make sure that they are safe and efficient.  Hardwood floors add value and beauty to a home, but many of the trees used in hardwood flooring take years to grow. If your house is up for a new floor, consider using sustainable materials such as bamboo instead. Bamboo grows very quickly and takes less land to produce, but it’s still attractive and durable.   Cork is another sustainable wood flooring option. Cork is softer than bamboo, so it absorbs noise and feels cushiony underfoot. It is sometimes less durable than bamboo., Shade trees can reduce the amount of energy you spend to cool your house on hot summer days. If your property doesn’t already have shade trees, this is a step that will take some time before you see the full benefit.In addition to providing shade, trees absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide and release oxygen. A single tree can produce enough oxygen for four people in a single day.If you’re building a new construction home, try to work around existing trees. You could even incorporate them into your house design, such as building a deck under a huge shady oak. Place deciduous trees (trees that shed their leaves annually) near the south and west sides of your home. This will help them block harsh afternoon sunlight in the summer, but let sunlight reach your home during the winter., This helps reduce your home’s energy consumption. It can also extend the life of your roof. These roofs are especially good for people who live in hot climates, since they reduce the need for air conditioning.Cool roof coatings are available at many home supply stores and warehouses. These coatings are like extremely thick paint and can be applied fairly easily. They are usually white or very light-colored with reflective pigments that reflect, rather than absorb, sunlight. (It is not recommended to apply cool roof coatings to shingle roofs.) If you have a steep-sloped shingled roof, consider replacing your current shingles with cool asphalt shingles. These shingles have specially fabricated granules that reflect sunlight. If you have a metal roof, it already reflects a lot of sunlight. However, these roofs absorb a lot of heat, which can increase your energy consumption in the summer. Painting your metal roof with a light color or using a cool roof coating can increase its energy efficiency.  Composting toilets usually do not use water to “flush” like traditional toilets. They can also recycle many types of human waste into fertilizer that can be used in agriculture. While they are initially more expensive to install than traditional toilets, they are far more eco-friendly and will eventually pay for themselves.Composting toilets are usually easiest to install and maintain in a rural or suburban setting. If you live in an apartment or urban high-rise, it may more difficult to install and maintain a composting toilet.  Materials such as cedar naturally repel pests and water. They are also durable and low-maintenance. Replace old aluminum siding with a more sustainable option.There are other eco-friendly siding options, such as fiber cement board and particle board. These are durable and sustainable. Look for products that have been manufactured without formaldehyde.  Because it takes all these factors into account, a whole-house systems approach can drastically reduce your energy consumption.Many designers and architects have experience in whole-house systems approach construction. Visit the National Association of Home Builders for more advice on finding a design team.	Replace old windows with energy-efficient windows. Install a skylight. Use sustainable flooring. Plant trees. Install a “cool roof.” Cool roofs reflect sunlight rather than absorbing it. Consider installing a composting toilet. Use durable siding. Talk with a design team about a “whole-house systems approach.” If you are designing a new home or doing extensive renovations on an older home, consider talking with a design team about a “whole-house systems approach.” This extensive approach considers many factors about your home, including local climate, your site’s specific conditions, your appliance needs, etc.
Making a vinegar-based cleaning solution that can disinfect, descale, and deodorize is an economic way to clean inside of your iron. This is also the easiest way to clean parts of the iron that are otherwise unreachable.; , Set the iron on its hottest setting. If your iron does not have a temperature dial, switch it to cotton on the fabric settings.  This is accomplished by holding down the steam button while pressing the iron into a hand towel on the ironing board. Vent the steam in 20-30 second bursts in this manner for a total of one and a half minutes.  If there is any solution left after venting, be sure to discard or repurpose it for something else. It has already run through the iron and is not needed in the following step.  This will ensure that all of the vinegar is removed from the iron’s ductwork and reservoir. Drain any remaining water from the reservoir. , The resulting slurry will act as a mild abrasive and help to remove stubborn buildup on the base plate of the iron. This is particularly useful when an iron’s base plate is scorched and no longer glides over the ironing board smoothly.  Spread an even layer of the slurry onto the base plate of the iron and gently wipe it with a dampened hand towel in a scrubbing motion. Remove any excess.  Continue scrubbing and removing buildup in a soft but deliberate manner being careful not to scratch the base plate. Damage to non-stick surfaces can lead to permanent discoloration and rust., Over time these can become clogged with minerals found in ordinary tap water. If your iron is having trouble producing steam, get rid of scale buildup in or around the steam ducts by using a toothbrush, toothpick, cotton swab, or other soft object to remove any visible residue from the area.  Some steam irons will have non-coated base or sole plates. Though these can be cleaned with the aforementioned salt and vinegar solution, they may benefit from a commercial iron cleaner as well. An extra-fine abrasive may be used as a last resort., Chill the iron by placing its base plate in a shallow bowl of ice water. This will firm up the plastic and allow for easy removal. Scrape any plastic away with a dull plastic knife, plastic spatula, or credit card edge. , Run a hot iron over a dryer sheet and then a hand towel. Alternate back and forth between the two. This will improve the luster of your iron by removing oils and small particles of scorched cloth or dust.  Depending upon the hardness of your local tap water, the durability of certain internal parts of your iron, and the frequency of use, your iron may call for specific kinds of water. Spring water is always appropriate; however, an equitable and less expensive option is filtered tap water., Note any damage, fraying, or kinks in the iron’s cord. Damage to this area might be a potential fire hazard. If damaged, discontinue use until the cord is repaired.  Never put unnecessary stress on the iron by storing it on its side or back. An iron should be stored sitting upright in an area where it is stable and will not fall. This is also a safety precaution and ensures that if the iron were heated, the base plate would not be touching a cloth surface that can be damaged as it heats.	Mix one half cup of water and one half cup of distilled white vinegar. Fill the water reservoir of the iron with the cleaning solution, and turn the iron on to heat. Run the cleaning solution through the inside of the iron when the iron is hot. Empty any remaining cleaning solution from the reservoir. Fill the reservoir with fresh water and repeat the steaming process. Mix equal parts table salt and distilled white vinegar. Apply the cleaning solution and wipe the base plate with a soft damp cloth. Reapply and repeat as many times as necessary until clean. Pay special attention to cleaning the steam ducts on the base plate of the iron. Use a store-bought iron cleaner if the base plate is not made of non-stick material. Remove any melted-on plastic from your iron. Use dryer sheets to keep your iron sparkling and smelling nice. Fill your iron’s reservoir with the appropriate kind of water. Check the power cord regularly. Store the iron properly.
An abused horse may have suffered physical abuse or neglect. Both leave scars in their own way. First off, get the horse examined by an equine vet. You will need to know the extent of any physical damage that has been done to the horse, and should have a frank discussion about the long term and ongoing cost of medication, should that be required.; , It is likely that basic health care, such as worming, vaccination, teeth and hoof care, are lacking. The veterinarian needs to examine the horse’s teeth to see if they need filing down.   The vet should also check the hooves to determine what remedial action is required to get them back into good condition.  In addition to other physical examinations, the veterinarian may take a fecal sample away for analysis to investigate what types of worms the horse may have. He or she will also decide on appropriate worming treatments. Worming treatment will be discussed in Method 2.   In the case of a starved horse the vet can also advise on how to gradually improve the horse's body condition in the way that is least likely to induce health problems. Weight gain will be discussed in Method 3.	Make an appointment with an equine vet for the abused horse. Have the vet check your horse for basic care issues. Find out if the horse has worms or other health issues.
You will need one plastic container, such as a water bottle, with a lid (do not use glass or anything that will break). Additionally you will need ammonia, a pair of scissors and one book of matches.Ammonia is a cleaning solution. Be careful with it.  Toss the wooden sticks and empty matchbook away – you will only need the match heads. Put the match heads inside your plastic bottle.   The match heads contain the sulfur you need to create this bomb. You could go out and buy the chemical sulfur in a powdered form, but this is generally hard to find and expensive. Match heads are much easier to find and safer to use.  Pour the ammonia over the match heads that you’ve already placed in the container. Fill up the container about halfway and then tightly screw the lid or cap back onto your container.Once you’ve put the lid on your stink bomb, allow it to sit for about 3-4 days. The chemicals inside will react and brew up the stench. Be careful not to spill the ammonia and be sure to recap it tightly and put it away after you use it. Never mix ammonia with bleach – it will create a highly toxic gas that can be lethal.  Don’t take the lid off until you’re ready! Hide the stink bomb near whoever it is you’re pranking (such as in your sibling’s room, under the kitchen table, etc.).   This bomb will smell terrible, like rotten eggs.Be careful not to spill any of it on yourself!	Gather your materials. Cut the match heads off of all the matches in the book.Using your scissors, carefully cut off the heads (the striking ends) of all of the matches in your matchbook. Fill the plastic bottle halfway up with ammonia. Remove the lid from the container when you’re ready to use the bomb.
A plastic cup or bowl is also preferable, since its lower mass will reduce the risk of damaging your wall or window during the trapping process. You can use any regular cup or bowl you might have around your house. While a bowl allows for a wider margin of error when trapping the bee, the cup is easier to keep covered and move out once the bee has been trapped.; , Do not wear shorts or T-shirts when trapping a bee in a container.  When you’re within six to twelve inches of the bee, rapidly bring the container over the bee, trapping it within.   Do not attempt to trap a bee which is on the carpet. The chances it will escape are too great.  When trapping bees with a bowl, you could use a folded newspaper, a full sheet of thick paper, or a manila envelope. When trapping bees within a cup, you could use a notecard or magazine.   Think about the radius of your cup or bowl’s open end and choose a cover which corresponds appropriately. Whatever you choose, it should be relatively thin.  Starting at one edge of the container, ease it up by about one or two millimeters. Slip your magazine or notecard beneath the container and continue to push it across the surface the bee was sitting on.   The bee will likely be surprised and fly about after having the container placed over it; this will make the process of easing the cover over your container that much easier.  With the cover safely over the container you've captured the bee in, move to an open door. Take the bee about ten paces from your home and remove the paper holding the bee in the cup or bowl you've trapped it in. Place the mouth of the cup or bowl on the ground, then slide the cover off. Ensure that it flies or crawls out and run quickly back to your home, closing the door firmly behind you before the bee can find its way back in.Don't take the bee too far away. Its hive is likely nearby and without access to it, it will surely die.	Obtain a cup or bowl.A clear bowl or cup is preferable, though not necessary. Wear a long-sleeved shirt and pants.Long-sleeved shirts and pants provide maximum coverage over your body, making it less likely for you to be stung. Trap the bee within your cup or bowl.When the bee has landed on a flat, smooth surface, slow bring the container of your choice toward the bee with one hand. Choose a cover for your container.You can use a wide variety of materials to cover the container which you have trapped the bee beneath. Place the cover between the bee and the surface it landed on.After choosing your cover, slip it slowly between the lip of the bowl or glass you trapped the bee under and the wall or hard surface on which the bee was sitting. Take the bee outside.
In a such a swap, two parties agree to swap equivalent amounts of cash (called principal) as well as interest rate payments over a fixed period of time. The cash usually originates as debt (a party issues a bond) or as credit (a party gets a loan). The principals exchanged are usually equivalent amounts: Party A swaps $1,000,000 for €750,000 from Party B, based on the exchange rate. The swapped interest rate payments, however, are usually not the same.   Here's a very basic example. Vitaly Partners, an Italian company, wants to hedge against the euro by buying dollars. Vitaly agrees on a currency swap with Brand USA, an American company. Over five years, Vitaly sends Brand USA €1,000,000 in exchange for the dollar equivalent, about $1,400,000. Vitaly agrees to swap interest payments with Brand USA as well: Vitaly will pay Brand USA 6% interest on its swapped principal, €1,000,000, while Brand USA will pay Vitaly 4.5% interest on its swapped principal, $1,400,000.; , The principal that the two parties agree to swap isn't actually exchanged. It is kept by both parties. The principal is what financiers call a notional principal, or an amount that is theoretically exchanged but actually kept. Why is the principal needed, then? It's needed to calculate the interest payments, which are the backbone of any currency swap.  Interest rate payments are usually swapped at six-month or one-year intervals, and this is where the parties transfer currencies that help them hedge against fluctuations in their own currency. Let's look at an example:   Vitaly agreed to swap €1,000,000 at 6% to Brand USA in exchange for $1,400,000 at 4.5%. Let's assume that interest rate payments are swapped every six months. Vitaly's interest rate payment will be calculated as follows: Notional principal x interest rate x frequency. Every six months, Vitaly will pay Brand USA €30,000, in euros. (€1,000,000 x .06 x .5 = €30,000.) Brand USA's interest rate payment will be calculated as follows: $1,400,000 x .045 x .5 = $31,500. Brand USA will pay Vitaly $31,500, in dollars, every six months.  For simplicity, this example so far has avoided a third party that's involved in the swap — banks. When Vitaly sends its interest payments over to Brand USA, it does so by sending the bank the interest payment first; the bank takes a small cut and sends the rest of the interest payment on over to Brand USA. Ditto for Brand USA: it must also mediate the transaction through the bank, which takes a small cut from their swap for granting the privilege.  Why choose currency swaps instead of just buying foreign currency? Currency swaps involve two parties. Remember Vitaly and Brand USA. Vitaly gets a better interest rate on its loan of €1,000,000 in Italy than it would if it asked for the loan in America. Likewise, Brand USA gets a better interest rate on its $1,400,000 loan in America than it would if it got the loan in Italy. By agreeing to exchange interest rate payments, currency swaps bring together two parties that each have better loan agreements in their own countries and their own currencies.	Swap currencies and interest rates with a party in a currency swap. Exchange interest payments in a currency swap, not principals. Calculate your interest rate payment. Work with a partnering financial institution to mediate the swap. Use currency swaps if you get better loan rates at home than you do abroad.
Dip a brush into watery paint. Hold it over the canvas and flick your wrist. Also try flicking bristles with your fingers or striking the brush handle. You can use a variety of brushes and other objects, including toothbrushes and sticks, to get different effects.Different objects, such as sticks or rods, can give you a less uniform drip than a paintbrush. They may have cracks and crevices the lead to a less controlled spatter.  Use liquid acrylics or thin out thicker paints. All you need to do is tip over the paint container and let the color flow onto the canvas. You can customize this in many ways, such as by pouring more paint, pouring a new color onto wet paint, and tilting the canvas. Pouring turns paint drips into broad, controlled shapes.Think of how you want to apply your paint. Every detail, including how high you hold the paint container, the angle, the volume, and your wrist movement, will change the effect the paint has on the canvas. For example, holding the paint container higher will cause more of a paint splash. Tilting the container more causes thicker paint drips. More paint in the container can help you get longer lines. Wrist movement can help you make paint lines thicker or thinner as you pour.  Hold a palette knife up to the container as you pour your paint. This will thin out the stream, causing the paint to look stringy and drizzled. Try it to get thinner paint lines with the same control as regular pouring., You can load the paint into a squeeze bottle or turkey baster. Squeeze the paint out over the top of an upright canvas. This will lead to very unique drip marks. You won’t have as much control as you would by dabbing areas with a brush, but no painting will turn out the same., Anything you have laying around can be repurposed for painting. Like how fingerpainting can give you more rounded paint lines, other tools will have their own effects. Sponges are useful for making clean, square-shaped marks. Fly swatters and potato mashers can give you patterned marks.Other examples include rolling pins, corn cobs, marbles, cookie cutters, metal rods, knives, rollers, and cards. They all help you apply different amounts of paint in unique patterns. The paint can be put on the canvas directly, splattered, dripped, or more.	Spatter paint for small drips. Pour paint for large drips. Use a knife while pouring for thinner drips. Squirt paint to create less controlled drip marks. Experiment with different painting tools.
Most fungi are fairly seasonal. You need to know when and where. The best times are usually the fall and the spring.; , Unlike flowers, who aim for the sun, fungi are usually where it is dank and dark. Quite often not in the nicest spots. Think under trees, usually rotting, in, or near, compost, in, or near, animal refuse, etc.  Quite often, because of the nature of the beast, the fungi are not 'photo ready'. They could be partially covered with dirt and leaves.  You will need to get down for most of the fungi and mushrooms you find. You will want to shoot at their level, or even below it.  Be sure you have some type of macro lens so that you can come in nice and close.  There are a few ways that you could do it. They are:   Use the flash to create a fill flash effect on the mushrooms.       Use an off camera flash or lighting. This will allow you to change the angle of the lighting more than an onboard flash will.       Use reflectors. Reflectors will use the available light and give you a more natural shot.  You could use a beanbag, a mini tripod, or even set it on the ground (carefully).  Mushrooms grow pretty slowly and don't move a lot, so you shouldn't have to worry too much about it moving.	Know the best time to shoot them. Know where to look for them. Clean it up. Don't be afraid to get dirty. Get up close. Put some thought into the lighting. Be sure that your camera is as stable as it can get. If your lighting is limited, use slower shutter speeds. Use a shallow depth of field to isolate the fungi in the shot.
Copyright law protects any original creation, and grants the holder of the copyright exclusive control over when, how, and by whom their work may be copied, distributed, or exhibited. This includes literary works, paintings, photographs, drawings, films, music (and its lyrics), choreography, sculptures and many other creative works.; , Copyright law generally does not protect the underlying ideas of a creative work, and it does not protect facts. For example, copyright doesn't prevent you from expressing in your own words ideas and facts found in a book or journal you read.   If you express ideas and facts in your own words, you should always give appropriate credit to the sources in which you found them. It is common courtesy to do so, and not doing so could constitute a violation of the Copyright Act. What you have created may constitute a derivative work pursuant to the Copyright Act, unless you have obtained license or permission from the copyright holder to create the work. It may also constitute plagiarism under state common law. Paraphrasing other people's work may also constitute plagiarism under state common law, and may run afoul of misappropriation statutes.  The term "intellectual property" itself has led to these very different things being confused with each other.   As Richard Stallman says, "Non-lawyers who hear one term applied to these various laws tend to assume they are based on a common principle, and function similarly. Nothing could be further from the case. These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues."Trademarks, for example, forbid using certain words, marks, symbols, and so on within certain contexts to protect consumers from misrepresentation. Copyright would not prevent you from, for example, writing some new text editor software and calling it "Microsoft Text Editor", but trademark law would.  "Public domain" is short-hand for "uncopyrighted", not "publicly distributed". A work can be out of copyright due to age, by the nature of authorship, or other reasons. In the United States, all works authored by a federal government (not state government!) employee during the course of their official duties are public domain, as are all works published before 1923. Works first created in the European Union will usually be copyrighted until 70 years after the death of the author.  "I found it on the Internet" is not a defense against copyright infringement; works on the Internet are as copyrightable as any other kind of work. Nor is "it didn't say it was copyrighted."   In nearly all jurisdictions, including the United States, and all other Berne Convention signatories, it is not necessary for a work to have an explicit copyright notice for it to be copyrighted.It is also not necessary for copyright in a work to be registered; this simply makes it easier to be compensated in court. Without an explicit dedication to the public domain, assume that it is still under copyright. There is a quirk in the United States' implementation of the Berne Convention: works first published before 1978 without a copyright notice may be public domain in the United States.Works published under copyright notice are no longer covered by copyright after 75 years. They become public domain material. Works published by the US Government are public domain no matter when they were published.  If ever you wonder whether a certain action would infringe on the copyright of someone else, the question to ask is: is this a creative work on my count, or am I simply drawing from the creativity of someone else? Lunches, as any economist would tell you, are not free. Some examples:   Scanning something yourself does not, by itself, give you a new copyright over anything. You cannot scan a photograph from, say, a magazine and then put it on the Internet; the copyright would still reside with the author of the work. The flip-side of this is that scanning a work which is in the public domain would not, in many jurisdictions, give you the copyright over the resulting scan. Taking a screenshot of a video or a computer program does not generate a new copyright. The copyright in the resulting screenshot would still be held by the copyright holder of the original video or computer program. Some non-creative things are not copyrightable, for example, a plain text logo in a generic font. Neither are simple geometric shapes. But don't rely on this unless you are certain.  Called "fair dealing" in many jurisdictions, fair use is simply a guarantee that copyright laws do not infringe freedom of speech and make critical commentary impossible. Fair use is an extremely complex body of case law; it is often very difficult for non-lawyers to tell in advance whether or not a certain use will be considered fair use in court. If in doubt, seek permission first. It is not a blank cheque granting you a right to do anything at all and call it "fair use".   Some uses of text under "fair use" are teaching, critiques, comments, reporting, and research. It permits, for example, limited quoting of copyrighted material. In some jurisdictions, it would allow creating a copy for personal use (such as a backup).  It was said above that "ideas cannot be copyrighted". However, fictional characters,story-lines, and settingscan be copyrighted (insofar as they are original).   This means that fan-fiction, drawings of characters from copyrighted works, and so on are all technically copyright infringements. Sometimes copyright holders turn a blind eye to this sort of thing, but unless it has been explicitly authorised, don't count on this being the case. Stock Characters, on the other hand, can not be copyrighted or trademarked.	Know what copyrights protect. Know what isn't protected. Don't confuse copyrights, trademarks, and other forms of "intellectual property.", Learn about the public domain laws for your jurisdiction. Don't take anything from the Internet, or anywhere else, because it is almost always copyrighted, by default. Be creative. Don't rely on "fair use". Be wary about writing fiction based on other works.
This example will use cardboard and wire, since just about anybody can readily obtain and cut them, but a sturdier or more attractive model could use balsa wood, Popsicle sticks, wood, stiff craft foam, metal, or found materials such as a container lid. Choose materials according to what you can find and whether you can work with them easily.; , The base simply supports the other mechanism parts and provides pivot points for the rotating members. In this cardboard model, a large sheet of cardboard cut from the side of a cereal box will serve as the base.  The crank needs two pivot points. They may be on a circular cutout as shown here, or they may be on either end of a short rectangular piece. If you'd like a circle, use a compass or trace around a circular object of a suitable size, such as a can or glass. Make a hole in the center of the crank and make another near the edge of the circle. For a linear crank, make holes near each end. Don't put any holes too close to the edge.  Make it about twice as long as the distance between the two holes. Make holes near either end of the shaft.  This can be a simple rectangle of whatever material you are using. If you will place the slider into a tube, such as a pipe, you may prefer a cylindrical object, such as a cork or a piece of dowel or rod. Place a hole in one end of the slider.  For a two-dimensional cardboard model, you can use rectangles folded and glued to your base. Make these retainers two times as long as the crank, plus the length of the slider.  This model uses craft wire and buttons, but any assemblage that will fit freely through the holes and hold the pieces together while allowing them to rotate against each other will do. , If you're making a two-dimensional model on a base of wood or cardboard, place the shaft on top of the crank.  In a two-dimensional model, place the slider under the shaft.  Arrange the retainers on either side of it so that it has a path to move and fasten them down. Glue or even staples will do for paper.	Choose materials. Create a base. Cut out the crank. Cut out the shaft. Cut out the slider. Fashion a means of retaining the slider along a linear path. Prepare pivots. Put a hole in your base material and create a pivot between the center (or one end) of your crank and the base.  , Create a pivot between the crank and the shaft. Create another pivot between the shaft and the slider. Rotate the crank so that the slider is in its fully retracted position.
How often you should feed your frog will vary depending on the species. ACF tadpoles should be fed daily, while adult ACFs should be fed every 2-3 days. As ADF frogs are smaller in size, they must eat smaller quantities of food more often. Both ADF tadpoles and ADF adults should be fed 1-2 times per day., In general, ACFs and ADFs can consume the same diet. The only major difference is that ADFs must have their food broken down into much smaller pieces for them. Additionally, ADFs will consume much smaller portions.There is not an exact science to portion sizes for frogs. Start with a small amount of food at each feeding, and gradually increase until you have an understanding for how much your frog likes to eat.  Both ACFs and ADFs can eat pellet food for aquatic life. You can find this pellet food at any pet store. Pellet food is particularly important for tadpoles of either species, but it should also be a staple component of adult frog diets. Simply sprinkle a small amount in your frog’s tank at each feeding.You will want “sinking pellets.” Do not feed your frogs “flake” fish food.  Bloodworms, brine shrimp, and mysis shrimp are other staples in the diets of ACF and ADF frogs. Look for these items at your local pet store. You may find them fresh, dried, or frozen, all of which are good options for your frogs. If you have ADF frogs, be sure to break up the food into small pieces.When using frozen food, be sure to thaw beforehand.	Determine how often you should feed. Serve food the right size. Sprinkle pellet food in the tank. Provide bloodworms, brine shrimp, and mysis shrimp.
Avoid the temptation to begin formulating a response before getting to the very last word in the correspondence. As you read the entire text, other insights may come to mind that will make it much easier to provide a truly constructive response.; , Let customers immediately know you care for and plan on investigating their concerns, there is personnel responsible for such actions, and a solution will be reached. Try a few of the following replies to personalize your own:   At (business name), we are 100% committed to meeting the needs of our customers. One of our customer representatives will reply within 24-hours. In an effort to monitor and improve customer satisfaction at (business name), we would like to inform you we take all feedback seriously, and will reply to your concern as soon as possible. We appreciate your concern and hope to keep your future business. Please allow us some time to investigate your issue and determine a suitable solution. Whenever possible, go one step further and personally acknowledge the receipt. This is especially important if it will take time to gather the information necessary to adequately respond to customer queries, concerns, or suggestions.  There are customer software packages that do this for you, but in general there should be a way to identify the customer, their contact information, and their specific complaint. Be sure to include enough information, like a unique ID number, in case the customer has more than one bad experience.  Before determining who is at fault, what the reply should be, and what solution will be provided, try to really identify with the customer. Imagine previous scenarios where you’ve been unhappy with a business, and formulate the type of answer that would have satisfied you then., At times, clients may be very direct, while at other times their words may hint at additional concerns. If there is question, do not guess at the client’s intentions.Get clarification by asking a question.  Sift through the email to remove the concerns from vitriol. Try to break down the email into three different sections.   Identify what should be directly addressed. These items need immediate and concise answers. Pick out what needs further clarification. If there are uncertain demands or complaints, be sure to find the items that need return questions to the customer. Pay attention to any time-sensitive items. If a customer is unhappy with their service or product, and needs attention before a certain cut-off date, be aware of their scheduling concerns.  When a customer takes the time to send an email, you are being given the opportunity to overcome obstacles and strengthen the relationship. Make it clear the customer is valuable and you will find a way to provide concise answers that solve their issues.  Sometimes all a customer wants is acknowledgement of an error, bad service provided, or an unsatisfactory product. Try one of the following to assuage the customer:   Sorry for our mistake. We’ll work harder next time to make your experience wonderful. We’d like to offer our sincerest apologies. The same mistake will not be made again. Oops! We definitely didn’t live up to expectations with your last interaction. We’ll try to do better in future visits.  Many companies have a policy of answering emails within 24 business hours or less. Make sure your client knows when a reply can reasonably be expected.  An easy way is to respond to each point in the same order as listed in the original email. This will often make it easier for the client to quickly relate the responses to his or her comments, since the flow of answers is in sync with the arrangement of the customer's text.  Should any comment expressed by the client be unclear in some manner, pose questions designed to obtain more detail. Avoid phrasing your questions so that simple yes or no responses are likely. Ideally, you want enough detail in return to fully address any remaining issues on the client's mind.   Can you please explain the customer service interactions with which you are unhappy? Which items did you purchase, and which are unsatisfactory? Would you please provide the details of the sales transaction, including the date, time, and sales ID number?  , Customers that are upset are unlikely to respond kindly to anything except acknowledgement and understanding of their complaint.   The customer is always right. Under nearly all scenarios, it does not behoove you to blame the customer for a mistake. Chalk up any interactions like this as a way to win over a customer. Do not get into an argument with the customer via email. Keep attempting to resolve the situation by offering multiple solutions to the problem. Offer realistic answers. While some difficult customers may ask for unrealistic outcomes, it’s best not to even suggest something that can’t be delivered. Only mention what can be done to remedy the problem., Even if a client wants something that cannot be done, don't respond negatively. Include what solutions are available to address the underlying issue, especially if the fault is with your company. Ultimately, clients are more interested in what providers can do rather than what they can't.   Thanks for the email. We’ve found the source of the error and are would like to recompense you with 15% off of your previous order. We appreciate the time you’ve spent to contact us. We’d like to offer you a full refund on the faulty product. Thank you for your business! Sorry for shipping the incorrect item to you. We’ve already sent a replacement via overnight shipping. Please consider the first item a gift. Your email has brought attention to a problem of which we were unaware. Thank you. Please use the attached coupon and accept a complimentary meal on your next visit. Ask the customer for suggestions. They may find your solution insufficient. Provided the request is reasonable, it’s possible you’ll gain a valued customer by allowing them to dictate their own terms., Ensure your company follows through with the solution provided, and the customer is satisfied. Never leave an issue unresolved.	Read the customer's email carefully. Acknowledge the customer email as quickly as possible. Track all customer interaction. Put yourself in the customer’s position. Consider the questions or concerns in the client's email. Make a list of specific issues. Thank the customer for the email. Apologize for any wrong-doing. Set reasonable expectations for responding with answers. Address each topic mentioned in the customer email. Ask clarifying questions. Handle angry customers with care. Offer solutions without excuses. Monitor follow-up correspondence with the customer.
Cut a variety of different berries in half or slices, for example blueberries and strawberries, slice a banana, or sprinkle some raisins on top. Pour in skimmed or low fat milk instead of 2% or chocolate milk. Try to eat whole grain rather than sugar cereals.; , Papaya, mango, cantaloupe (rock melon), and oranges are popular fruits to eat at breakfast time. Be sure to remove any inedible seeds and peel off any inedible or just unpleasant skin before consuming fruit of any kind.  You can create so many varieties of vegetable omelets with peppers, chopped white/green onions, mushrooms, spinach or kale and a whole lot more. After you take the eggs off the burner, sprinkle or layer on cheese slices for additional taste. This is a great idea for Lacto Ovo Vegans.  Choose the 100% juices for kids over the types or brands that look appealing to them.  Anything that's sweet and sugary, looks great on the side with coffee drinks, or as a "side dish" doesn't contribute to a healthy breakfast. Remember that most desserts contain empty calories, so instead of choosing a cinnamon roll, eat a bagel or English muffin.  and so on. Look for interesting recipes on the internet.	Make your cereal or oatmeal more nutritious. Have at least 1/2 cup of fresh fruit with your breakfast. Toss some vegetables into your pan of eggs. Drink calcium fortified juices, like orange juice. Limit the pastries. Another option is to bake your favorite breakfast pastries at a healthier version on your own, for example: Whole-grain, sugar-free cakes/muffins/granola bars; baked oatmeal with fruit and nuts (a great alternative to regular cooked oatmeal, because you can make ahead and refrigerate it); savory muffins with veggies (carrot, zucchinis, tomatoes... Whatever you like!)
Mix together 1 Tablespoon (14.7 ml) of baking soda with 1 Tablespoon (14.7 ml) of vinegar to make a thick paste. (Add a bit more more liquid or powder as needed to create a consistency similar to peanut butter). Grab a clean wash cloth, rinse it with warm water, and wring out completely. Then use your washcloth to pick up some of the paste., Dab the paste onto any location with stuck on food or stains. Allow the paste to sit for 3-5 minutes. Then scrub these spots using a soft-bristle brush until the food/stains are gone.If you do not have a soft-bristled brush, you can use a damp washcloth or the textured side of a kitchen sponge.  Wipe down any places where paste was applied with a clean washcloth and warm water. Be sure to remove any remaining paste. Dry using a soft cloth or towel.	Create a paste from vinegar and baking soda. Apply this paste to stubborn stains. Rinse with warm water and dry.
To start ,make sure you have soldiers whom you trust; maybe like 8 trusted friends who want to join in. Give them forms to fill in with their trust to be a part of the team. Also test them if they have the power to take part of the group. After the paperwork give them badges or ID-cards to recognize them as team members.; , Take votes with your team members what they think the spy club name should be. Make the name sound real for example...United Government Intelligence(U.G.I). The most votes wins the title.  Your team needs fitness and muscles. Teach them the basics first then so on. After their warm up, start to heat the training up. Record their training and test them for ranks.  After the training look at there record sheets and test sheets.Choose who looks like the winning team member.Here are some ranks for your team or change them if you want to for team.   Head Spy-In charge of the whole organization. Vice-spy-In charge of the organization if Head spy is sick. Governors-Situates the buildings roads and tracks for the spy club. Senators-Goes to other places of spy clubs and talks to the head spy's. Supreme Judges-Has the power to suspend licenses. Councilors-In charge of discussing, situating votes and goes to other spy club meetings. Spy agent-Goes wearing a disguise and getting information from bad gangs. Employees-Just recruited personals.  Find a place in your backyard or hiding place to set up your spy base.	Recruit members. Create a spy club name. Train. Assign ranks. Spy Base: Just like real agencies have a base or building to meet or to finding information.
After a year or so of storage, the tape will not just pull off easily and a "preconditioning" of WD-40 will loosen it right up.; , If you are careful, it may go faster if you use a single-edged razor blade as a scraper before you shoot the adhesive reside with WD-40.  For the single-edged razor you need to have a blade holder so you have a grip of some kind to ensure that you can control the angle of the blade. That will cost you less than $2 if you have to buy one.  However, it will work if you don't "precondition" the tape with WD-40.  Work with the grain of the wood, rather than working across the grain.  Keep the razor at about a 2 to 4 degree angle to the wood. You don't need to get obsessive and measure the angle; just don't dig into the wood. If the blade starts to carve wood, you will feel the resistance to motion instantly. , It may be very soft and ready to wipe off, or you may need to shoot it with WD-40 again. If you cannot wipe it off with a cloth, shoot it again and wait another 10 minutes.  Use the same method: work with the shallow angle slowly, and with gentle motion.   You will be amazed at how easy this is. The WD-40 softens the tape goop and lubricates the blade, so it is less likely to dig into the wood. It is smooth as silk, but it will still leave a very thin layer of tape goop behind.  Wipe the remaining very thin, almost invisible, and with the layer of adhesive off.	Spray the WD-40 onto the tape without trying to remove the tape first. Spray it and let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes. Try it both ways and decide for yourself. Understand that if you sprayed the tape with WD-40 first, this will probably go a bit easier. Use your razor scrapper at a very shallow angle to the wood, and gently peel the tape off. Go slowly. Stop and work from the other direction, always with the grain of the wood.  , Understand that the first pass at removing the tape, with or without WD-40, will leave tape adhesive on the wood. Keep in mind that the razor scrapper can be used on the softened adhesive residue very effectively. Use a soft cloth, like a terry washcloth.
Carpenter ants are large black or dark brown insects with three body segments and six legs. They have bent antennae. The worker ants are wingless, while the reproductive ants have wings. They tend to walk in long trails. Termites, which are a far worse problem to have, have straight antennae and light colored bodies. If you're dealing with termites, read this article.; , Frass is a sawdust-like material left behind when ants bore into wood to make their nests. It will contains body parts and debris, but will basically look like a pile of light wood shavings. If you see this around your house, it's a telltale sign you've got an ant problem on your hands.  Wood that is serving as a nest for ants will have slits or holes. You'll usually see frass scattered nearby as well. Ants like to nest in walls, hollow doors, cabinets, beams, and structural wood. Look for areas where the wood is slightly damp, since ants like to build their nests in moist wood.  To find the nest, you'll need to lure the ants out with some bait, then trail them back to the nest so you can figure out exactly where they're hiding. Set out very small bits of honeydew or another sugary fruit near where you believe the nest to be located.  When the ants take the bait, follow them back to the nest. You'll probably see them crawl into a space in the wall, a cabinet, or a door. Keep watching until you're sure where the nest is located.   If the nest is visible and accessible, you can get rid of the nest itself by moving to the next step. If the nest is hidden and difficult to reach, you're going to want to use the toxic bait to kill the ants. It will take about three days to go into effect.  This method is best to use if the nest is hidden or inaccessible. You'll use toxic bait to lure the ants out of the nest; they'll carry it back to the nest, and within about three days the ant population will be poisoned. Buy some carpenter ant toxic gel bait and mix it with a spoonful of sugar and a spoonful of milk. Set some out near where you suspect the ants live. Wait for the ants to come out and take the bait.   It is essential that the bait you use be slow acting. If it kills the worker ants on their way back to the nest, the thousands of ants still back at the nest won't be affected. Choose a bait that takes about three days to work.Never spray the line of carpenter ants you see coming from the nest with insecticide. This won't harm the ants still lying in wait, and could actually cause them to sense danger and spread out to build more nests.If you have pets or small children, tamper-resistant bait stations are a safer option for dispensing toxic baits.  This method is effective when you can access the nest easily and apply carpenter ant dust directly to the queen and the entire colony. Choose a carpenter ant dust and follow the instructions on the package to apply the dust to the nest.   Diatomaceous earth is a natural, nontoxic dust that can be used to kill carpenter ants without bringing poisons into your home. Other chemical dust such as Delta Dust and Drione Pest Insecticide Dust is also effective, but it does contain toxins and could pose health risks to pets and children.    Buy boric acid at a garden supply store. Mix with powdered sugar, in a ratio of about 1/3 sugar to 2/3 boric acid. Fill bottle caps with the mixture. Set down around the area where you observe the ants. When they return it to the nest, it will kill the ants in the nest. Boric acid penetrates the ant's body and dissolves inside of the ant.  Do this by cleaning floors well, fixing any leaky faucets that might dampen wood, and removing any clutter that creates shelter for them.  Use caulk to seal your foundation and cracks around doors, windows, and any other areas where ants could get into your home. Install screens on your windows and doors.  Cut tree limbs back so they aren't hanging directly over your house. Clean up weeds, leaves, wood piles, and other natural debris that's close to your house and could be harboring an ant population.  Ants need sugar, protein and water sources to survive. Keeping these basic needs away from them is the best way to prevent them from infesting your home. Keep the floors and counters free of crumbs and clean up spills, especially sugary spills. Fix faucet leaks and make sure there's no accessible water in the area.	Make sure you're dealing with ants, not termites. Look for frass. Look for wood damage. Set out bait nearby. Trail the ants to the nest. Use the toxic bait method. Destroy the nest with direct dusting. Try a boric acid bait. Clean up your house to make it a bad breeding ground for carpenter ants. Seal your house. Remove natural debris from around the home. Clean up crumbs and water leaks.
Asset utilization can be calculated using any sales or revenue figure. However, the most commonly used number is net sales, which represent the total revenue collected over a period minus any discounts, returns, or allowances for damaged or missing products. This number is typically reported on a business's income statement as "net sales" or simply "sales."  To find net sales, reduce gross sales by the total amount of all returns, discounts, and damaged or missing goods.Determine a period over which you want to measure asset utilization and record the net sales collected in that period.  For example, a company might have $10,200,000 in sales for a given year. However, they lost $200,000 on returns, discounts, and damages, leaving them with $10,000,000 in net sales.  ; , Average total assets represents the total assets held by the business over the period in which asset utilization is being calculated. It can be calculated by adding the total assets at the beginning of the period plus the total assets at the end of the period and then dividing the total by two. Total assets includes all assets held by the business, including cash and cash equivalents, fixed assets, receivables, and others. Total assets should be stated on the business's balance sheets for each period.You can make a more specific analysis of asset utilization by only including assets directly used in production, such as plant equipment and property.  For example, the company in the previous example might have assets of $7,500,000 at the beginning of the year and $8,500,000 at the end of that year. Their average total assets would then be the sum of the two ($16,000,000) divided by 2, which is $8,000,000.    , Asset utilization or, more specifically, asset turnover is calculated quite simply. The formula for asset utilization is Net SalesAverage Total Assets{\displaystyle {\frac {\text{Net Sales}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}}}. In other words, the formula calculates how many dollars of sales are created per dollar of assets held by the business. Place your data for net sales and average total assets into the equation to calculate asset turnover.For the company from the previous example, this would be $10,000,000$8,000,000{\displaystyle {\frac {\$10,000,000}{\$8,000,000}}}   , Solve your equation by dividing net sales by average total assets. Your result will be a number, rather than a dollar amount. Continuing with the previous example, if a company had net sales of $10,000,000 and $8,000,000 in average assets, they would have an asset turnover of $10,000,000÷$8,000,000{\displaystyle \$10,000,000\div \$8,000,000}, or 1.25{\displaystyle 1.25}., Asset turnover is not the only way to calculate asset utilization. Another common measure of roughly the same performance metric is known as return on assets. This ratio compares net income, rather than sales, to total assets. Net income represents the company's profit (their "bottom line") over the period. Calculate return on assets using the following equation: Return on Assets=Net IncomeAverage Total Assets{\displaystyle {\text{Return on Assets}}={\frac {\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}}}., Accounts receivable turnover is another financial ratio that measures how effective the business is at collecting money it is owed. Use the formula Accounts Receivable Turnover=Net Credit SalesAverage Accounts Receivable{\displaystyle {\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover}}={\frac {\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}}} to calculate this ratio. Net credit sales are all sales made on credit minus any returns, discounts, or allowances for damaged or lost goods., After calculating accounts receivable turnover, you can easily find the average collection period. This represents how long, on average, an amount stays in the accounts receivable account before being collected. Calculate this ratio using the following formula: Average Collection Period=365 DaysAccounts Receivable Turnover{\displaystyle {\text{Average Collection Period}}={\frac {\text{365 Days}}{\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover}}}}. A long collection period may mean that the business is susceptible to cash flow shortages., Another way to measure asset utilization is to look at how well a business manages its inventory. This can be done by calculating inventory turnover. Calculate this ratio using the following formula: Inventory Turnover=Cost of Goods SoldAverage Inventory{\displaystyle {\text{Inventory Turnover}}={\frac {\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}}}. Cost of goods sold can be found on a business's income statement.   A small inventory turnover means that the company stores inventory for a longer period of time. This, in turn, increases storage costs and can mean lost sales opportunities., Once you have inventory turnover, you can calculate the average age of an item in inventory using the following formula:Average Inventory Age=365 DaysInventory Turnover{\displaystyle {\text{Average Inventory Age}}={\frac {\text{365 Days}}{\text{Inventory Turnover}}}}. This is simply another way of looking at inventory turnover. Like all other ratios, this one can be compared to its historical values over time for the business or to the same ratio for a competing business., In general, asset utilization is a measure of how well a business is able to utilize their assets to produce revenue. A relatively high ratio means that the company is efficient in using their assets, whereas a low one may indicate poor asset management. How high a specific business's asset utilization ratio should be depends on its industry and stage in its lifecycle. From another angle, a low asset utilization ratio may indicate over-investment in assets., Asset turnover is most commonly used to compare the performance of one business or company to that of a competitor or the industry average. Because of operational differences, comparing asset turnover for businesses in different industries does not provide for an accurate comparison. Look for industry asset turnover averages in industry publications or use financial statements from a competing company to obtain figures that you can compare your asset turnover to.   Asset turnover averages vary widely between industries. Whereas retail companies may have asset turnovers well over 2.00, financial and utilities companies may be close to 0., You can also compare the asset turnover of a business to its own historical asset turnover ratios. Ideally, a business should experience an increasing asset turnover ratio over time, due to either efforts to increase efficiency or economies of scale. Plot asset turnover over several different periods to assess whether or not asset turnover is increasing or decreasing for the business in question., While asset utilization can be useful in assessing business performance, it is not enough to make a complete assessment of the business. You need to combine asset utilization with other measures of performance and risk to determine how well the business is being managed. For example, you can combine asset utilization measures with profit margin and leverage ratios to get an overall idea of the business's performance.	Locate net sales information for the period. Calculate average total assets. Set up your equation. Divide to get asset utilization. Find your return on assets. Calculate accounts receivable turnover. Convert your result to the average collection period. Determine inventory turnover. Find the average age of inventory. Analyze your result. Compare the result to that of competing companies. Gauge efficiency over time. Use asset utilization as part of a broader analysis.
Development of moss and other organic growths will vary, depending on the climate where you live. Once you see these growths start to appear on your roof, go through the cleaning process to remove them as soon as possible. Organic growths multiply quickly, so the faster you nip them in the bud, the better., Damaged tiles invite mold spores and mildew to grow on your roof more quickly than they would otherwise. Minor damage can become major and costly unless dealt with in a timely manner. Routinely inspect your roof for damage, especially after inclement weather. Replace and repair the tiles as needed., Immediately after you clean your tile roof is the perfect opportunity to strengthen it with a fresh coat of sealer, primer and paint. You don’t need to do this each time you clean your roof, but keep this in mind and take the opportunity to do it every few years, immediately after a treatment.	Perform regular cleanings. Repair minor damage as needed. Consider resealing, repriming and repainting the tiles.
All species of fly produce maggots which are also called fly larvae but not all flies lay their eggs in trash or rotting meat. Fruit flies are the ones that lay eggs in fruit such as apples. Bee fly larvae are parasitic and eat the larvae of other insects. The ones that lay eggs in trash are called filth flies.   Blow fly, family Calliphoridae are commonly referred to bottle flies. This nickname comes from their coloring, which can be iridescent blue, green or copper. They can be rather pretty but their maggots can reach full size within 3 days after being laid as eggs by the female. They reproduce rapidly during the warm weather. Some species also have an adaptable appetite for sweets as well, which is why they are found feeding on flower nectar and leftover sugars on food containers.         House fly, Musca domestica is very easily recognizable by it's dull gray to brown body. Females live for about 3 to 4 weeks before laying 60 to 100 eggs. They reproduce less abundantly than blow flies but also will cause maggots in manure and rotting vegetation.        Little house fly, Fannia Canicularis is similar to the house fly but smaller. Their life cycle is 3 to 4 weeks. They also rest with wings held to together.  Stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans and False stable fly, Muscina Stabulans look similar to house flies but have checkerboard markings and are smaller. Stable fly has a painful bite as well as sucks blood from mammals and False Stable Fly does not. These species can live for 17 to 50 days and lay eggs in soiled pet bedding and food dishes. The False Stable fly also lays eggs in dead insects and bird nests to feed it's parasitic larvae. Both can lay eggs in tainted meat products as well.;	Learn the identity of the species of fly that lays eggs in the trash can that produce maggots.
This is the rate of return an investor could expect on an investment in which his or her money is not at risk, such as U.S. Treasury Bills for investments in U.S. dollars and German Government Bills for investments that trade in euros. This figure is normally expressed as a percentage.  These figures are also expressed as percentages. Usually the rates of return are figured over several months.   Either or both of these values may be negative, meaning that investing in the stock or the market (index) as a whole would mean a loss during the period. If only one of the two rates is negative, the beta will be negative.  If the stock's rate of return is 7% and the risk-free rate is 2%, the difference would be 5%.  If the market or index rate of return is 8% and the risk-free rate is again 2%, the difference would be 6%.  This fraction is the beta figure, typically expressed as a decimal value. In the example above, the beta would be 5 divided by 6, or 0.833.   The beta of the market itself (or the appropriate index) is by definition 1.0, as the market is being compared to itself, and any number (except zero) divided by itself equals 1. A beta of less than 1 means that the stock is less volatile than the market as a whole, while a beta greater than 1 means the stock is more volatile than the market as a whole. The beta value can be less than zero, meaning either that the stock is losing money while the market as a whole is gaining (more likely) or that the stock is gaining while the market as a whole is losing money (less likely). When figuring beta, it is common, though not required, to use an index representative of the market in which the stock trades. For U.S. stocks, the S&P 500 is the index usually used, although analysis of an industrial stock may be better served by comparing it against the Dow Jones Industrial Average. There are several other indexes that could be used appropriately. For stocks that trade internationally, the MSCI EAFE (representing Europe, Australasia, and the Far East) is a suitable representative index.  This is the same value as described above under "Calculating Beta for a Stock." For this section, we'll use the same example value of 2 percent, as used above.  In this example, we'll use the same 8 percent figure, as used above.  For this example, we'll use a beta value of 1.5. Using 2 percent for the risk-free rate and 8 percent for the market rate of return, this works out to 8 - 2, or 6 percent. Multiplied by a beta of 1.5, this yields 9 percent.  This produces a sum of 11 percent, which is the stock's expected rate of return.   The higher the beta value for a stock, the higher its expected rate of return will be. However, this higher rate of return is coupled with an increased risk, making it necessary to look at the stock's other fundamentals before considering whether it should be part of an investor's portfolio.  The first column will be your date column. In the second column, put down index prices; this is the "overall market" you'll be comparing your beta against. In the third column, put down the prices of the stock for which you are trying to calculate beta.  Try starting with one-month intervals. Pick a date — for example, at the beginning or end of the month — and input the corresponding value for the stock market index (try using the S&P 500) and then the stock price for that day. Try picking 15 or 30 recent dates, perhaps extending a year or two into the past. Note the index price and the stock price for each date.   The longer time frame you choose, the more accurate your beta calculation will become. Historical beta changes as you monitor both the stock and the index for a longer time.  One column will be for the returns of the index; the second column will be the returns of the stock. You'll be using an Excel formula to determine the returns, which you'll learn in the following step.  In the second cell of your index-return column, type an "=" (equals sign). With your cursor, click the second cell in your index column, type a "-" (minus sign), and then click on the first cell in your index column. Next, type a "/" ("divide by" sign), and then click on the first cell in your index column again. Hit "Return" or "Enter."   Since return is a calculation over time, you won't put anything in your first cell; leave it blank. You need at least two data points to calculate returns, which is why you'll start on the second cell of your index-returns column. What you're doing is subtracting the more recent value from the older value and then dividing the result by the older value. This just gives you the percent of loss or gain for that period. Your equation for the returns column might look something like this: =(B3-B2)/B2  , Do this by clicking on the small square at the bottom right of your index-return cell and dragging it down to the bottom-most data point. What you're doing is asking Excel to replicate the same formula (above) for each data point.  After finishing, you should have two columns, formatted as percentages, which list the returns for both the stock index and the individual stock.  Highlight all the data in the two return columns and hit the Chart icon in Excel. Select a scatter chart from the list of options. Label the X-axis with the name of the index you're using (e.g. S&P 500) and the Y-axis with the name of the stock you're using.  You can do this either by selecting the trendline layout in newer versions of Excel or by finding it manually by clicking in Chart → Add Trendline. Make sure to display the equation on the chart, as well as the R2 value.   Choose a linear trendline, not a polynomial or moving average. Displaying the equation on the chart, as well as the R2 value, will depend on what version of Excel you have. Newer versions will let you graph the equation and the R2 value by clicking on the Chart Quick Layouts and finding the equation R2 value layout. In older versions of Excel, navigate to Chart → Add Trendline → Options. Then check both boxes next to "Display equation on chart" and "Display R2 value on chart," respectively.  Your trendline equation will be written in the form of y = βx + a. The coefficient of the x value is your beta.   The R2 value is the relationship of variance of the stock returns to the variance of the overall market returns. A large number, .869 for example, indicates a highly related variance between the two. A low number, .253 for example, indicates a less- related variance between the two. , Beta is the risk, relative to the stock market as a whole, an investor assumes by owning a particular stock. That's why you need to compare the returns of a single stock against the returns of an index. The index is the benchmark against which the stock is judged. The risk of an index is fixed at 1. A beta of lower than 1 means that the stock is less risky than the index to which it's being compared. A beta of higher than 1 means the stock is more risky than the index to which it's being compared.   Take this example: Say that the beta of Gino's Germ Exterminator is calculated at .5. Compared to the S&P 500, the benchmark to which Gino's is being compared, it's half as risky. If the S&P moves down 10%, Gino's stock price will tend to fall only 5%. As another example, imagine that Frank's Funeral Service has a beta of 1.5 when compared to the S&P. If the S&P falls 10%, expect Frank's stock price to fall more than the S&P, or about 15%.  High risk, high reward; low risk, low reward. A stock with a low beta won't lose as much as the S&P when it falls, but it won't gain as much as the S&P when it posts gains. On the other hand, a stock with a beta over 1 will lose more than the S&P when it falls but will also gain more than the S&P when it posts a gain.   For example, pretend Vermeer's Venom Extraction has a beta of .5. When the stock market jumps 30%, Vermeer's only gains 15%. But when the stock market sheds 30%, Vermeer's drops only 15%.  If you make your beta calculations and find out the stock you're analyzing has a beta of 1, it won't be any more or less risky than the index you used as a benchmark. The market goes up 2%, your stock goes up 2%; the market goes down 8%, your stock goes down 8%.  A good mix of high- and low-beta stocks will help you weather any dramatic downturns that the market happens to take. Of course, because low-beta stocks generally underperform the stock market as a whole during a bull market, a good mix of betas will also mean you won't experience the highest of the highs when times are good.  Beta merely measures the past volatility of a stock. We may want to project that volatility into the future, but that won't always work. A stock's beta can change drastically from one year to the next. That's why it's not a terribly reliable predictive tool.	Find the risk-free rate. Determine the respective rates of return for the stock and for the market or appropriate index. Subtract the risk-free rate from the stock's rate of return. Subtract the risk-free rate from the market (or index) rate of return. Divide the first difference above by the second difference above. Find the risk-free rate. Determine the rate of return for the market or its representative index. Multiply the beta value by the difference between the market rate of return and the risk-free rate. Add the result to the risk-free rate. Make three price columns in Excel. Enter your data points into the spreadsheet. Create two return columns to the right of your price columns. Begin calculating returns for the stock market index. Use the copy function to repeat this process for all the data points in your index-price column. Repeat this same process for calculating returns, this time for the individual stock instead of the index. Plot the data in a chart. Add a trendline to your scatter chart. Find the coefficient for the "x" value in the equation of the trendline. Know how to interpret beta. Know that risk is usually related to return. Expect that a stock with a beta of 1 will move in lockstep with the market. Put both high- and low-beta stocks in your portfolio for adequate diversification. Understand that, like most financial prediction tools, beta cannot reliably predict the future.

Aperture refers to the diameter of the lenses. The larger the aperture, the more light the binoculars gather and the better you will be able to see faint objects. Magnification refers to how large the image appears and is limited by the aperture size. Be wary of binoculars that are advertised by magnification only. High magnification with a small aperture is nothing but bad marketing.   (Magnification)x(Aperture in millimeters) is how aperture and magnification are represented. For example, binoculars that are 15 x 70 have an aperture of 70 mm and magnify the image by 15 times. These are a great starting pair for astronomy binoculars.; , Binoculars with large apertures are quite heavy. 20 x 80 binoculars may weigh over 5 pounds! While larger may seem better, if they are too large to use, they are no good.  The price of binoculars does not increase proportionally to size. Larger binoculars become expensive quickly. You can get a good pair of beginner's binoculars for around 60-70 USD.  With heavy binoculars with high magnification, the image will move around a lot if they are hand held. Binoculars can be mounted to a monopod or a tripod. This will steady the image. A monopod is nice because they are extremely portable, steady the image a bit and give your arms a break. If you want to use a mono- or tripod, make sure the binoculars have a sturdy attachment point.	Consider Aperture and magnification: the two most important qualities of binocular selection. Consider the weight. Consider the cost. Consider a monopod or tripod.
The business letter will be a representation of your company. So it should look distinct and high quality. It should also bear your company’s logo or brand.You can create a letterhead using predesigned color letterhead templates in Microsoft word. Be sure to use your existing logo or brand in the letterhead.  You should always type up a business letter on a computer.   Create a new document and set up 1 inch margins for the document.Use a serif font such as Times New Roman, Georgia or Ariel. Be sure to use a font size that is no larger than 12 points, but no smaller than 10 points. The letter should not be difficult to read because of font choice or font size. Make sure the document is set to single spaced.  The block form is the most common format used for business letters. It is also the easiest to setup and follow. Each heading must be left aligned and there should be one space between each heading. Beginning from the top the bottom of the document, your business letter should have the following headings:Today’s date, or the date you are sending the letter. The date is important as it can be used for your records and the receiver’s records. As well, it may have legal use. So make sure it is accurate. The sender’s address. This is your address, formatted in the standard address style. If your address already appears in your letterhead, you can skip this heading. The inside address. This is the name and address of the person you are writing to. The use of Mr/Mrs is optional. So, for example, if you were writing to Nina Brown, you can leave the Ms/Miss off of her name if you are not sure what her marital status is. The salutation. This could be “Dear Ms Brown” or “Dear Nina Brown”. If you are not sure who is going to be reading the letter, use “Dear Sir, or Dear Madam”.You can also use “To Whom It May Concern”, but only as a last resort if you have no idea who your audience is. The body of the letter. We will focus more on this in the next section of the article. The closing of the letter, with a signature. This could be “Sincerely”, or “Kind Regards”.  The tone of the letter should always remain professional, regardless of the audience. But you will likely adjust your language or word choice based on who you are writing to. If you are writing to the human resources department at another business, you may need to use more formal language. But if you are writing to a specific customer, you may use more informal or casual language.Identifying your audience also means you will avoid confusing your audience. Avoid using terminology your reader won't understand. A customer likely won't know the acronyms used for the space program at your company, for example, so avoid using them in the letter. The number one rule of writing a good business letter is to be clear, concise, and courteous.  Consider the purpose of the letter. Is it to let your customers know about your new location in a new part of town? Is it to remind a customer about an unpaid bill or outstanding balance? Or respond to a customer complaint? With this purpose in mind, craft a first line that lets the reader know right away what the letter will be about. Don’t be vague about the purpose of the letter. Cut to the chase.   Start by using “I” if you are stating your opinion as a business owner. Use “we” if you are writing on behalf of a company or organization.Focus on a direct statement such as: “We are writing to inform you” or “We are writing to request”. You can also use an “I” statement if you are writing as the owner of the business. Such as: “I am contacting you because” or “I recently heard about...and would like to know more about…” For example, you (the business owner) are writing Nina Brown about an unpaid bill from last month. Begin the letter with: “I am contacting you because you have an outstanding balance on your account from March 2015.” Or, you are an employee at a company and are writing in response to a customer complaint against the company’s space program. Begin the letter with: “We received your complaint about our Mars space program.” You may be writing to inform the reader they won a contest, or they received a spot in a graduate program. Begin with a phrase like: “I am delighted to inform you…” Or “We are excited to inform you…”. If you’re delivering bad news, begin with a phrase like: “We regret to inform you…”. Or, “After careful consideration, I have decided not to…”., We use the passive voice all the time in common speech. But the passive voice can make your writing seem dull or confusing. The active voice is much more effective in a business letter because it establishes a more assertive tone.An example of the passive voice might be: “What specific complaints can I address for you?” The subject of the sentence, the customer ("you"), appears at the end of the sentence, rather than at the beginning of the sentence. An example of the active voice might be: “What can I do to address your complaints?” This version of the phrase, in the active voice, is much clearer and easier to understand for the reader. The use of the passive voice can be a good way to get your message across without calling attention to an error or an unflattering point. But use it only in this instance. In general, the active voice is much more effective in business letters., Maybe you contacted Nina Brown earlier last month with a warning about her unpaid bill. Or perhaps a customer expressed their frustration with the space program last month at a conference. If you have already been in touch with the reader, acknowledge this. It will remind the reader of your previous contact and make the business letter feel more immediate and important.Use a phrase like: “Per my previous letter about your unpaid bill…” or “Thank you for your payment in March." Or “It was very useful to hear about your issues with the space program at the conference in May.”  , Establish a positive tone with the reader by making a polite request or offering help in the form of a working relationship.Say you are a business owner trying to get a customer to pay a bill.
