Television advertisements can also be rather targeted by placing your ads during shows that the watchers would fit your targeted demographics. As an example, if you are advertising a product to a child or household with children, placing your ad between cartoon shows would allow you to reach your desired audience. You also have the advantage of running ads locally. A commercial will want to be creative and eyecatching. It is important to always include a phone number, website address if available, and address during the entire commercial. A big advantage with a TV commercial is that you are able to hit a large audience in a very short amount of time.; , Billboards seem to work well for local businesses working to capture people driving through an area. It is common for restaurants to advertise off highways to get customers off the road and into their establishment. A great advantage to billboard advertising is the cost is rather inexpensive. It is also more likely that a person would pass that billboard multiple times and see the advertisement multiple times, thus they would remember it better than an ad they saw only once in any other advertising form.  Radio advertising is similar to television advertising only not giving a visual perspective. Radio advertising does give you the advantage of targeting your message to a specific group of listeners. You can target your advertisement to country listeners, rock, etc. Another advantage is that in a radio ad the message is coming directly from the person’s mouth.  Online marketing is becoming more and more popular. People are constantly using their computers and smart phones online. There are also many forms of online marketing. There are online directories, search engines, and social media sites. The popularity of online marketing will continue to grow in popularity. A great advantage to online marketing is that it is readily available for anyone searching for your product. It also allows customers to leave reviews for other potential customers to read.  A direct marketing list is a great option to when it comes to growing your business. This form of marketing allows you to target your message to people that will have an interest in your product or service. There are several marketing lists available including consumer mailing lists, business lists, residential lists and specialty databases. Whether you are using direct mail, telemarketing and/or email marketing, it is important to have a call to action in your mail piece with a deadline. This helps to motivate your audience to act fast. You can purchase any direct mailing lists from a list broker or compiler.	Advertise your service in television commercials. Promote your service on billboards. Promote your service in a radio spot. Promote your business service on the internet. Mail flyers about your business service to a targeted audience.
This is the easiest, most straightforward way to deter a potential trespasser. Some people assume that a property without signs is an abandoned property with an owner unconcerned about trespassing. Brightly colored “No Trespassing” signs posted at various points around the property will make your wishes clear.Place your signs all around the property’s perimeter and at every point of entry and exit.; , Boarding up windows helps to keep out trespassers, but it also helps to protect a vacant building from weather-related damage. When compared with the cost of repairing the damage trespassers can do to a vacant property, plywood is a cheap investment.Use plywood of ¼ thickness or greater, and always screw the plywood to the windowsills instead of nailing it.  Breaking a door lock is time-consuming and loud. In occupied properties, the noise from breaking in can attract unwanted attention from the occupants and passersby. However, in an abandoned building, there are no occupants to alert and passersby might be rarer. Therefore, add an extra layer of security and padlock every door.   There is no such thing as a thief-proof lock, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t important differences between locks. Disc-style padlocks, brass bottomed padlocks, and padlocks made with boron are very difficult to get through with bolt-cutters alone., Although burglar bars aren’t the most attractive feature, they’re a difficult obstacle for a would-be trespasser to circumvent.   Burglar bars cost roughly $150 per window installed. Burglar bars can be purchased and self-installed for about 25% of the cost.Burglar bars on the interior are usually more secure than bars on the exterior, although they’re both good. Install bars on any window less than ten feet off the ground. Storm doors are significantly more expensive, and much more difficult to self-install. Expect to pay at least $250 per door.  Temporary chain-link fencing is widely available for rent and purchase, and the presence of a fence creates one more obstacle to deter a trespasser.   The biggest drawback to putting up a fence is price—the cost of renting a six foot high fence is about $2 per linear foot for the first month and $1 per linear foot for additional months. Purchasing 60 feet of the same can easily cost more than $1,000.	Place “No Trespassing” signs around the property. Board up windows. Padlock all doors. Install burglar bars and security doors over windows and doors. Put up a fence.
Fill a bowl or basin with 1 quart of warm water. Add 1/2 teaspoon of dishwashing detergent and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the water. Mix until well combined.This method may be best for larger stains, as you will soak the entire garment.  Submerge the linen into the solution. Let it soak for approximately 30 minutes. This will allow time for the chemicals to react with the stain. You may want to gently stir the solution from time to time., Take the linen out of the soaking solution and rinse it with cold water. Pay special attention to stained part of the garment. Don’t use hot water, as it can permanently set the stain.  Squeeze out excess moisture without wringing the fabric. Squeezing the liquid out instead of twisting it will help keep the shape of the garment intact. Set it out to dry on a flat surface or hang it on a clothesline.  If traces of the stain remain, repeat the process by mixing up a fresh soaking solution. You may also want to try another method, such as rubbing alcohol, if the stain is particularly stubborn.	Create a cleaning solution. Soak the garment. Remove and rinse. Air-dry the linen. Repeat the process if needed.
Check for exposed pipes in the ceilings. Lofts that once served as warehouses or industrial spaces often have this type of suspension possibilities. Purchase tracking if it is not already in your ceiling. You can buy ripplefold tracking, which brings a curve to your partitions at upholstery or furniture stores. You can find less expensive tracking options, such as canvas stretchers at art supply or hardware stores. Set up the partitions so they are functional and attractive. You may need to experiment with spacing to get the look and feel you want in your loft.; , For example, create a living room area by placing two sofas or loveseats in an "L" shape.   Use large furniture pieces, such as armoires and sectionals to separate living space from sleeping space. Float your furniture instead of backing it up against walls. This will allow all sides of the furniture to be seen, and it makes a loft space seem less wide open and more organized and contained.  Pay attention to what belongs. In order to break off a kitchen space, for example, do not keep the dishes near the bed.	Look for tracking in the ceilings to hold drapes, panels or other materials that can create space partitions. Place furniture appropriately to create different areas in your loft. Contain each space.
; ,,, The answers to the questions must be either "Yes" or "No," and a forfeit must be paid if any other answer is given. Suppose the object chosen is a piece of coal in the fireplace. The player will begin by finding out whether the object chosen is of the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom; thus the following questions may be asked: "Is it a mineral?" "Yes." "Is it hard?" "Yes." "Is it very valuable?" "No." "Is it bright and shiny?" "No." "Is it gold?" "No." "Silver?" "No." "Is it in this room?" "Yes." "Is it black?" "Yes." "Is it a piece of coal?" "Yes."  ,,	Send one player out of the room. While he is gone, decide upon some object which he is to guess.  , Call the player back in.  , If you are the player, you should begin asking questions. The correct object being guessed, another player is sent out and the game continues.  , For future use, this website is in fact a mineral.
Caulk is found between bathroom tiles and may also run along the walls of a bathroom. It can contribute to bathroom odor. Over time, caulk becomes porous and absorbs odors. If your bathroom smell does not respond to routine cleaning, remove old caulk with an X-acto knife. Replace it with fresh caulk. You can buy bathroom caulk at a local hardware store., Sometimes, small changes can make a big impact on bathroom smells. Remember to close the lid after using the bathroom. This can prevent unpleasant odors from leaking into the air., If you have a wastebasket in your bathroom, take it out at least once a week. Any trash that's left sitting out can build up odors over time, resulting in a foul smell. Regular trash removal can be very effective in combating bathroom odors., As bathrooms are frequently damp environments, towels can get musty fast. If you keep hand towels in your bathroom, launder them at least once a week. This can prevent a buildup of odors that leads to an unpleasant smell.To help remove odors, try adding a half cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle when doing laundry.Make sure you dry towels completely before putting them back in the bathroom., If you clean your bathroom carefully, but still have problems with mold or odor, it may be time for a major renovation. Consider switching to odor or moisture resistant surfaces for your tub, bathroom tiles, sinks, and so on. This may be costly, but if it's within your budget and odor is a real problem, it may be worth the money.	Re-caulk your tiles. Close the lid after flushing. Take out the trash regularly. Launder bathroom fabrics. Consider switching to odor or moisture resistant surfaces.
Even if you're not personally guaranteeing the loan, the financial institution that processes your loan will be checking your personal credit report. Get a copy of it before you complete any loan applications so you know your score.You are legally entitled to one free credit report every 12 months. You can request your free report by visiting annualcreditreport.com or calling 1-877-322-8228. This website is the only one approved by the federal government – beware of other sites claiming to give you a free credit report but that ask for credit card or other information. In addition to checking your score, you also should review all entries in your report. If you see something that is inaccurate, you can contact the reporting company that issued the report and dispute it. Before you apply for a business loan, you want to know what's on your credit report and be able to explain any negative marks.; , Most traditional financial institutions want to look at your personal tax returns for at least the past three years in connection with a business loan application. You should have them in your financial records, but you may want to make copies to prepare for the application process.If you don't have the tax returns you need in your personal records, you can download transcripts of your past tax returns by visiting irs.gov. The IRS offers transcripts for the current year and the past three years free of charge. You also can order them by phone by calling 800-908-9946 and following the automated prompts. A transcript shows most line items on your tax return, including your adjusted gross income and taxable income, along with any additional forms you filed with your return. The transcript should be sufficient for financial institutions processing a business loan application, but keep in mind that if you need copies of your full returns you will have to pay a $57 fee for each return you request from the IRS.  While not all loan programs require a signed personal financial statement, many want this document from you and anyone else who owns at least a 20 percent stake in your business.The Small Business Association (SBA) has a form you can use to create your personal financial statement. The form is available for download from the SBA website. The SBA's form is approved for use in evaluating credit worthiness for SBA-guaranteed loans, but you can use the form as a guide to create your personal financial statement even if you're applying for a loan that isn't guaranteed by the SBA. Your personal financial statement must include information about all of your personal assets and liabilities, as well as your income from all sources.  In addition to your personal financial statement, you should make copies of your bank statements for at least a year. Include all of your major accounts, such as your personal checking and savings accounts.Typically your bank can get the last year's worth of monthly statements for you if you stop by a branch. If you have an online account with your bank, you also may be able to pull up the statements you need and download or print them at home.  Since your ability to pay off a business loan will depend on how well your business does, many financial institutions want to review your resumé to understand your experience and educational background.Keep in mind that while most resumés are geared toward getting a job, this resumé will be used to get a loan for your small business, so you should adjust your basic resumé accordingly. Instead of the traditional "objective" section seen on most resumés, provide a brief introduction of yourself and explain why you need the loan and believe your application should be approved. Highlight your skills and expertise in the industry in which your business operates, as well as any business education and managerial experience. Include a detailed work history with a list of your responsibilities at every job you've held going back several years. Make sure the document is formatted cleanly and carefully proofread. Your goal should be to present a skillfully crafted professional resumé that works to sell both you and your business to the lender.  If your business has been in operation for any length of time, it will have its own credit report under its employer identification number (EIN). Since you're applying for a business loan, the financial institution will review that credit report in addition to the personal credit reports of business owners.A business credit report works differently than a personal credit report, and the information is submitted voluntarily. For this reason, your business may not have much of a credit report despite the fact that it has years of credit history. Business credit reports are issued by Experian Business, Equifax Business, Dun & Bradstreet, and Business Credit USA. To get business credit reports, you must contact each of those companies individually. Expect to be charged a fee to gain access to your business credit report.  Most financial institutions want copies of bank statements for your business bank accounts for the past year, or for as long as your business has been in operation.Keep in mind that if your business has only been open for a little over a year, the lending institution may want bank records going all the way back to the inception of the account. You typically can access the monthly statements the same way you would statements for a personal bank account – visit your local branch or pull them from online. The lending institution will primarily be interested in your business's cash flow – whether you're paying out more than you're bringing in and the extent to which that is true.  If you have business assets you can offer as collateral for the loan, it's a good idea to go ahead and have those assets appraised and draw up a document listing the collateral you can offer for the loan.Your collateral document doesn't have to list all assets – just those you're willing to put up against the loan. Collateral may include personal assets as well as business assets, but be careful when putting up significant personal assets such as your family home. if your business fails, you could end up losing your house. Your collateral document should include proof that you own the assets and that they're currently unencumbered. If you already have loans or mortgages against the property you want to use as collateral, only the amount of equity you have in that property will count.  If your business hasn't been in operation for very long, you may not have the three years of business tax returns financial institutions commonly ask for. But you still typically must provide copies of any tax returns you've filed for the lifetime of your business.If you have your tax returns in your business files, this is simply a matter of copying the tax returns for the requested years. However, you'll have to go through some additional steps if you don't have tax returns in your files. You can request transcripts from the IRS free of charge for the current year and the previous three years. The transcript includes most of the information on the return and as such, should be sufficient for financial institutions processing a loan application. While you can request personal tax return transcripts online, if you want transcripts of business tax returns you must complete IRS Form 4056T and fax or mail it to the appropriate IRS address. Keep in mind that you may have to wait as long as 30 days to receive your transcripts if you request them by mail, so if you don't have your business tax returns on file, you should request your transcripts well in advance of the time you plan to apply for a business loan.  Particularly if your business is still in the start-up phase, financial institutions require a sound business plan complete with profit and loss calculations and financial projections for the next several years.A full business plan also must include a market analysis of your competition and prospects for growth along with a description of the particular advantages your business has over competitors and your market strategy. Include profiles of yourself and all partners in your business, including areas of expertise, experience, and other skills each of you bring to the table. Describe the specific areas of which each person involved in the business will be in charge along with details about your business operations and structure. Financial information that should be contained in your business plan includes projections, a profit and loss statement, and cash flow and balance sheets. If you haven't already created a business plan, or if your plan is over a year old, you may need to create a new one for the purposes of applying for a business loan. Seek the assistance of a business consultant, business attorney, or business accountant if you have questions or difficulties producing any of the reports that should be included in your business plan.  When you apply for a business loan, the financial institution will need to personally verify your identification and conduct personal background checks, so you may need copies of any related legal documents.Since the lending institution typically will run criminal background checks on you and any partners in your business, you'll need documents that pertain to any marks you might have on your criminal record. You also want to have documents handy that explain any name changes or other identity information. For example, if you changed your name after a divorce, you may want a copy of the divorce decree just in case your use of a different name is questioned. Typically it's a better idea to present documents to support or explain something in your record before the lending institution finds it, rather than just waiting to see if they mention something or request an explanation.  You won't be able to get a business loan unless you can prove that your business is legally allowed to operate in your location, so the financial institution will want copies of all required business licenses.In most cities and states you must have a license to operate your business, as well as documentation that you have registered to pay state business or sales taxes. Some types of businesses require other licenses. For example, if you own a restaurant that sells alcohol, you typically need a liquor license. Be prepared to provide copies of these licenses along with documentation to prove your license is in good standing with the issuing authorities.  If your business is organized as a partnership, LLC, or corporation, the financial institution typically will want to review your partnership agreement or articles of incorporation.If you are operating your business as a sole proprietorship, you may not have any of these types of documents. However, you should be prepared to provide copies of any registrations you've made with your state's secretary of state, such as if you've registered a DBA in connection with your business. Businesses organized as an LLC or corporation typically must provide all organizing documents as well as certificates from the state in which your business was organized.  As part of your business's overall financial picture, these documents prove either the business's liabilities or the business's potential future income.For example, if you have a standing contract with a vendor under which you pay a set amount per month for inventory-related products or services, this contract proves your business's liability to that vendor. Likewise, long-term contracts with clients in which your business has a set amount of income coming in on a regular basis should be provided, and the amounts included in your financial planning documents.	Check your credit report. Copy past tax returns. Draft a personal financial statement. Request personal bank statements. Brush off your resumé. Review your business credit report. Collect business bank statements. Prepare a collateral document. Copy business tax returns. Include a detailed business plan. Copy personal legal documents. Gather all licenses and registrations. Get certified copies of organization documents. Organize any long-term leases, contracts, or agreements.
Start with government agencies to identify any possibilities of obtaining government loans, since these often provide lending at very competitive rates. Also look to the private sector, especially organizations that are focused on offering support services to farmers of all types.; , Base your initial qualification of those lenders on information that is available online and through other media outlets. This will help to limit your list to lenders who have a history of approving secured crop loans in the amount you have in mind.  As the next phase of the task, delve into more specific information about each lender on your list. Look into the financial stability of the lender, as well as locating and reading consumer reports about how each lender interacts with its customers. This will give you some idea of which lenders have a reputation for honesty and integrity. Remove those who do not seem to be up to your personal standards.  Establish contact and obtain specific information on the qualifications that you must meet in order to submit an application and successfully receive a secured loan on crops. Keep in mind that while some lenders will accept just about any type of crop that has market value, others may be focused on approving loans secured with specific crops.  After evaluating the reputation and financial stability of each lender, along with policies and procedures used to consider applications, determine which lender is the most likely to provide the secured crop loan you need.  Many lenders will want to see histories of the past performance of the crops you plan on using as collateral for the loan, as well as the usual information on your assets, current liabilities, and other relevant financial information. In some cases, this may require up to 5 years of data. Include information such as sale prices and total sales volume related to the growing season from 1 year to the next. Make sure to include data about any extenuating circumstances that may have negatively impacted crop production in any one of those years.  Use the channels provided by your lender of choice, noting any information about the duration of the application processing.	Investigate the range of lenders who provide secured loans on crops. Compile a list of viable lenders. Get the background on each of those lenders. Approach the remaining lenders. Narrow your attention to the lender who seems to be the best fit for your situation. Prepare your support documentation. Submit the application and supporting documents.
Your surface must be clear of debris before you begin to weld.   To prepare carbon steel, use a grinder or sander and polish it down to a bare, shiny metal. For aluminum, it is best to use a dedicated stainless steel wire brush. For stainless steel, just wipe down the weld area with some solvent on a rag. Make sure to store the rag and chemicals in a safe place before welding.  Unscrew the back of the electrode holder on the collet, insert the tungsten electrode, and screw the back on again. Generally, the electrode should hang about 1/4-inch away from the protective sheath on the collet.  Use an angle iron and/or a flat bar with c-clamps to secure the parts you want to weld together.  A tack weld is a very small weld that is intended to hold a part in place until the final weld can be completed. Place tack welds every few inches where your two metals meet.  Be sure to hold it at about a 75 degree angle with the tungsten raised no more than 1/4-inch off the metal.   Don't let the tungsten touch the work piece or it will contaminate your material.  Your weld puddle should be about 1/4-inch wide. It is important to keep your puddle size consistent throughout the weld to avoid a messy finish.  Hold it so it rests horizontally at a 15 degree angle from the work piece at the base where the torch will heat the piece.  The heat of the arc will create a puddle, a pool of molten metal that is used to fuse the two pieces of metal together.   Once there is a puddle on both pieces of metal, tap the filler rod into the molten puddle in quick dabs to avoid clumping. The filler rod adds a reinforcement layer for your weld.  Unlike MIG welding, where you lead the puddle in the direction that the torch is leading, with TIG welding you push the puddle the opposite direction that the torch leans.   Think of your hand motion as that of a left-handed person operating a pencil. While a right-handed person moves their pencil like a MIG weld, with the angles both tilted to the right, a left-handed person has their pencil tilted to the left, though they must push the pencil to the right. Continue to advance the puddle until you have welded the entire area desired and you've completed a TIG weld!	Clean your welding material. Insert the tungsten electrode into its collet. Clamp the parts together. Tack weld the parts together. Hold the TIG torch in your hand. Practice using the foot pedals to control the heat. Pick up the filler rod in your other hand. Use your torch to heat up the base metal. Advance the puddle in the desired direction using your arc.

Most service businesses have a clear set of rules for their workers. However, there's almost always a second, more flexible set of “rules” that govern the lengths to which you can bend or break the posted rules in order to keep a customer satisfied. Knowing these will help you go above and beyond the call of duty (which more often than not, calms customers down regardless of the eventual outcome) without getting in trouble.   Most often, only management is allowed to make these exceptions, but ask and learn all you can to find any customer situation where you're also allowed to bend the rules. Sometimes, mollifying an irate customer is just a matter of showing them you'll make an exception in their case. Learn how to do it safely.  Sometimes, customers drop all pretense of politeness and say something rude or mean. Nine times out of ten, if you let it slide without even acknowledging that it was said, the customer will immediately feel guilty about crossing that line and become much more peaceful for the rest of the conversation.   If you can directly respond to an insult as though you didn't even realize it was meant as an insult, that's even better. The customer will be on his or her best behavior for the rest of the transaction in most cases, because he or she has been given a free do-over on a needless insult and would like you to not figure out what the original intent of it was.  This doesn't mean being passive-aggressive; it means responding to irate customers the same way you'd respond to your favorite customers. Many customers who heckle you are only trying to get a rise out of you so they have even more to complain about. Don't give them the satisfaction. Just keep providing service with a smile and a can-do attitude, at least until the customer crosses the line and begins to actually abuse you verbally. (At that point, more drastic measures may be required.)   It's perfectly fine to gripe about customers, but do it well away from where other customers can hear you, and do it after they've left. If you don't have a good place to commiserate with your coworkers about a bad customer, you're better off just keeping it to yourself and venting at home.  When there's a recurring problem customer, it's up to your store's management team to set a policy for dealing with him or her. Let them know there's a customer who's become a real problem for you and your fellow workers, and ask for advice on what to do about it. In some cases, the problem customer will be removed from the store; in many, the manager will assume the responsibility of catering to the customer.  “The customer is always right” is a guideline for service, not a decree allowing customers to walk all over you. Doing everything you can reasonably do to make your customers happy is very different from enduring humiliation and abuse in the name of your job. While it's important to have a thick skin and not let most things upset you, once in a while, a customer will blatantly cross the line. At such times, you have the right to calmly ask them to stop, and explain how it makes you feel.   Sadly, your freedom to put the kibosh on customer abuse varies somewhat from company to company. However, generally speaking, you're allowed to draw the line at being personally attacked, shamed or ridiculed in front of an audience, or physically assaulted. If the customer still won't stop attacking you, get help from your fellow employees. You always have the right to handle the customer with the assistance of a manager or coworker who's willing to assume the burden.  Very, very rarely, a customer may decide to spend his or her day ruining your day for no good reason, and you'll find yourself without a manager or helpful coworker in sight. At these times, you need to look out for yourself first. Don't tempt the customer to lash out at you by showing your emotions, but don't stand for abuse, either. Tell the customer to wait while you get a manager; if they don't want a manager, tell them there's nothing more you can do for them, and that they need to leave. Look them in the eye and don't back down from what you're saying.   Again, staying calm and collected is the most important thing in this situation. Don't raise your voice or say anything rude, and don't sob or cry. Don't even let yourself smile or frown. Any sign of uncontrolled emotion will either make the customer even angrier, or spur them to continue abusing you. Don't ask them to leave, tell them they need to leave. You can explain yourself, but don't waver. If you're suffering an extraordinary amount of customer abuse and there's nobody around to help you deal with it, it's better to get written up than it is to let your spirit be crushed. A decent employer won't fire you for acting in your own best interests in such an extreme situation.	Learn more than just the rules. Skip a beat. Kill them with kindness. Talk to management. Know your limits. Stand your ground.
This will most commonly be a ring or horizontal bar. Though macramé is designed to stay on its anchor permanently, it’s a good idea to practice with a pencil.          You could avoid an anchor entirely and tape your cord to a flat surface -- just make sure the tape keeps your cord anchored and parallel to your surface. If you're making a necklace or bracelet, use a connector or charm as your anchor! If it can be threaded through, it'll work!; , Place a loop of cord over your anchor and bend it over. This is a standard way to start any macramé project.          If you walk into any craft supply store, there will be a section dedicated to macramé cords. These are great materials, but the art of macramé lies in the knotting. You can use rope if you please.  The reverse larkshead knot is simply pulled from the other side.  That's the larkshead knot! That's the basic start of any project, with a few variations that are also standard:          Most projects use at least four cords. If this is the case, use either two larkshead knots next to each other or a larkshead knot inside another larkshead knot.  For two larkshead knots next to each other, the color pattern will be, for example, red-red-blue-blue. The center red-blue cords will be your anchor cords; red will be what you're working with on the left and blue will be what you're working with on the right. Therefore, with this method, the colors are different. For the larkshead knot that inside the larger larkshead knot, the color pattern will be red-blue-blue-red. The blue cords will be your anchor cords; reds will be what you're working with on all knots. Therefore, with this method, the colors are the same.	Find an object to use as an anchor. Begin tying your larkshead knot. Pull the length of the cords through the loop. Pull gently to snug the knot down.
Spread the word. Stress what you have in common with those you speak to. You will be especially effective if your questions direct their answers toward your conclusions. Make sure they know that anarchism is not about chaos or smashing things, it is a political and social ideology that advocates self-organization and a non-hierarchical political and economic system rooted in Direct Democracy, Radical Democracy, or individualism depending on the type of anarchism.  Accusations of utopianism with examples of anarchy in action, most indigenous societies throughout history have been anarchist and even today there are many intentional communities that operate along anarchist lines - not always in the places you'd expect. The Amish, for instance, are a great example of non-ideological Anarchism in action., But remember, protest changes nothing if there is no movement behind it. That means long hours of community organizing, sitting through meetings, working with people who you probably disagree with and may not even like. It's not easy but if you really want to spread your message, it is necessary.   You will probably have to make a lot of cold calls, put up flyers, and set up booths at local events in order to gain people's attention. If you truly believe in spreading your philosophy, these are all necessary actions.  Lead by example. There are a lot of local events led by anarchist groups around the world. They range from informal meet and greets to book fairs and concerts.  There are some anarchists who disagree with the use of social media as it tends to support big social media corporations.In our social media age, you can find other people with similar interests easily. Search your social media platforms (Facebook, Reddit, 4chan, 8chan, YouTube, Google+, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Vine, Steam....etc.) for other like minded individuals. You can also help organize protests and other anarchist activities through social media. This is a great way to get free exposure for your movement.	Learn to be persuasive. Prepare to respond to accusations. Participate in protests, direct action, and grass-roots organizations. Organize anarchist events/meetings. Use social media to spread the word.
Start locally, then expand the list to regional and even national media. Include newspapers, television programs, websites and radio stations. Keep an updated list with personal contact information for each entry.; , For example, if your non-profit is a domestic violence shelter, contact the reporter who most likely to cover crime or domestic violence issues.  The cost of doing so will be more than offset by any free publicity you garner.  Do not pester a reporter to cover every meeting held by your non-profit. Story ideas must pertain to a relevant and timely issue in order to get any notice. It's important to have a human interest angle in mind.   If a reporter turns down your story pitch, don't take it personally. It may not work into the reporter's schedule, or she may not find the idea relevant at the time. Don't give up and remain on friendly terms with the person.  Don't be afraid to give out your cell phone number. If a reporter cannot reach you with one phone call, he most likely will move on to an alternative source for his story.  If you make her miss her deadline or feed her with lousy information, he will not call back the next time he needs help.  When a reporter asks a question, she wants an immediate answer.   If there's no way you can answer immediately, ask the reporter when her deadline is. Be sure to get back to her as soon as possible.  Press kits and releases are not as effective as making a call to a reporter, but they are a good way to send background information on your agency. Include your business card so reporters can keep your contact information on file.  Reporters rarely receive praise.	Make a database of key media outlets in your area. Introduce yourself to local reporters who cover your beat. Give reporters who cover your beat a free copy of any publications you sell and a free ticket to any events you organize. Pitch story ideas as they come up. Make time for reporters and be accessible. Be accurate and trustworthy when a reporter comes to you for a quote. Think on your feet because a reporter isn't going to wait for a canned response from you hours later. Send press kits or releases to a specific contact at a news organization. Thank reporters when you are satisfied with the stories they write.

If you're considering opening a day care, you probably already know that you love working with kids. Take these other elements of running a day care into account before you make the decision to devote yourself to starting a new business:   Are you ready to handle the mishaps, behavioral issues and emergencies that arise when working with kids?

Day care centers are operated from commercial spaces. They can accommodate more children and bring in more revenue, which allows them to hire more employees.  To legally operate a day care, it's necessary to obtain a license, which must be renewed each year.   Licensing requirements are different for home day cares and day care centers. Research the requirements in your area for the type of day care you wish to operate. To obtain a license you will undergo a home or facility safety inspection and prove that your operation is following the laws of your state. You must demonstrate that your operation has a certain ration of adult caretakers to children. The requirements vary with the age of the children. You may have to complete an orientation or course on managing a day care. You are required to file all the necessary paperwork and submit a fee to complete the licensing process.  Before you settle on running a home day care, make sure you have enough space for children you wish to serve. Is the bathroom located close to the intended play area? Is there a fenced-in outdoor yard? A commercial space should also be large enough to accommodate the number of kids who will join your day care.

Before you start setting up your game of Monopoly Empire, you may want to check the game components to ensure that you have everything. Checking the game components will also help you to become more familiar with the game pieces and board. You should have:a Monopoly Empire board 4 Towers 6 game tokens 30 Billboard tiles 6 Office tiles 14 Chance cards 14 Empire cards Monopoly money 2 dice; , After you have checked your game components to make sure that you have everything you need to play, you can set up your game board. Unfold the board and place it on a table, the floor, or wherever you plan to play the game.Make sure that you place the board somewhere that all of the players have easy access to the board.  Shuffle the deck of Chance cards and the deck of Empire cards and place them in their designated spots on the board. The Chance cards are similar to the Chance cards used in regular Monopoly. The Empire cards are similar to the Community Chest cards in Monopoly, which often give you advantages that may help you win the game.You will get two Empire cards at the beginning of the game.  The brand billboard tiles have specific places all around the game board. Look for these spaces and match the billboard tile to the billboard space. For example, the Coca-Cola billboard tile should go on the Coca-Cola billboard space. You will be competing against your fellow players to obtain these tiles and fill up your tower first., The Water Works and Electric Company tiles have a specific spaces on the board where you should place those tiles until someone purchases them. There is one space for all four of the Water Works tiles and one space for all four of the Electric Company tiles., The only tiles that you do not place on the board are the six office tiles. Leave these tiles off of the board along with the dice. You can put them off to the side or have someone be in charge of them., The banker is in charge of handling transactions, managing auctions, giving players money when they pass “GO,” and collecting fees and fines. Make sure that the person you choose to be the banker is willing and able to perform all of these tasks.Have the banker give everyone $1000 to start the game (one $500, four $100s, and two $50s).  Everyone starts the game with two Empire cards. Look at them, but don’t share them you’re your fellow players. Wait until your turn to use them. Each player will also need a tower. The object of the game is to be the first one to fill up your tower with billboards., The game tokens in Monopoly Empire include a game controller, racecar, coke bottle, film slate, motorcycle, and French fries. , In Monopoly Empire, the first player to fill up his or her billboard with brand billboards wins the game. Therefore, you want to buy as many brand billboards as quickly as you can to fill up the spaces in your board. When other players land on billboard spaces that you own, they will have to pay you the amount of money you’re your billboard height reaches on your tower.If a player runs out of money, they do not go bankrupt as in regular Monopoly. That player simply takes the top billboard piece from his or her tower and gives it to the player who requires it., Before you start the game, decide who will go first. The official rules for Monopoly Empire state that the youngest player gets to go first. If you prefer, you can also determine who goes first by rolling the dice and seeing who gets the largest number.

Your turn will be a little different every time based on the space you land on. During your turn, perform each of the following actions:Roll the dice. Take two turns if you roll a double. For example, if you roll two sixes, then move 12 spaces and perform an action for that space. But then, roll again and move again and perform another action. Move your token the number of spaces you rolled. For example, if you roll a 10, then move 10 spaces Perform an action for the space you land on. For example, if you land on a billboard tile that is available for purchase, then you can purchase it.  Whenever you land on a Chance or Empire card space, you will get to draw one of these cards. In general, you will need to use Chance cards right away, but you can save Empire cards until you want or need to use them.For example, if you get a “Get Out of Jail Free” card, then you can hang onto it until you need it.  If you happen to land on a billboard that you do not want to buy, then that tile will be up for auction. The banker is in charge of managing the auction and the bidding starts at $50. All follow-up bids must be in increments of $50, such as $100, $150, $200, $250, etc. The highest bidder gets the billboard and must pay the amount that he or she bid to the bank., If you roll the handshake icon on one of your dice rolls, then you can perform a sneaky swap as one of your turn actions. This means that you can exchange two topmost billboard tower tiles. For example, you can exchange your topmost billboard tile with another player’s topmost billboard tile, or you can swap the tiles of two other players.Using the sneaky swap is optional. If you do not want to use it, just move your piece the number of spaces that that you rolled on the other die. If you do use the sneaky swap, then do not move this turn.

There are many successful career women out there - in business and in other fields. Researching and learning about their background and career paths will help to motivate and inspire you. Reading their stories will give an idea of what the path to success looks like and what obstacles you might encounter along the way.   The web is a great resource for researching successful business women. There are some interesting and insightful articles on websites such as Forbes and Harvard Business School. You can also read the memoirs or biographies of a number of successful women and gain an insight into their professional experiences - both good and bad.   Sheryl Sandberg. An excellent example of one such memoir is "Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead" by Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook. She discusses issues such as the low level of women in corporate and governmental leadership roles, the pay inequalities faced by women in the workplace and the difficulty of balancing career ambitions with raising a family. She encourages young, female graduates to "believe in themselves, raise their hands, sit at the table, take risks and support each other."Anne-Marie Slaughter. Anne-Marie Slaughter is a Princeton professor who rose to prominence in 2012 when she wrote an article in The Atlantic titled “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,” a frank assessment of her difficulty balancing her work as director of policy planning at the State Department for Hillary Clinton with her responsibilities as the mother of two sons. In the article, she argued for “changing social policies and bending career tracks to accommodate our choices” rather than expecting women to simply run themselves ragged in order to play by the current rules of the workplace.Hillary Clinton. Former Secretary of State and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has long been an advocate of women's rights. Clinton has emphasized the need to extend family and medical leave and to encourage women and girls to pursue careers in math and science. She says: "We need to empower women here at home to participate fully in our economy and our society. We need to make equal pay a reality." Many will argue that Hillary Clinton is actually not a very good example. This is because not only is she not a business woman, but she is also under the threat of investigation.  ; , No matter what field you're in, there are sure to be successful women who've paved the way for others. Finding out about successful women in your particular field will give you a better idea of what a typical career path might look like and highlight some practical steps you can take to become successful.   Research what schools the women in your field went to, what internships they did, whether they worked abroad, where they got their first job, and any other information regarding their career path. Figure out what these women did right, then use that knowledge to work out a career plan of your own.  Historically, women have been underrepresented in fields such as science, engineering, technology, mathematics and computer science. By pursuing a career in one of these areas, a woman may benefit from certain incentives designed to encourage more women to enter these fields, such as scholarship programs and grants.  Perhaps the greatest concern for women in the workforce is how to balance work and family life. Women are usually in their key childbearing years while simultaneously trying to advance their career and climb the corporate ladder.   Surveys have shown that most women leave their jobs due to caretaking conflicts or workplace climates which are hostile to the demands of parenthood.The best way to ensure a balance between work and family is to find a company which offers a combination of parent-friendly policies such as paid maternity leave, company-sponsored childcare, flexible scheduling, family healthcare benefits and paternity leave.  Despite making fantastic progress in terms of the number of women in the workforce and the proportion of those who go on to reach managerial and executive positions, there is still a long way to go, especially when it comes to equal pay. The frustrating truth is that women earn significantly less than men, for the same work. Although factors such as education or the decision to have a child can affect pay levels, the main problem is that women consistently undervalue themselves and fail to effectively negotiate with employers for higher salaries.In order to overcome pay inequality, you should:   Do your homework. Find out what other people (men and women), with the same qualifications and in similar positions, are earning. Learn how to negotiate. Once you know your value, you should work on selling your qualifications, skills and achievements. Never undersell yourself. Don't offer a salary figure first, and provide a salary range if you are pressed about it. Never say yes to an offer immediately. Think of the first number they provide as an "initial offer" and continue to negotiate if you feel you are being undervalued. Realize that you are entitled to ask for a raise. If you are already in a job where you feel that your contributions are undervalued, or you find out that a colleague is being paid more for the same work, don't be afraid to ask for a raise. Just be sure to build a convincing case: do your homework and find out the salary range for similar roles both within and outside the company. Be prepared to talk about your positive contributions to the company including any recent successes or problems you have solved. Highlight any positive feedback you have received from others on your team. , Having confidence in yourself and your abilities is essential in becoming a successful businesswoman. People will view you as you portray yourself. If you project confidence, people will believe that you are confident.   Self-doubt is natural, but don't let it overwhelm you. Remember that you are where you are because you're good at what you do. Project confidence through your body language. You can do this by standing tall and keeping your head held high. Greet people with a firm handshake and a smile. Most importantly of all, make eye contact with the person you're speaking to. Try not to glance at them before quickly looking away, remember to hold their gaze, as this is a sure sign of confidence. If you have to address a room of people, try to make eye contact with every person in the room for at least a second or two. If you're having a bad day where your confidence feels shaken, try to reassure yourself using positive affirmations. It may feel silly, but looking at yourself in the mirror and repeating something like "I am great at what I do" or "I am determined to reach the top" can really help you to rediscover your confidence and determination.  One of the most enduring stereotypes about women in business is that they are weak and emotional. The best way to overcome these stereotypes is to disprove them. In order to gain respect as a formidable businesswoman, it is important to be assertive.   You can convey assertiveness through both your speech and your actions - have confidence in your decisions and don't second-guess yourself. Speak authoritatively, in a clear, confident manner and people will have no reason to doubt your decisions. When faced with criticism, try to be as rational and collected as possible. Consider what has been said and decide whether you can use the criticism constructively or whether you should just disregard it. Whatever you do, don't let it be a trigger which causes you to doubt yourself and your abilities. , The capacity to handle criticism and grow from it is a very important aspect of success. However, there is a big difference between constructive criticism and destructive criticism. You need to learn how to recognize and handle each of them.   Destructive criticism is a comment or accusation designed to hurt your self-esteem. It is not intended to help you or allow you to see what you did wrong and improve on it. An example of destructive criticism would be a coworker saying "How could you be so stupid?" or "What were you thinking?" The best way to deal with this type of criticism is simply to ignore it. Constructive criticism, on the other hand, usually has a good intention behind it. It is intended to help you to improve and should be viewed as a positive. An example of constructive criticism would be: "Thanks for your report. It was a good effort, but I think it could benefit from more statistics to support your findings." The best way to handle this type of criticism is to thank the person for their feedback and to use their comments to improve your work in the future.	Read about successful women. Research women in your field. Consider a field with fewer women in it. Determine how to balance work and family. Overcome pay inequality. Be confident. Be assertive. Handle criticism well.
; , This will form the base of your windmill tower. Use 1" (2.5 cm) diameter PVC pipe cut to the lengths described below, and attach as follows:   Fit three 6" (15 cm) lengths of pipe into the three holes of a T-junction. Tap the pipes together with a hammer so they fit together tightly. Make an identical shape with three more 6" (15 cm) segments and a second T-junction.  This third T-junction needs a new hole so you can snake the wires through that conduct power from your windmill. Follow these steps to drill safely:Secure the T-junction in a vise. Position it so the central branch points downward. Dent the back of the T-junction with a hammer and nail, leading into the central branch. Use the dent as a guide to prevent your drill from slipping. You can use a drill bit designed for wood or metal.  Use the third T-junction you just drilled to connect the two central branches of the T-shapes. Fit these into opposite ends of the T-junction, to form one large "H." Before you make the connection tight, lay the H flat on the floor. Position the T-junction so the empty hole is pointing upward, and the hole you drilled is on the floor.  The "feet" of the windmill are four 90º PVC elbow connectors. Attach one to each of the four ends of the H. The open end of the connector should be flat on the floor, so it supports the H with the central T junction facing straight up.  It's up to you how tall to make your windmill, as long as the blades have room to spin without hitting the base. A 24" (61 cm) length of pipe should work well. Attach this securely in the central T-junction.  This should be as close to 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) in diameter as possible, since it needs to fit snugly inside a PVC coupling. You can buy the motor at an electronics store, or look for a "turbine kit" online. The turbine kit may include a hub, dowels, or other parts you need for this section of the project.The motor should have two attached wires. Before you continue, confirm that the hole you drilled in the T-junction can fit both the wires. If it cannot, expand the hole with a larger drill bit. The driveshaft of this motor will need to fit into a hub (described below). You may want to buy the hub first, then take it to an electronics store to find a motor that fits securely.  Attach a 3" (7.5 cm) length of PVC pipe into a 90º elbow connector. Fit a PVC coupling over the other end of the straight pipe. You've just made the "nacelle," or compartment that will house the rotor.   As before, make all connections tight by tapping them together with a hammer.  Feed the wires attached to the DC motor through the coupling, and pull them out through the elbow connector.  It's important to fit the motor snugly into the mouth of the coupling. To ensure this, wrap the motor with duct tape until it fits tight against the wall of the coupling. Position the motor so the driveshaft end protrudes slightly from the opening. Make it as straight as possible, since an off-centered motor will cause your windmill blades to wobble.  This hub should fit snugly over the driveshaft without pressing against the body of the motor. Most people either use the hub from a "turbine kit," available online, or a spool from a Tinkertoy set, with one central hole.   You can save money (and get an exact fit) by cutting your own hub out of plywood (a circle with angled slits in the edge for attaching the windmill blades).This is fairly difficult at the small size described in this project, at least for novice woodworkers.  Get two extra wires long enough to travel down the vertical pole of the windmill and out through the hole you drilled in the base. Attach them to the two wires on the motor using twist-on connectors.    Splicing the wires together takes more effort, but is more secure.  Have someone hold the top section (nacelle) while you drop the wires down through the vertical pipe of the windmill. Pick up the wires from the base and pull them through the hole in the base.  Fit the elbow connector on the nacelle over the vertical pipe, tapping them together with a hammer. Position it so the hub faces forward, between the two legs of the "H" on the base.  Both the kit and Tinkertoy hubs have holes spaced around the edge of the circle. Insert dowels or Tinkertoy rods into these holes. Each rod will support one blade on the windmill. You can use any number of blades on your windmill, but they must be evenly spaced around the hub. If the blades are unbalanced, the windmill will vibrate as it runs, and parts could break.   Make these rods as secure as possible. If they are loose, they may fly out at high speed while the windmill is spinning. The safest option is a dowel slightly too large for the hole, with one end sanded down until it barely fits. Start with two to four rods, so it's easy to experiment with the design of your blades.You can always add more later if you need more power. Professional wind turbines rarely have more than three blades., Try poster board, or a sturdy paper or Styrofoam plate. If you want stiffer blades (which provide more power), buy thin sheets of balsa wood from a craft or home improvement store.Cut the blades to any shape and size you like, but make sure they are all identical so your windmill is balanced.   The blades will work better if the tip is rounded and narrower then the rest., Use strong glue or another strong adhesive. Just make sure the blades are very well attached, or they could fly off when the windmill spins.   For best results, tilt the blades 35.5 degrees back from the plane of the hub.Eyeball this as slightly more than ⅓ of a right angle.  The motor powering this model windmill is very small, and probably can't power anything significant. Hook it up to the leads of a multimeter set to measure DC voltage instead. Depending on your blade design and wind strength, you will probably see a result of 0.2 to 0.5 volts once the windmill is running.   It is possible to get above 1 volt if the blades are made of stiff material, and have the right shape, size, and angle. In this case, you might be able to make an LED flicker. Red LEDs are the easiest to power.Put on safety goggles. Anyone near the windmill should wear safety goggles while the windmill is running. If a piece of the windmill breaks, it could fly off at high speed and injure someone. Reduce the risk by standing behind the windmill or in front of it, not on the side.  Set up the windmill so the hub is facing the wind directly. If the wind hits the blades at an angle, the force could snap the driveshaft or knock the motor loose from the windmill.   If there's not much wind today, you can test your windmill indoors in front of a strong fan, centered in front of the hub. The air from a fan is more turbulent than wind, so correct this by blowing the air through a "honeycomb" of paper towel tubes, milk cartons, or other open tubes.	Prepare the materials. Assemble two T-shapes from PVC pipe. Drill a hole in a new T-junction. Connect the two pieces into an H-shape. Attach four feet. Add the tall central pole. Find a small DC motor or dynamo. Fit together a 90º connector, short length of pipe, and coupling. Thread the wires through this section. Secure the motor at the opening of the coupling. Mount a hub over the driveshaft. Extend the motor wires. Thread the wires down through the windmill. Fit the two parts together. Attach rods to the hub. Cut out blades from stiff paper or other light materials. Attach the blades to the dowels. Hook the wires up to a multimeter. Test your windmill model.
One of the easiest ways to do this is to apply artist-quality Gesso, a thick gel-like primer.Apply it like paint, or spread it around with a palette knife, if it's thick enough. This will allow you to control the style of the texture.   You could also use heavy paper or poster board. If you do this, you won't need to prepare or prime the surface.  You should make several horizontal lines with varying spaces in between, as well as vertical lines. Mark as many as you like, but be aware that fewer lines will mean larger squares and rectangles.  Use black paint to create bold lines. You can make some lines thicker and others thinner. Your painting will now look like a grid with black lines.  Use primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and fill in several shapes with paint. While you could fill in every shape, this will make your painting look busy and overwhelming. Instead, choose just a few shapes to paint in. They'll stand out more.  The white space will make your primary colored squares pop.	Create a textured background. Use a ruler and pencil to create lines. Paint the lines. Paint only a few squares and rectangles. Leave the white space.
Combine ½ cup (118 ml) of water with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in a large microwave-safe bowl. Put the mixture in your microwave and nuke for roughly five minutes at its highest setting. Then let it sit with the door closed for about 10 to 15 minutes. This will enable any gunk or crusted bits of food to absorb the steam, which should work them loose and negate most odors., First, take out the bowl of water and vinegar. Be sure to wear oven mitts or another form of protection, since the bowl may still be hot. Then remove the glass plate, as well as the turntable support or rolling ring that the plate rests on (if your microwave has one)., Dampen a paper towel, microfiber cloth, or similar material. Use this to scrub the inside of your microwave, as well as the inside of the door. Repeat as necessary if you need more than one towel or cloth., If bits of food have cooked into a crust that’s too tough for a paper towel or cloth to handle, switch to a scrub brush. Combine one part water with two parts vinegar in a bowl or spray bottle. Then either dip your brush in or spray the area inside your microwave and scrub vigorously., Clean these in the sink as you would any regular dishware. Use warm water, dish soap, and a sponge to give them a thorough scrubbing. Rinse them under clean water and then dry them with a dish towel before placing them back in the microwave.	Microwave a water and vinegar mixture. Empty the microwave. Wipe the inside. Use a scrub brush for tougher grime. Clean the plate, plus its support or ring.
Each space on a Cranium board corresponds to a certain type of card. The cards contain activities that must be completed before your team can move across the board. There should be a small hourglass timer that comes with cranium that allows players one minute to complete the activity. If you do not have your timer, you can use a watch or phone to keep track of time. One type of card is the creative cat.   The creative cat card involves a creative activity. You may use the clay to make a sculpture and have another player guess what you're sculpting. You may also do a Pictionary-type drawing activity.Unless otherwise specified on the card, you can choose which team member performs the activity. When playing Creative Cat, it's a good idea to pick a more artistically inclined player. If someone is good at drawing or sculpting, allowing that person to engage in the activity will give your team a better chance at winning.  Data Head cards are simple trivia cards. They have regular types of trivia in addition to true/false and multiple choice questions. To successfully complete this activity, you need to answer the questions correctly.Choose a player with a knack for trivia to complete this activity. If someone is good at something like bar trivia or Trivial Pursuit, they'll be your best bet for this activity. If you're chosen for a Data Head activity and you don't know the answer, go with your gut response. Many times, trivia answers are things we've learned at some point but do not consciously remember. If you have a gut feeling one answer is right, take a shot. You should be especially willing to take this risk if the answer is multiple choice or True/False. You'll have a 25-50% chance of being correct., Word Worm cards involve challenges with words. Words may be scrambled, for example, or you may have to guess the definition of a given word.Pick a player with a good vocabulary for this card. People who read a lot or who write for a living might be better at defining or unscrambling words. If anyone on your team has a background in etymology or linguistics, choose them for this activity. Oftentimes, the roots used in words offer a hint to their meaning. Someone who's studied words academically is more likely to pick up on these subtleties.  Star Performer cards are slightly more elaborate. They come in three different categories.   Humdinger cards involve humming the tune to a popular song. The other player has to guess what song you are humming.If you have a Humdinger, you should pick someone that is able to carry. Also choose someone who knows popular music. Someone who's a classically trained pianist could potentially be great at humming. However, if this person has spent his whole life playing Chopin he might not know the tune to a Bruce Springsteen song offhand. Copycat cards require you to act like a famous person.Pick a team member who's fun-loving, uninhibited, and somewhat dramatic. The more someone is willing to put themselves out there and perform, the better chance you have of guessing the answer. As with a humdinger card, make sure it's someone well acquainted with pop culture so they'll recognize the name on the card. Cameo cards are similar to charades in which you have to get the other player to guess a particular person, place, or thing by silently acting out clues.Yet again, someone who is willing to put themselves out there and perform is your best choice.  Some cards have a "club cranium" symbol on them. When a team draws such a card, all players have to join in. Whichever team successfully completes the activity first gets to move across the board.Try to focus on your own team during the activity. Listening in on other players can cause stress, distracting you from your own players. Remember to have fun. Getting too competitive during board games can take away some of the entertainment value.	Play Creative Cat. Try Data Head. Use the Word Worm card. Do a Star Performer card. Play a club cranium card.
Buy an insecticide dust or spray that’s specifically for killing spiders. You can spray an aerosol insecticide directly on a spider to successfully kill it. If the spider you’re trying to kill is especially agile, you may want to apply an insecticide dust to the entire room., Get out your vacuum cleaner and suck the spider up with it. This is a better method to go with if your vacuum has a bag that you can easily remove and throw away. Don’t reach your hand in the debris if you use a bagless vacuum in case the spider is still alive., Use your shoe or a rolled-up magazine or newspaper to squish the spider.To ensure that the impact kills the spider, have confidence and use force.  Once you’ve killed the spider, double check to make sure that it’s dead, and then use a paper towel to carefully pick it up and throw it in your trash can or drop it into your toilet and flush it.   Pets and young children often attempt to eat anything and everything. Even if the venomous spider is dead, it still may have poisonous venom that could be extremely harmful if ingested.	Spray the spider or dust the area with an insecticide. Vacuum the spider up. Squish the spider with a heavy object. Dispose of the spider immediately.
As noted before, you must be extremely careful about safety concerns if you are going to use a torch. However, a torch will melt gold within a few minutes.   The gold should be placed into a crucible. Then, put the crucible on a fireproof surface, and direct a torch toward the gold within the crucible. If you add the chemical borax to the gold first, you can melt it at lower temperatures, which might be needed if you’re using a torch. Be careful to bring the torch down slowly if you have fine powdered gold in the crucible because you could easily blow it around. Heating the crucible too fast also could crack it. You want to heat it thoroughly and slowly. An oxy-acetylene torch will melt the gold faster than propane.With a torch, hold the flame well above the gold powder and slowly work in a circular motion. Once the powder begins to heat up and turn red, you can begin to work the torch in slowly until your powder is reduced to a nugget.  You need to decide what you are going to do with the melted gold. Perhaps you want to sell it in a new form. You could try to make an ingot out of it or another shape, like a gold bar.   Pour the melted gold into the ingot mold or other mold before it hardens. Then, let the gold cool. The mold should be made from similar material as the crucible Don’t forget to clean up your mess! You never want to leave heat sources unattended or in the reach of children.	Try using a propane torch to melt gold. Shape your melted gold.
Travel to a geographical region where salamanders generally reside. One-third of all salamander species can be found in North America, specifically in the Appalachian Mountains region. Salamanders also reside throughout Central America, South America, Asia, and Europe., There are over 700 different species of salamanders in the world, and they all come in a variety of sizes and colors. Salamanders have long, smooth bodies and four limbs, and they can be a small as 2 inches long, while others can grow to 4 feet long!Some species of salamanders are brightly colored, which can indicate that they are poisonous.The hellbender is a type of large salamander found in North America, which can grow up to 2.5 feet in length!Northern red salamanders are typically found in Maryland and live in natural springs. They are a bright, beautiful red with black flecks.Some salamanders, such as the axolotl or the Mexican salamander, are pale pink or white. These types of salamanders live underground and are rarely exposed to sunlight., Most salamanders live underground but will move out of dormancy in the spring to breed in vernal pools, which are shallow depressions in the ground that contain water during this time of year. This is the best time of year to search for these critters in the wild.  Locations near wetlands, streams, rivers, ponds, marshes, and swamps are ideal locations for salamanders to make their home.Most salamanders have a long larval stage and spend most of their early life in the water, much like frogs do.These moist environments are ideal for catching a glimpse of these animals in the wild.  Edge environments, or eco tones, describe areas where two different habitats meet.Salamanders can often be found in these environments, so be sure to look near the shorelines of streams or near shrubs and bushes near shallow water.Salamanders may also be found around seeps, which are areas where ground water slowly moves toward the surface.Keep an eye out for springs, seeps, and other boggy areas where these amphibians often make their home., Salamanders are carnivorous and eat a variety of insects and worms. In the wild, a salamander will eat crickets, worms, larvae, spiders, slugs—pretty much anything that it can easily swallow! If you know where to find their favorite meals, you may have a greater chance of spotting a salamander scurrying about.Many of the insects in the salamander's diet can be found under logs, rocks, and branches, so you may spot a salamander lurking around these areas. Larger salamanders will often eat frogs and smaller salamanders, while aquatic salamanders will eat small fish, crayfish, and other small aquatic creatures.If you come across a pool of still moving water with lots of rocks and tree roots, take a closer look! Crayfish are often found there, so your chances of spotting a salamander are greater., Make plans to search for salamanders at night or when the weather is overcast and rainy. Salamanders are nocturnal and can usually be found at night; however, they may also venture out during daytime hours when it is cloudy or raining.	Visit the salamander’s home. Know what to look for. Wait for spring. Visit damp locations. Look in edge environments. Look for their food sources. Search at night or on rainy days.
Throw all papers away and if you find pieces to a game, chuck those too, unless you know what game they go to. If you don't, the game is not important enough.; , Give yourself a half hour or else the clock wins, and no one likes losing to a thing that doesn't have a brain.  Most of the time this is very helpful in getting you in the mood to clean. If you have the music on, you could tidy whilst dancing. For instance, if you had something one side of the room and it needed to be the other, you could twirl, fox trot or even Cha-Cha your way there! Put on your phone music!!  , This will help you start cleaning your room. Don't look at it as the big picture because you will get discouraged.  This just leads to procrastination.  This will help you clean faster. Make sure you really want to do this goal, though.  Turn on the radio, and listen to a local radio station. These are the words to live by while you are cleaning and throughout your life.  Parents will most likely look under the bed, and in your closet as well. In other words, actually clean your room, don't just shove trash and junk in places that seem convenient just to get it over with. Only put things in your closet or under your bed if it really belongs there.  If your parents do it for you, you will never learn from experiences that you will come upon later in life.  You may become distracted very easily!  , You won't be tempted by the snacks in the pantry when you're cleaning.  Then, fast forward your video and show all your friends how hard working you are!	Set up a trash bag as a basketball hoop and if you don't make it in you lose the game. Pretend it is a race against the clock. Try turning on the radio or singing. Focus on one certain area at a time. Don't take a break. Set a goal that you want to do once you get out of your room. Don't worry, be happy. Don't put anything under your bed or in your closet, no matter what. Don't have your parents do it for you. Turn off any social networking sites. Have a snack before you clean!, Set up your camera and record all your cleaning process.
