The game will proceed clockwise (or counterclockwise, if you prefer) around the circle from the person who is going first. It does not matter whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise as long as you all agree on the direction.  Pass out the cards one at a time. Whoever drew the highest card is the first dealer. If you are going clockwise, start by giving the card at the top of the deck to the person to your left. Continue around the circle in this manner until each person has one face-down card. Then, keep dealing around the circle in the same pattern until everyone has the right amount of cards.   Deal the cards face-down so that each player knows which cards he or she has. If you accidentally reveal a card, slide it back into the dealing pile at random. If you are the dealer, you still get cards! Don't leave yourself out. Again: you don't have to deal exactly seven cards to each person as long as everyone has the same amount of cards. Some people play a variation in which the dealer can arbitrarily choose how many—or how few—cards to deal at the beginning of each round.  Once you deal, you should have an extra stack of cards left. Place these cards face-down in the middle of the floor or table where you're playing. Everyone in the game should be able to easily reach this stack.   Designate a space next to these cards for the Discard pile. This is where you'll put the cards that get knocked out of play.	Sit in a circle. Deal each player seven cards without looking at them. Stack the leftover cards in the center.
One of the dangers of the holiday season is that you schedule too much and don't budget enough time for sleep and exercise. These 2 practices can cut your stress level in half and make it easier to stay on task during your holiday rush.   It is common to reduce your exercise time slightly during the holidays, but try to get about 30 minutes of mid-intensity cardiovascular exercise 5 times per week. Don't not cut down on your sleep; aim for 8 hours per night. Moderate your alcohol intake. Although it may seem like a sedative, it can actually prevent you from getting deep sleep. Stop after a few drinks to avoid losing your energy the next day.; , Take into account how much you can afford and then split the money between cards, postage stamps, gifts, decorations, clothing, food and even a party.   Plan an overage of 10 percent in your budget. This means all of your needs should add up to 90 percent of the money you have for the holidays.  If you love control, this may be hard to do; however, it will take a load off your shoulders and make everyone feel like the holidays don't come together magically.  If your budget is tight, then giving 1 present or buying 1 big present for the whole family might be better. Studies have also shown that charity projects can help your emotional health during stressful times.  Ticket prices tend to go up right before the holidays. Make sure you have lower travel costs and less stress associated with travel if you and your children or parents have their plans figured out in advance.  Place all commitments, deadlines, family nights and tasks on it so that everyone can refer back to it over the month of December.	Plan for sleep. Set a budget 2 months before the holidays. Sit down with your family 6 weeks before the holiday and ask for help. Discuss the possibility of doing a low-gift giving Christmas or a charity project with your family. Book travel plans 3 or more months before the holidays. Use a calendar that everyone can see, online or in the house.
When you have a new business idea, be circumspect. Don't go around telling lots of people about it or your idea might be stolen. In selecting a mentor, be sure that this person is trustworthy and has no reason to undermine your attempts at starting out. More than this, be sure to choose someone who is positive, upbeat, and motivating. There is nothing more off-putting than someone whose negativity about your proposals! Ignore the naysayers, those who provide the figures of failed businesses; that's negativity you can do without.; , The mentor must be good at running a business inside out, from the bottom to the top. Your mentor should have at least 10 years experience in the business field and have a track record that shines. Note how this person has overcome failures too; if they bounced back and did even better, this person is ideal!  , It's no good bagging a great mentor only to never see him or her. Check straight away if they can spare a couple of hours a week for a month or two to sit down together and run through all of the issues. Always be prepared to shout them coffee, a meal, etc. because this person is doing you an enormous favor. If they seek payment from you, that's fine too; negotiate a fair deal and include as part of your start-up costs – view it as insurance for the security of the future business.  While you won't be able to access the Richard Bransons and Estee Lauders of the world unless you've got personal friendships with them, you can learn from their experiences. There are many books, online resources and articles written by high level business people who can inspire and motivate your, as well as revealing the pitfalls and success strategies that they have experienced.  The stories of successful companies are well worth reading. They are not always about one dominant personality but are often a combination of leadership and great team skills. How this achieved is an important lesson to avail yourself of as you aim to build up good staff in your company. The company that's always cited as an incredible success story is that of Southwest Airlines but there are many other good ones out there too – look at Fortune's top companies for ideas of which to research.  Such places can provide an enormous range of great information to help you learn about starting a business and they often have free advisers available to talk you through government laws, business ideas, the dos and don'ts, etc.  Your accountant and your lawyer will prove good mentors if you ask them for help. They also tend to know other people to refer you to for more detailed advice in specific areas.  More general business mentoring can be found in the form of joining organizations relevant to your particular business. You will benefit from networking, from seminars, from dinner events, guest speakers, etc. and might even be able to tap into an advice line if one is offered. Think outside the square too – business can be extra challenging for women, so this can be a huge source of help, so if you are a businesswoman, consider joining a women's professional network of support.	Take heed of whom you choose. Find someone who is very experienced in business. Find someone who has the time to spend with you. Look to the top. Look at companies. Visit a government sponsored business bureau. Use the people who will be helping your business as a source of mentors. Use professional resources.

Before you do anything else, ensure that the fan is turned off and cannot turn back on until you are finished cleaning it.Most models will have a plug that is located directly behind the cover. You could remove the cover first and unplug the fan, but just to be safe, go and temporarily pull the breaker for your bathroom. The fan is now safe to work on.  Dust will fall when the cover is removed. To avoid the dust, position your stepladder such that you can reach the cover, but are not standing directly below it. Most covers will have two prongs on opposite sides holding it in place, others just need to be unscrewed. Remove the cover by pressing these prongs in, then set the cover aside.  Unscrew the assembly that is holding the fan in place, then very gently remove the fan. Be careful not to drop the fan or hit it on the side of the exhaust pipe as that could potentially chip the fan blades. Broken fan blades will cause the fan to be louder and less effective.	Turn off the power. Remove the cover. Remove the fan.

,  Remove the laminate, linoleum or wood finished floor. Remove the subfloor.  Remove all of the adhesive and old material until you reach the concrete base. Once clear of all material, grind the slab as needed to provide a solid surface to bond to., The purpose of the PVA glue is to consolidate the porous slab surface so that good bonding with the leveler/screed will occur.  Put the glue in the paint tray and apply with the foam roller using the telescopic rod. Let the floor dry thoroughly for three or four days.  Check the level of of the slab for any differences and, if necessary, apply self-leveling floor screed.  Mix the screed according to the package directions:  in a bucket by hand or in a bucket using a mixing blade attached to a powerful drill or in a commercial cement mixer.   Keep working until the mixture achieves a uniform consistency. Immediately the pour mixture onto the floor and, using a board or float, distribute the mixture evenly over the surface. Roll with a special purpose screed roller with spikes. Let the floor dry completely.   Put down a polyethylene film with a thickness of 100 microns over the whole floor. Overlap the joints at least 10 cm (4").   Use solid polypropylene insulating panels. The installation is simplified by an interlocking design from the factory consisting of docking slots. The panels are easy to adjust to any room, because they are easily cut to size or trimmed using an ordinary utility knife. Don't forget to glue the edges of with Liquid Nails or a similar adhesive.  It is best to use OSB or fiberboard with tongue and groove joints and leave a gap of 0.5 cm (1/8") between pieces and along the walls to allow for expansion. You can use purchased plastic wedges as spacers. Tap the sheets with a hammer to fit the tongue into the groove, making sure to protect the edge of the sheets with a wooden block.  To secure the subfloor, use screws and anchors at 35 centimeter (13.8 in) spacings (14" centers).   Remove the plastic wedges. Apply wood putty (dispensed from a tube with the caulk gun) to all joints and screw heads, smoothing it with a putty spatula as you go. Let the putty dry and start laying a linoleum or laminate or parquet floor.	Purchase the necessary materials and tools. , Disassemble the existing flooring. Prepare the slab. Prime the slab surface with a primer based, deep penetrating PVA (polyvinyl acetate) glue. Assure the slab is perfectly level. Install the vapor barrier. Install the thermal insulation. Install the subfloor. Finish the subflooring, making sure everything is sealed and smooth.
You want the agreement to be readable so that the sales representative fully understands the terms. Open a word processing document and set the font to a comfortable size and type. Times New Roman 12 point works for many people.   You probably will hire more than one sales representative, so you should set up your agreement as a template. Insert blank lines for information that will change with each contract, such as the name of the sales rep and the date.; , Center “Sales Representative Agreement” between the right- and left-hand margins. You want the title to stand out, so put it in all caps, bold, and underlined., In the opening paragraph of the agreement, you should identify the parties. Also state the date you are signing the agreement and the business location of each party.   Sample language could read: “This Agreement is made on , by and between , which has a primary business address at (‘Company’) and , an individual with a primary residence at (‘Sales Representative,’ ‘Representative’).”, Your recitals summarize why each party is entering into the agreement. Recitals can be fragment sentences and are often introduced with the word “Whereas.” Your recitals could read:   “Whereas, Company is engaged in the business of (‘Products’); Company desires to retain Sales Representative, and Sales Representative desires to be retained, as Company’s sales representative within the territory and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Therefore, the parties, for good and valuable consideration, hereby agree as follows.”, You should define any terms that might be unclear to the sales representative or to a judge. You can draft this section last. Once you have completed a draft, go through the entire document and check for any words that may be unclear.   You should certainly define “territory” and “confidential information,” since those are critical terms in your agreement.  You should include a provision where you explicitly appoint the sales representative. If the representative will be your exclusive rep in the territory, then clarify that.   You could write: “Company appoints Representative, and Representative accepts the appointment, to act as Company’s sales representative in the Territory for the sale of the Products during the Term.”, Your rep might only service a certain geographical location. If so, then you should define that territory. Even if you define the territory in this clause, you still should include a definition of “territory” in the definitions section.   If you want the representative to work the entire U.S., then you could define territory this way: “The term ‘Territory’ shall mean the United States of America.”, You don’t want the representative to be confused as to whether he or she is an employee, so explicitly state that they are an independent contractor. Also clarify that you are not creating a partnership or other joint venture with the sales representative.   For example, you could write: “The parties agree that Representative is an independent contractor, and not an employee, of Company. This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or agent-principal relationship between the parties. Neither the Representative nor any directors, officers, employees or agents shall represent themselves as an agent, partner, or employee of Company.”, You should think carefully about what you want the sales representative to do. Of course, some duties are obvious: sell your goods to consumers. However, you should be as comprehensive as possible. For example, you might want to include the following duties:Sell a minimum number of products/accounts. Place sales orders with you on forms that you provide the sales representative. Use best efforts to aggressively solicit customers. Follow state and local laws so that the sales representative is qualified to do business. Consult with you about advertising. Follow your pricing list (i.e., not set its own prices).  Explain how often reports should be submitted. For example, you could receive sales reports every month or every quarter. You also should generally state what should be in the reports, such as sales and potential sales.   For example, you could request: “Within fifteen (15) days of the close of each calendar month, Representative shall submit to Company a written report setting forth the following: sales for that month, potential sales in the future, information about the commercial conditions in the Representative’s territory, and any other necessary information.”, Typically, sales representatives are paid on a commission, which means that they receive a percentage of each sale. You should spell out how you will calculate the commission. If the calculation is complicated—for example, you will give bonuses for certain benchmarks met—then you can include the explanation of commissions in an attachment, titled “Exhibit A.”Also reserve a right to revise the commission schedule: “Company shall have the right to revise said schedule from time to time, upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice to Sales Representative.”  , The agreement can last however long you want it to last. However, it is pretty standard to set up an agreement to last one year. Also explain how you can renew the agreement once it expires., If either party breaks the agreement, then the other party might want to terminate. You should explain how either party can terminate the agreement, e.g., by sending written notice.   For example, you might write, “Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for ‘good cause’ upon ten (10) days’ advance written notice to the other party setting forth the breach. The term ‘good cause’ means a breach of any obligation under this Agreement.”, You should clarify that if the agreement is terminated, the sales representative must return the confidential information to you. You also should say something to the effect that you will pay any commission that was earned before the termination.   You could write: “Termination of this Agreement for any reason does not affect the obligations that have accrued as of the date of termination. Representative shall return to Company any Confidential Information, and Representative’s limited license to use Company’s intellectual property ceases immediately.”, You don’t want the sales rep to think that because he or she is selling your goods that they own rights to your intellectual property. Clarify that you are the sole owner.   You could write, “Company shall at all times own and retain all intellectual property rights in Products. Company grants Representative a limited license to use Company’s name and trademarks in order to market and sell the Product.”, You should get the rep to agree not to divulge confidential information, including sales plans, customer lists, trade secrets, or other information that has value. If the sales rep violates this agreement, then you can sue. You could include the following non-disclosure agreement:   “In the course of business, it may be necessary for Company or Company’s customers to disclose Confidential Information. Company is the sole owner of this Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring to Sales Representative any rights in the Confidential Information, except for the use as expressly provided in this Agreement. Representative shall hold the Confidential Information in strictest confidence for the sole and exclusive benefit of Company. Representative shall not, without prior written consent, use the Confidential Information for its own benefit or disclose it to others, and Representative shall disclose the Confidential Information only to employees with a need to know if such employees have executed an agreement imposing the substantially same duty to respect the confidentiality of the information as that imposed on Representative.”, If the sales representative is sued, then you might also be added as a defendant. For example, the representative could be sued for misrepresenting a product. In this situation, an indemnification agreement will protect you.   The following is an acceptable indemnification clause: “Each party hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless the other party and its affiliates, successors, and assigns, and its directors, officers, and employees against any claims, loss, demands, damages, costs, penalties, causes of action, judgments, attorney’s fees or any other expense incurred in connection with a party’s actions or failure to act or any breach of a term of this Agreement.”, If the sales representative sues you, you can try to limit what kinds of damages they can get in court. You should include a limitation on liability provision and exclude any special or consequential damages.   Your provision might read: “Regardless of the basis on which a party may be entitled to recover damages from the other party, the aggregate liability under this agreement is limited to actual, direct damages. The amount cannot exceed the total amount of commissions paid by the Company to the Representative for the six-month period preceding the event that give rise to the dispute. The liable party in no event shall be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including lost savings, business opportunities, profits, or business advantages, even if the party has been advised in advance of the probability of these damages.”, You should tell the other party where to send written notice to you. You can also specify how notice should be delivered. For example, you might want a fax sent to a certain number or you might want to receive a letter delivered certified mail.   Your provision could read: “Any notice required by this Agreement shall be in writing and mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the other party at the address listed on the first page. The notice will be deemed delivered on the date of receipt or upon attempted delivery if acceptance is refused.”, You should state in your agreement what law will govern the contract. Typically, you should choose the law of the state where you are located.   Your provision could read: “This Agreement is subject to the laws of the State of Florida.”, If a judge or arbitrator finds that one provision of the agreement is not enforceable, then the rest of the agreement could be voided. To prevent this from happening, you can include a severability clause. This clause will state that the remainder of the agreement should remain in force even if one provision is voided.A sample severability clause could read: “If any provision is prohibited or found unenforceable, then the remaining provisions shall remain in force.”  , You want to state that your written agreement with the sales representative contains all of the agreements between the two of you. You don’t want the rep to come forward claiming that there was a prior oral agreement that differs from the written agreement. Your merger clause can prevent this.   A standard merger clause reads: “This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, understandings, and agreements, if any. Furthermore, neither this Agreement nor any provision may be modified, waived, or terminated orally, but only by a writing signed by both parties.”, You can resolve disputes outside of court if each side agrees to arbitration. If you include an arbitration agreement in your contract, then it will be enforced if a dispute arises between you and the sales representative. Arbitration is like a trial except you present your dispute to one or more arbitrators. Arbitration is private and generally faster than a lawsuit.   Your arbitration provision could read: “Any controversy or claim that arises out of this Agreement, or is related to it, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association, under its Commercial Rules. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.”, You should include lines for both you and the sales representative to sign. Include a line for the date, printed name, signature, and title.   Just above the signature lines, include this language: “In witness whereof, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth in the first paragraph.”, This article describes a basic sales representative agreement. Depending on your circumstances, you may need to add different provisions. You should meet with a qualified attorney who can listen to you describe your needs and recommend changes to the agreement.   You can find a qualified lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Call and schedule a consultation.  The sales representative should read the agreement before signing. If he or she has suggested changes, then you should discuss them. Don’t agree to anything that you don’t want to.   After each side signs the completed agreement, you should give the sales representative a copy.	Format your document. Add a title at the top. Identify yourself and the sales representative. Add your recitals. Include a definitions section. Appoint the sales representative. Define the representative’s territory. Clarify that the rep is an independent contractor. List the sales representative’s duties. Tell the representative when to submit written reports. Explain how the representative’s compensation is calculated. Identify the duration of the agreement. Explain how to terminate for good cause. Explain the effect of termination. Clarify that you own the intellectual property. Include a non-disclosure agreement. Add an indemnification agreement. Include a limitation on liability provision. Add a notice provision. Include a choice of law provision. Add a severability clause. Include a merger clause. Remember to add an arbitration clause. Insert signature blocks. Show your draft to a lawyer. Negotiate with the representative over changes.
Draw a circle and a curved line under that for the chin. Add guidelines like those shown to help you with the facial features. The proportions for the face are up to you, and will vary depending on whether you want it to be realistic or cartoony. The illustrations show a cute, cartoon girl (so the proportions are not very realistic).  Draw two half-circles for the ears, on the same guideline as the eyes.  They can be larger or look different, however, if you want a less cartoonish or cute-looking girl.  Draw bangs for her and make her hair short, or keep it long and wavy. Use your imagination.  Draw a small neck for her, a circle for the upper body and an oval for the lower body.  Draw small circles for the hands and feet. Put in cute little ovals for her fingers. You don’t have to include the detail of fingernails, but if you do, make them fairly short and emphasize them later by coloring them in (to serve as nail polish).  Add a pattern if you want, or just draw a simple dress. Draw some shoes and add a floppy hat or a ribbon for her hair.  The specifics are up to you--again, be creative!  , You can also add some sort of background or another outside element to your drawing at this point, such as shadowing.  You’re done!	Sketch the head. Add two circles for the eyes and two thin curved lines above that for the eyebrows. Add a small nose and tiny pair of lips. Sketch in the hair. Now sketch in the body. For the arms and legs, draw 2 connected ovals each. Sketch in her dress. Add final lines and any additional details, like eyelashes, ribbons, etc. Outline the little girl and erase the guidelines. Color her and her clothes in.
If you don’t already have a charitable cause in mind, you will need to choose one to investigate. There are a number of different types of charities that provide support or service to many kinds of groups.   Medical charities can help raise money to find cures or help people living with disease or disability. Educational charities help under privileged students get a good education or pursue college degrees. Veteran charities provide housing to injured veterans and support treatment facilities. There is likely a charity that benefits something you’re passionate about.; , If you have decided that you would like to donate your time or money to a medical charity, you should determine what cause within that category you feel the strongest about. While there are charities that invest in a broad range of things, you may find that you would rather support a charity that works specifically with breast cancer or diabetes, for instance.   There are specialized charities within each broad category. Do some research on charitable causes within your field of interest.  The easiest way to choose a charitable cause is to think about issues in your life that you feel deserve addressing. Maybe you lost a loved one to a disease that has no cure, or you remember having the music program canceled at your school as a child.Charitable giving is a way to right a wrong you see in the world. Think about what things you would like to see change. It will be easier to support a charity that you have an emotional connection to.  There are a number of websites that specialize in providing people quick and easy access to lists of the charities they’re looking for. Many sites also provide information about the charities like financial statements and overhead costs.   Websites like CharityNavigator.com allow you to search by a number of categories or simply peruse lists of charities sorted by various topics. Givewell.org and CharityWatch.org both keep extensive lists of charities and rank them based on a series of criteria to help you make a better informed decision.  You may not find the charity of your choosing on a charity search engine, so you may need to confirm that the charity is reputable. While charitable giving is a noble endeavor, there are people that try to take advantage of others by posing as charitable foundations. These fake charities can have elaborate websites and seem extremely official, so it’s best to confirm a charity is legitimate via a third party: preferably an official source.Look up the charity you’ve chosen on a website like CharityWatch.org if you haven’t already. If it is a local charity, you can contact your state attorney general or charity bureau to confirm their legitimacy.  If you have decided that you want to support a charity that benefits people within your community, you will want to make sure the charity you’ve found has a reach that includes your local area. Many charities work specifically within regions, so you want to make sure you find one that works within yours if the locality of the service they provide is important to you.For instance, if you would like to support a charity that benefits police officers, you may choose to support the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. However, if you want to ensure your support benefits your local law enforcement, you may want to choose a more locally oriented charity.  If you intend to donate money, you may want to determine how the money you provide will be used. All charities have overhead costs, but you may be surprised to know that the amount of donated money put toward the actual charitable cause can vary significantly depending on the organization.A “top tier” charity will put 75% or more of donated funds toward the actual charitable cause. Many charity search engines like Charity Watch and Charity Navigator will provide you with this information through a quick search.  Charities often record your personal information along with your donation for tax and future outreach purposes. As a result, the charity you choose will have information about you that could be extremely marketable to third party agencies.Review their privacy policy online to make sure they don’t sell donor information to other non-profits, mailing houses or telemarketers. If a charity does not have a posted privacy policy, contact them to ask about it.  The first thing most people think of when it comes to donating to charity is money. Money makes the world go ‘round and can be significant to charitable organizations. Charities use your donation to provide help to people who need it and pay for the cost of managing the organization itself. Remember that your donations are often tax deductible, but don’t overextend yourself by donating more than you can afford. Consider setting up a smaller donation that repeats on a regular basis to provide continued support without putting too big of a dent in your wallet at any one time.  Many charities need volunteers as much as they need money. Charity work can be extremely rewarding and give you the opportunity to see the good you are doing in real time. If you have any specialized skills, your donated time could be extremely valuable and useful to a charity.Contact the charity to see if there are any volunteer services they are particularly in need of. They may need people to assist in outreach or administration that requires little to no training or experience. Some charities may be in need of whatever you currently do for a living. Let them know what you do and see if it can help. You may be able to donate time from home if they need help with social media or community outreach.  Blood and organ donors are always in demand. Donating blood can save lives and won’t cost you much more than some time and a little light-headedness. Donating bone marrow or an organ would require a significantly larger sacrifice, but you may feel the good you would be doing would be worth it.You could choose to become an organ donor when you pass away instead of donating now. The Red Cross and other organizations often have blood drives going on in cities around the country. Check out RedCross.org to find a donation center near you. You could also contact your state or local charity bureau to find out about other medical donation cites in your area.	Decide on a category. Narrow your search. Do an inventory of what’s important to you. Use a charity search engine. Confirm the charity’s legitimacy. Confirm the scope of the charity. Find out how the charity will use your donation. Ask about the charity’s privacy policy. Donate money. Donate time. Donate blood or organs.
Cash is the most widely accepted form of payment for a money order. You can go to any money order provider and purchase a money order with cash. You simply pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee.Companies that issue money orders want the most secure form of payment possible because once they issue the money order, their money is as good as gone. You can also pay with a debit card linked to your bank account. You cannot pay for a money order with a personal check. Checks can take a few days to process. If you don’t have sufficient funds, the money order issuer loses the money.; , The only place you can purchase a money order with a traveler’s check is at the United States Post Office (USPS). You will have to pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee based on the money order amount. When you pay, sign the traveler’s check in front of the postal service worker who is preparing the money order for you.USPS is willing to accept traveler’s checks because they recognize them as a form of cash., Some money order issuers allow you to use a credit card, but not all. You can use a credit card to purchase a money order at Western Union and 7-Eleven. It is expensive to buy a money order with a credit card. Your card issuer will likely view it like a cash advance. This means they will charge you the higher interest rates and fees associated with cash advances. Also, you don’t earn any points or rewards on cash advances, so you won’t earn them for purchasing a money order either., You can pay with one of these cards at Western Union, Walmart, the post office and 7-Eleven. However, doing so is often linked with suspicious activity. For example, some people purchase these pre-paid cards and then immediately liquidate them in order to take advantage of any available rewards the cards offer. Then they deposit the money orders into their bank accounts and use the money to pay their bills. But depositing lots of money orders into your bank account looks like money laundering, and your bank can close your account for doing so., Some companies now allow you to purchase and send a money order online. For example, you can purchase a money order online with Payko and pay with your PayPal account, which is linked to a credit card or bank account. However, you can only purchase a single, $200 money order per day. This method is not as fast as other online bank transfers. Instead of an instantaneous transfer of funds from one account to another, a physical money order is printed out and mailed to the recipient. This can take several days.Sending money over the phone is possible, but this is not the same thing as a money order. You can contact a remittance service like Western Union and request an electronic transfer of funds over the phone. You can pay with a credit or debit card. However, a physical money order is not printed out in this case. Rather, the funds are transferred from your bank account to the recipient’s account electronically.	Use cash. Buy a money order with traveler’s checks. Purchase a money order with a credit card. Pay with a PIN-enabled Visa or MasterCard gift card. Purchase a money order remotely.
Once you have decided to reduce your energy costs (and there’s no reason for not doing so), you should start from making a well thought-out plan. If it is a small business, you can do it yourself; otherwise you should delegate this task to some individual or a team, who’ll submit a report after visiting all departments and considering different options for saving costs.; , This is such a straightforward energy saving step, yet ignored by many offices and businesses.   The light must comply with international standards for workplace, but for whatever reasons, some businesses go beyond these requirements and install excessive lights in the factory or workplace. Even more bizarre is the case, when lights and other electrical appliances are left switched on around the clock. If there are lots of computers, printers or other electric equipments in your office, don’t just rely on issuing a notice, directing the workers to shut down their PC’s before leaving. , There are many options available in the market, offering reasonable performance with sufficient reduction in energy consumption. For example, laptops consume less energy than desktop PC’s; therefore you should consider using laptops instead of computers with power hungry monitors.    Heating or cooling at workplace should be used to the extent of ensuring comfortable working conditions. Discourage the use of air conditioners, when switching on a simple ceiling fan will do the job.  Let them know how energy saving will add to the overall profitability of the business, and how a profitable business will eventually be able to pay better salaries and bigger bonuses to its workers.	Make a plan. One of the most basic (and the most obvious) things to do is to turn off all lights, computers and other electrical appliances, which are not in use. Instead, assign this task to someone in the office, who must do a round and make sure all computers and equipments are properly switched off.  , Consider the energy requirements when buying vehicles or other office equipment. Ask your staff to use heating/cooling systems at moderate levels (room temperature set at some point within 70 – 78 is perfectly normal). Before implementing these energy-saving steps, call for a meeting and share the advantages of energy saving with your staff.
Water will only make it worse. It will keep the wax from drying and allow it to sink deeper into the carpet fibers.; , You will use these to cool the ice but you want to make sure you don’t get the wax wet. Using a plastic bag will keep moisture from leaking into the wax which can prevent it from drying., Do this until the wax is cooled completely and no longer soft.If you need a little extra strength you can use wart freezing spray. This can be found at most local drug stores. Simply spray it over the wax and let it harden.  Be careful not to saw at the carpet fibers as they may fray. Do this a few times to ensure you've gotten rid of as much wax as possible with the knife.   Using a dull blade lessens the chance of permanent damage (such as fraying) to your carpet  , Wax will flake away under the butter knife. To ensure the wax flakes don't stray and become a problem again, vacuum them immediately.	Don’t put water on the wax. Put some ice cubes in a plastic bag. Rub the wax with the ice cube. Scrape the wax away with a butter knife.Place the side of the blade towards the carpet and gently pull towards you and up. Vacuum the wax chunks.
Only having one or two markers will make it difficult to get a smooth look. The more markers you use the better the end result will be.   Copic sells packs of three markers that are good blending combinations so you can create a gradient look. They also have a pack of 5 that consists of skin tone colored markers.; , The lightest color in your group of markers is what color the skin will end up looking like, so choose that marker wisely. Once you have your markers together, test them out before using them on your drawing. This will prevent you from accidentally using a marker that doesn't match the rest like you thought it would.  Take note of the best ways to blend the colors together, which is dragging the colors across each other (see photo for reference)       If you are using thin paper make sure to put something under it so you prevent stains on the surface you're using.  Don't go too in detail with the curves of the face. This should be done after the features are added so the face shape complements the features of the face better. Add in the cross-T that will help you with the placement of features. The horizontal line should be placed about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up the face depending on how big you'd like the forehead to be. The vertical line will sit in the middle of the face where the center of the nose will be.  When doing this be very light with your pencil and don't add detail to the skin. Things such as the bridge of the nose and crease of the eye will be added with the markers. This is due to how the markers react to pencil marks (the pencil will cause discoloration you won't be able to get rid of)  The eyes will be placed on the horizontal line of the cross-T with roughly half the eye above the line and half below. When deciding the distance between the eyes a general guideline is to put a "third eye" between them. This means that the space between the eyes should be about the width of one of the eyes itself.       The nose should be done on the vertical line of the cross-T. The length of the nose depends on your desired look, but generally should reach halfway between the horizontal T-line and the chin.       The lips should be placed low enough to allow room between the nose, but high enough that the chin isn't too small. Look at the space between the top of the lip and the chin. The lips should take up about half of that space, meaning you should be able to fit a "second set" of lips between the bottom lip and chin.       Now that you have the major features you can adjust the face shape. While doing this, make the cheekbones and jawline more defined.       Add the eyebrows with your desired shape. They can be as far from the eyes as you want, as this can create different expressions. A good way to know where the arch of the brow should be is by drawing a straight line from the edge of the nostril to the outer edge of the iris.       Erase your cross-T and any unnecessary pencil marks when done.    Using the darkest of your selected markers, outline the nose and face. Don't make the outline too thick or it will be difficult to create realistic shading.       Picking a light source will help you get realistic shading. If the light is coming straight on, shading will be even on both sides of the face. If it comes from the right, the darkest areas of the face will be on the left. Coming from the left the dark areas will be on the right. Using the same dark marker begin to lightly shade the darkest parts of the face, being sure to drag the marker towards the center of the face for better blending (see photo for reference). The darkest areas will be the bridge of the nose by the eye, the nostril area, the cheek hollows, under the lips, under/ above the eye and on the outer side of the eye. Also start to add details such as lines under the eyes and the cupids bow between the lip and nose.  Use your markers in order of dark to light. The lightest areas of the face will be the middle of the nose bridge, cheekbones, chin, and the forehead. Leave these areas for last so they are the lightest.  Make sure your strokes of the marker are going in the right direction and that you stay as consistent as possible with these directions. The more you go over the area with the marker the darker it will get, but the less you'll see the strokes.  Using a black marker, add the pupil, and also outline the eye so it stands out. Do this by making the line thick towards the outside of the eye and having it taper off. You can also use a thin marker to add eyelashes. Consider using the 0.3 Copic multiliner.   To add color to the eye, fill in the white space with the color you want the eye to be. Then take a dark shade of that color and outline the iris. The easiest way to create shading of the iris if your light source is from the right is the put the darker colors on the left, and vise versa. Then taking a skinny marker, create zigzags in a circle around the pupil to add the detail of the iris.                 Shade the whites of the eye by coloring them in a very light grey, making the greys darker as you move out from the iris. Try not to reach a black-ish color by the time you reach the edge of the eye whites.  Then create skinny hair-like lines where the color is light. If you want you can go back and create more hair texture in the rest of the eyebrow using a skinny marker.  This will allow you to build up.   Then take a dark color and outline the lips. Begin to shade, creating lines that lips naturally have.       Using your desired color, fill in the lips. Like the face you should taper the color off to the center of the lips. The middle of each lip should be the lightest part.  If using a dark hair color you can start the hairline a bit lower than the top of the forehead. Go with the grain of the hair so it looks like strands. Keep in mind where light would hit the hair and also where it would be darkest. Where the hair would be light, just do a few strands with the dark marker.    Overlapping your strokes will give a greater illusion of hair texture. Add layers of color like you did with the skin, leaving the light areas for your lightest marker. Add more hairs where you feel necessary.  Depending on if you want to add shoulders you can put in details such as the collarbone.  You can use the Copic opaque white bottle to do so.	Make sure you have a selection of similar markers that you will be able to use. Select 3 or more markers to use for the skin. Make the outline of the face using a pencil. Start to add in the features of the face. Before you use the markers, erase the nose so it's barely visible to avoid discoloration. Start to add on more layers of colors. Once you're happy with the way the skin looks, begin adding details to the eye. Fill in the eyebrows fully on the outside, tapering the color off as you reach the inner side. To color the lips, start with neutral shades if you have them. Start to outline the hair using the darkest shade of your chosen colors. Color the neck like you did the face. Add white areas on the lips and in the eyes to make it look shiny.
The photos could be themed, such as a family holiday or a child growing up through the ages, or simply random photos you like. You will want two large pictures––one on each side of the brick (or four if you're creating two bricks) and then two or three smaller pictures for each side of the brick. Determine if you want to cover the top of the brick––if so, find another picture. Use a ruler to take measurements so you know how big to print your pictures.  If your pictures are cataloged on your computer, print out enough pictures to cover both sides of each brick (two larger pictures), the two sides and top (several smaller pictures). Use camera-ready photo paper for the highest quality. Alternatively, have a photo store print the images for you.  You will have a framed photo on each side of the brick and then you'll decoupage the rest of the pictures onto the brick itself. Consider using frames that do not have stands and flat back surfaces so they can be easily affixed to the brick.  Use either liquid nails or silicone adhesive to make each frame stick. Hold in place for several minutes while it adheres and bonds to the brick.  You may just like the look of the two pictures frames and stop there. However, if you want to add more family memories, brush one layer of decoupage on a cleaned brick surface and then affix your photos. Wait about 20 minutes for the solution to dry and then add another layer. Perform this step three or four times and then spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project.	Select the desired photos. Print the pictures. Purchase or make two photo frames that are the same size as the brick. Place the pictures inside the frames and affix to the larger sides of the brick. Decoupage the brick sides and top with other photos.
Arkansas recognizes legal separation, which after 18 months can be used as a grounds for divorce. If you and your spouse are contemplating divorce but think that separating would be the best first step, there are certain things that you should do in order for the separation to be legally recognized.   You should draft a separation agreement, which sets forth child custody and support during the separation, divides property for purposes of the separation, and can also include spousal support during the separation. Your separation agreement can include any other terms that you and your spouse agree upon, such as continued health insurance or custody of a pet. Your separation agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.The agreement is considered legally binding and can be enforced as to all of the terms included in the agreement once both parties have signed the document. If you and your spouse cannot agree to the terms of the separation, you will attend a court hearing and a judge will decide any outstanding issues.The document can also be used as part of the divorce settlement, if both parties agree.By negotiating a separation agreement, you and your spouse have begun the process of understanding the issues that will be raised in a divorce proceeding and determining what issues are the most important to you when negotiating a divorce settlement.; , If you and your spouse both want to end the marriage, it is best if you can come to an agreement as to division of property, assets, debts, child custody and support and alimony together. If you can come to an agreement, the divorce is considered uncontested and this is less expensive and time consuming than a contested divorce. A mediator, is an independent third party experienced in negotiating divorce settlements, and can help you and your spouse reach an agreement.   Most Arkansas judges encourage mediation and will even order mediation if one of the parties to the divorce request it. You can have an attorney at mediation or you can represent yourself. Typically, both parties make an opening statement about the divorce and desired settlement. Both parties may also meet with the mediator alone and let him or her know their position and the mediator will try and work out an agreement. The mediator can also meet with the parties together and negotiate an agreement. If an agreement is made, the mediator will draft a Mediated Settlement Agreement, which both parties will sign. The agreement will be presented to the court when the parties file for divorce.Even if you and your spouse reach an agreement through mediation, you still have to file legal action for divorce. The mediated settlement agreement will be reviewed by the judge and will most likely become a part of the divorce decree. By having an agreement, the judge does not make decisions based on property division, custody or alimony. It also expedites the divorce proceeding.  Under Arkansas law, your or your spouse must have been a resident of the state for at least 60 days before filing for divorce or separation.   The court may also require proof that the spouses are separated and no longer live together. A third-party witness can prove the separation by either testifying in court to the fact that the parties are separated or signing a sworn statement, called an affidavit, in which they state that the parties are separated., Your divorce action must be filed in the Arkansas Circuit Court in the county where the party filing for divorce resides unless the party filing for divorce is not an Arkansas resident. In that case, the divorce should be filed in the county where the defendant (non-filing spouse) resides.   You can locate Arkansas Circuit Courts by county at: https://courts.arkansas.gov/courts/circuit-courts.  In Arkansas, you must state the grounds on which you are filing for divorce. You can seek a no-fault divorce if you have been legally separated for 18 months. If not, you can file for divorce based on fault. The grounds for divorce in Arkansas are:   Impotence Felony conviction Habitual drunkenness Cruel treatment Irreconcilable differences Adultery Incurable insanity for one year and living apart for one year Financial abandonment, Your Complaint is the legal filing that begins your divorce. You should check with the court clerk for any specific requirements but generally your Complaint should include the following:   The name of the court and the county where you are filing the Complaint. The name and address of the person filing the Complaint (the Plaintiff). The name and address of the non-filing spouse (the Defendant). The city and state where you were married and the date of the marriage. The grounds on which you are filing for divorce. Information about any minor children, including their names and birthdates. Information about your marital assets, debts, and any property. A statement regarding whether you are seeking spousal support (alimony). A statement regarding child custody. If applicable, you should include any Mediated Settlement Agreement. A statement that one or both of you have resided in the state for at least 60 days prior to filing. A statement regarding whether either spouse are currently on active duty in the military.You can use a basic divorce complaint form if your divorce is uncontested, you do not have minor children, you don’t own expensive property, and you lived in Arkansas for the previous 60 days. You can also review the form for the basic layout of a divorce complaint. You can locate a divorce complaint form at: http://www.arlegalservices.org/divorcepacket.  If you and your spouse already negotiated a property settlement, you should submit your signed agreement to the court, along with your divorce complaint. Since Arkansas is an equitable distribution state, if you have not reached an agreement, the court will review all of the documents and make a determinations as to a “fair” division of property, which may not mean equal division. Generally, if the parties cannot agree, the court will:   Distribute half the marital property to each party unless that would not be an equitable/fair distribution. If the court does not divide the property equally, it will consider the following factors in dividing the property: the length of the marriage; age and health of the parties; occupation of he parties; ability to get a job; job skills; amount and sources of income; contribution of each party to the marital property, including the contribution of a homemaker., Arkansas courts prefer when spouses come up with their own custody arrangement. However, if the parties cannot agree, the court will determine what is in the best interest of the child. A court may consider the child’s custody preference if they are old enough to make a well-reasoned decision, as well as the previous and future relationship the child had/will have with each parent.   In determining child support, Arkansas requires that the parent who does not have primary custody pay a percentage of his or her income for support of the child., Spousal support is decided on a case-by-case basis and not all parties seek or are given this support. The parties can agree to long-term or short-term support. If the parties disagree, the court will make a determination as to whether one of the spouses should be awarded support. In deciding on spousal support, a judge will consider:   Both spouse’s current and anticipated income, as well as earning ability. Both spouse’s resources, assets and debts. The standard of living they were accustomed to during the marriage. The length of the marriage. While there is no set calculation, Arkansas courts have ruled that 20% of the other spouse’s take home pay is an acceptable temporary spousal support amount., As discussed above, you should file your Complaint for Divorce in the Arkansas Circuit Court in the county where you have resided for at least the previous 60 days.   Check with the court clerk, but generally, you will be required to bring an original Complaint for Divorce and two copies to the clerk’s office. The court will keep the original and stamp the copies with the date and time that you filed the Complaint. You must also bring with you the appropriate filing fee. You should ask the court clerk for the specific amount of the filing fee as it varies by county. Typically, the fee is around $150., After you file the Complaint for Divorce, the court will issue a Summons for the filed case. The Summons sets forth a notice of the lawsuit and identifies your spouse’s legal rights, such as the right to hire an attorney. It also notifies your spouse that he or she must file an Answer within 30 days of being served with the Summons and Complaint., Once you receive the Summons from the court, you must provide your spouse with a copy of the Summons and Complaint; this is known as serving the other party. In Arkansas, you can serve your spouse in the following ways:   Certified Mail. If you serve your spouse in this way, you must also file an Affidavit of Service by Mail that states that you sent the Complaint via certified mail, return receipt requested, and you must attach the proof of receipt to the affidavit. You can serve your out-of-state spouse using this method.Sheriff or Constable. Process Server. A private process server is typically the quickest route to serving the Complaint but this way also costs the most money.If you are unable to locate your spouse, you must be able to show the court that you diligently attempted to locate him or her and you were still unable to find him or her. You will need to file an affidavit with the court outlining all of the steps you took to locate your spouse. Once you show the court how you unsuccessfully attempted to locate your spouse and the court grants you permission, you can “serve” your spouse by: publishing a Warning Order on a bulletin board in the courthouse or publishing the Warning Order in a newspaper of general circulation for at least two weeks. The court will instruct you as to which you must do.You can view a sample Warning Order at: https://www.arlegalservices.org/files/FSServiceByPublication.pdf.  Typically, your spouse has between 20 to 30 days to file his or her response to the Complaint, which is referred to as an Answer. In the Answer, your spouse will respond to each paragraph/allegation in your Complaint and may also raise counterclaims, which are legal assertions against. A counterclaim may include a challenge to your specified grounds for divorce.To view a sample Answer visit: http://www.arlegalservices.org/answer.  If your spouse did not file an Answer within the amount of time specified on the Summons, you can make a motion to the court requesting default judgment. A default judgment is a court ruling against your spouse and in your favor for the divorce., If your spouse did file an Answer, both parties will engage in the discovery process, which includes responding to questions, giving or taking depositions (sworn testimony under oath), and the exchange of child custody evaluations and financial information., If you and your spouse are unable to reach an agreement, a trial will be held and both parties will present evidence to an Arkansas circuit judge. The judge will evaluate all of the evidence, make decisions about the facts in the case, and ultimately issue a decision that specifies how all of the issues in the case will be resolved. This can include determinations on:   Property division. Division of debt. Child custody and support. Spousal support., It takes at least 30 days from when the Complaint is filed to have a judgment in a divorce case. It can take significantly longer if a party is contesting the divorce or if the parties cannot agree as to child support, custody or the division of property.

There are many different types of cards in the Pokémon trading card game. These are sold in sets contained in plastic packaging, boxes, promotional packs, tins, and more. Each collection contains a different percentage chance of having a rare card, so knowing how you bought your cards can help locate rare ones.   In many cases, more expensive collections of cards, like boxes and tins, have a higher chance of having rare cards. You may want to start looking for rare cards in your boxed or tinned sets.; , Cards that are marked in the bottom right corner with a circle (common) or diamond (uncommon) won't likely be worth much. Most of these cards can be safely set off to the side, but over time, even common cards can become rare.   When dealing with common cards that are also old, set these aside with other potentially rare cards, as their rarity and value may have increased. You might consider giving old Pokémon cards that aren't worth much as presents to friends or relatives.  Cards with a star (rare), holofoil picture, a star followed by a letter or symbol (which frequently indicates ultra rare, like ☆H), and secret cards have a better chance of being more valuable.   Secret cards are not officially listed as part of the collection. You can find the collection number as a fraction in the bottom right corner of the card. When the number before the slash is larger than the one following it, you have a secret card. Among rare cards, there are sometimes even rarer cards. For example, nearly all holofoil cards are rare, but there's an even rarer variety, the holofoil rare, which is indicated by a star in the lower right corner of the card. Some cards contain small printing errors that make the card especially rare. These are often worth huge sums of money. If you notice an error in your card, it might mean you have one that's particularly valuable., Promotional cards are given away as part of a special event or are included as a bonus in some packs. These were originally marked with a black star and the words "PROMO." There are also promo cards that have a gold foil star.Older cards will have a promotional symbol beneath the set symbol, which you can find under the right corner of the Pokémon picture. Newer card promo symbols are in the bottom right corner of the card. Some promo cards are given out at events, included with magazine subscriptions, or sent with similar merchandise, like the Pokémon video games. Promo cards can range greatly in value. Some are very common, while others are incredibly rare., Generally, first edition cards are rarer and worth more money, so these should be given priority when selling. You'll only find first edition cards among older ones made by Wizards of the Coast. Pokémon International does not currently print first edition cards.   You can find the symbol indicating the edition of your cards below the lower left corner of the Pokémon picture. The symbol will look like a number enclosed in a black circle with the word "Edition" above in small letters., In almost all cases, Pokémon cards will belong to a corresponding set. These sets are usually released four times a year, with each card in a set bearing the same symbol in either the bottom right corner of the card or below the bottom right corner of the Pokémon picture. Complete sets can sell for a lot of money, but older sets might be rare enough to split and sell a card at a time.   Some Generation I sets include: Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket. Some Generation II sets include: Neo Genesis, Neo Discover, and Legendary Collection. Some Generation III sets include: EX Ruby & Sapphire, EX Dragon, EX FireRed & LeafGreen, and EX Unseen Forces. Some Generation IV sets include: Diamond & Pearl, Majestic Dawn, Legends Awakens, Supreme Victors, Unleashed, and Undaunted. Some Generation V sets include: Black & White, Noble Victories, Plasma Blast, and Dragon Vault. Some Generation VI sets include: XY, Flashfire, Primal Clash, Ancient Origins, BREAKthrough, BREAKpoint, and Fates Collide., There are many different ways you might want to organize your Pokemon cards. It might seem tedious, but gathering similar cards together will help you keep track of them better. You might choose to:   Divide you cards according to rarity. This way, all the rare cards you discovered in your deck are grouped together and ready to be sold. Collect cards in sets. Since sets often sell for more, this might be a good tactic if you have many full sets of cards. It also might help you to make a list of the rare cards you have. Cards are small and can be lost easily. Having a record can help you recognize when something is missing or misplaced., This is often the best indication of rarity. However, if you have many cards, it might not be worth your time to research every single card you have. You might want to limit your research to rare or old cards, as these stand a better chance of being valuable. To research the value of your cards, you can:   Look up the same card on online sellers or auctions, like Amazon or eBay. The average selling price of your card should help you figure out its base worth. There are also Pokémon card game sites dedicated to tracking the sales of the cards. One favorite site among collectors is Pokémon Prices, which is updated hourly.Check collector catalogs. You should be able to find these online, but you might also be able to find them in your public library. These usually indicate the rarity of the card and its approximate value.  Originally, Pokémon cards were produced and sold by the company Wizards of the Coast. Now, cards are made and sold by Pokémon International. If you notice differences between old and new cards, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a fake. These cards may only be produced by different companies.   By knowing the two producers of Pokémon cards, you could save yourself from accidentally throwing away a salable card.  Cards that are in new condition or original packaging are almost always worth more money than cards with bends, tears, creases, or other disfiguring marks. Mint condition cards will have sharp, crisp edges, little wear along the edges, and its original gloss. Many card collectors categorize cards as:GEM-MT, which stands for "Gem Mint." These cards have no staining, blemishes, little to no printing imperfections, sharp corners, and a smooth surface gloss. MINT, which should have very little or no damage. These cards differ from gem mint cards in that they frequently have only one minor flaw. NM-MT means near mint to mint, and indicates a very high quality card. At a glance, these might seem perfect, but upon close inspection have one or more slight flaws. EX, also known as "Excellent" cards, will have more obvious damage. There may be rounding at the corners, light scratches, and very light creases. VG stands for "Very Good." These cards may have visible damage, but so long as the damage does not detract from the card's overall appearance, it's considered a VG card. GOOD cards should still be pleasing to the eye, but will be marred by obvious damage, like rounded corners, staining, scratches, and loss of surface gloss., It might take a while before you're able to sell your card. In the meantime, damage to it can decrease its worth. You may want to use a plastic sleeve or card protector to prevent your rare cards from losing value.Card protectors or sleeves are a must when selling your cards in person. When selling a card face to face, the buyer will likely want to inspect the card before purchasing. A protector or sleeve will prevent accidental damage. In most cases, a card protector 2.5 by 3.5 in. (64 by 89 mm) will fit your Pokémon cards. Some "jumbo" size promotional cards may require larger card protectors.  If you're too young to sell the cards online, you may find some willing buyers among your friends or fellow Pokémon card game players. You never know when the friend of a friend might be looking for the card you are trying to sell.   Many libraries, hobby shops, and schools hold weekly or monthly tabletop gaming events. This might be the perfect place for you to find someone interested in buying your rare cards., Hobby shops are more than just a place for you to buy games, more Pokémon cards, and play the Pokémon card game with your friends. At most shops, you can also sell your unwanted rare cards to the shop owner.   Common cards will be less desirable and sell for less, so it's not likely that a shop owner will want to buy anything less than a rare card. Your local hobby shop might have an announcement board on which you can advertise the card you're trying to sell. If your hobby shop has one of these, ask if you can advertise on it. Be careful when selling your cards at a hobby shop. They'll want to make the biggest profit off their purchase, so they'll try to buy your cards for as little as possible. It may help to prepare yourself to haggle over the sale of the card., Even at smaller, local Pokémon card game meet ups, like those held at hobby shops, you might stumble upon someone interested in buying your card. Larger events, like regional and national tournaments, will have even more Pokémon fans who might be interested.   You can find a complete listing of official Pokémon card game events on the trading card homepage. In the upper right corner, you should find the "Attend Events" tab, which will provide you with a list of events.Many Pokémon fans can also be found at comic, video game, and cosplay conventions. If an official Pokémon event is impossible to attend, an unofficial, similar convention could be a good place to sell.  This is one of the easiest and most visible ways of putting your card up for sale. The more people who see your card, the more likely someone who wants it will see it. However, many online sellers require you to be 18 years of age before you are allowed to use the service.   If you're too young to put your cards up for sale online on your own, you can ask for help from a parent or guardian. Common online sellers include eBay, Amazon, and several Pokémon oriented sites, like Professor-oak and the Pokémon Card Market., This will depend on your personal situation. If you have a complete set, you may find that you can make the most money by selling it all together. However, in other cases, it may be easiest and/or more profitable to sell your cards one at a time.   You could also group together related rare cards and sell them as a bundle. For example, if you have several rare psychic Pokemon, you might sell these together. If you have a large amount of common cards, you may still be able to sell these and make back some cash. You might try assembling common cards into "beginner decks" to sell.  This will be the acceptable range for which you're willing to sell the card. Choosing a price range is very useful when selling, as many buyers will want to haggle the price down. Knowing the bottom range you're willing to sell at will help prevent you from being talked into selling too low.   For example, a Lugia EX card can sell for around $26. You might decide that your acceptable selling range for this card is between $23 - $27. A selling range can also help if your card isn't selling. In this case, you might take your card off the market, then put it on the market with a price lower in your selling range. Try to keep your selling range to yourself. If buyers find out your lower limit, they may hard ball you for the lowest possible price, even if they're willing to pay your asking price., This will be a specific number in your selling range. In nearly all situations, you'll start negotiating the sale of your card with a specific asking price. This number may increase or decrease during negotiation, but it should never drop below the lower limit of your selling range.   If you find that your cards aren't selling, you may have a selling range that's too high for the current market. To improve your chances at a sale, you may want to adjust your range. The market for cards can change drastically in a very short time. If cards aren't selling, or if you only get low offers, you might only have to wait until the market picks back up., The fashion you do this will be influence by the place you've chosen to sell your cards. If you're selling cards in person at events, card protectors will keep your cards safe while traveling and handling. Online sales, in most cases, will need a picture to be included when the card is put up for sale.   If you're posting an advertisement at your local hobby shop, you can write your own short description of the card, its price, and your contact information. Print this with a picture of the card and post it. If you don't have a camera to take a picture of your card, you could use your cell phone camera, instead.  You should never give or send the cards you are selling to someone else without receiving payment first. Once the payment has been exchanged, you should give or send your card to the buyer to complete the sale. Now you can use the money for whatever you desire.	Recall how you acquired your cards.

However don't overly polish the surfaces as a slightly rough or 'keyed' surface usually leads to a stronger bond. It is crucially important in any soldering task to ensure that the pieces to be joined match up closely with the smallest gap possible.; , Pickling means immersing the pieces or covering the joint area in an acid cleaning fluid. This strips impurities, oxides and greases that can lead to poor solder flow or weak bonding.  Flux is the magic component in soldering. Applying a moderately generous amount evenly about the bond area is sufficient.  Ensure that the pieces cannot move and that heating will not cause the fixture to melt.  If possible move either the work or the materials away. If this is not possible, shield the materials with a flame proof device, like a heat shield mat. If this is not possible, then either ensure you can apply heat in a safe direction or consider another method like removing the pieces and repositioning them afterwards.  Especially in heating systems water can remain that will be drawn into the heating area. Aside from steam burning you or getting in your face, water will cool the joint and prevent soldering temperatures being reached and if they are, it will blow holes in the solder.  On a small object like a ring this is the opposite side of the ring. On a larger pipe joint like a 22mm T, the whole T and about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of pipe should be warmed evenly. This keeps heat uniformly contained in the joint area and stops hot and cold spots causing irregular flows.  This is the cut in a ring, or the centre of the body of the T.  The water base of the flux should now be completely burned off. If the flux is bubbling still, then continue heat and check again until all the flux is solidified, moving your heat source as needed to target these areas.  If the pieces are closely matched and well heated, the solder will be pulled in by thermal and surface tension forces, causing the solder to visibly flow up into the joint. This is often seen as the best way to ensure a proper bond was formed as the solder pulled itself into the void. If there is not quite enough solder applied but visually it is clear that it flowed, more can be added to the spots that look a little dry. ,,,, to finish off the perfect joint!	Cut, file, sand or otherwise flatten the joining surfaces as much as possible. Wash the pieces clean and if possible 'pickle' them. Apply an appropriate flux to the joint area. Fix the piece in a vice, clips or similar fixture. Check the area for flammable materials. Ensure there is no remnant moisture in any pipework or tanks. Heat the pieces starting moderately far from the joint. When nice and hot, apply heat to the jointing area directly. Ensure the flux has flowed and ceased bubbling. Apply the solder to the bottom of the joint. Take away your heat source.  , Inspect the joint for good bonding and a clean, smooth join.  , Cool the piece with an appropriate coolant, usually water.  , Clean the joint (inside and out) to remove excess flux residue.  , Sand, file etc.
After your model finishes with the petroleum jelly, apply a thick layer over the back of her upper thighs, her buttocks, and her lower back (or as high as you want the cast to reach).Make sure the coat of petroleum jelly is smooth and there aren't any long hairs poking out. Your model may wish to shave or trim her pubic hair before you begin, just to make sure nothing gets caught in the plaster. For extra protection, your model can use a plastic wrap to cover her her anus and labia, protecting them from the wet plaster., If one leg must be lifted slightly, use a phonebook to prop the leg up.   If you pose her in too difficult or uncomfortable a position, you may be forced to stop before the plaster has dried. Try to find a pose that fits your artistic vision and takes her comfort into consideration, too., Do not leave the bandages in the water to soak--the plaster will come off and the bandages won't stick. Slide the wet bandage between your middle and index finger to wipe off excess water. Be careful not to wipe off the plaster as well.Make sure the water is warm so it will be less shocking when you place it on your model's skin.It is quite helpful to have an assistant wetting the plaster bandages and handing them to you, as you will have to work very quickly once the process has begun. Don't let the water get too white or milky with plaster, or your bandages may separate later., This will make it less likely your cast will have holes or leaks.Use your hands to gently smooth any air bubbles out and releasing them from the sides of the bandage.Don't press too hard on the wet bandages or you may create dimples that will affect your finished mold., Instead of covering the entire area with bandages and then starting again with a second layer, you want to be covering each area with at least three layers as you move up the body. Let the different layers criss-cross and weave over each other so the cast will be tightly sealed, strong, and firm.To prevent the edges from breaking when you remove the cast, make the edges at least six layers thick., This should take no more than 10 or 15 minutes, and you can begin cleaning up while you wait.Tap the cast gently to test if it has hardened--it will sound firm and will feel dry., The cast will be difficult to remove--there will still be tiny hairs stuck in the plaster, despite the petroleum jelly.Though it feels hard, the cast is actually quite delicate, so be very careful as you lift it.Ask the model to wiggle slightly, as this may help loosen the plaster from her skin.Make sure you have a robe or clean, dry clothes for the model to put on immediately.  To avoid damaging the mold, you can place it on a soft surface, with the hollow side down.You can also tie a string around the cast and hang it from a hangar or a nail in the wall.Cover the completely dried cast with an oil-based varnish to strengthen it and prevent mold.Once dry, your plaster mold is ready for use.	Cover the skin you plan to cast with a thick layer of petroleum jelly or olive oil.Allow the model to apply the lubricant between her legs and anywhere else she might not feel comfortable with you touching.It is important to have a barrier between the skin and the bandages, as this will keep hair and skin from sticking to the plaster, making it painful to remove. Position your model on the table and provide adequate support.If the pose requires her to prop herself up on her elbows, put pillows underneath her chest so she has some support. Dip the bandages in a large bowl of warm water, one at a time. Start from the thighs and begin laying strips down one at a time, overlapping and working your way up the body.You must work as quickly and efficiently as possible, as the plaster becomes stiff in under 10 minutes and new strips will no longer adhere to the dried bandages.Lay down your strips in different directions, either alternating between horizontal and vertical, or in criss-crossing diagonals. Layer the bandages as you go. Allow the plaster to harden. Loosen the edges of the dried cast, then gently lift it off the model's body. Let the cast continue to dry.
Lay the bag flat on a table. Use a ruler to make a mark on the brown bag four inches up from the bottom of the bag., Use scissors to cut the top of the bag down to the mark you made on each of the four sides of the bag. Open the bag up to cut each of the four sides.   You should end up with the top of the bag cut into four sections.  Twist the entire bag into one big twist. This will give the tree an aged look. Untwist the bag, and open the bag up again., Twist the bottom of the bag at the mark you previously made. This should make the bag have the bottom open a bit, and be twisted tight at the mark you made., The four sections at the top of the bag will be the major branches of the tree. To create the branches, cut each of the four sections into thinner strips and twist each strip into a branch.   Take the first section and twist it halfway up starting at the base of the section. Cut the end of the first section down to the twisted section. You can make one, two, or three cuts. Twist each new section. You can twist it all the way to the end, or stop halfway and make more cuts to twist. Continue until everything is twisted into a branch. Repeat this with all four main sections. Try to make each one slightly different.  Use scissors to make four small snips around the base of the tree. Then, gently twist each section into four roots.  Stand your tree up to observe it. Make any needed tweaks to the branches to get the tree how you want it. You can cut leaves out and glue them on your tree if you’d like, but the brown bag tree looks great as is too.	Make a horizontal line around the bag. Cut down to the mark. Twist the bag. Make the trunk of the tree. Make the branches. Create the roots. Add finished touches.
Herpetology is a specialized field, so your local college may not offer the courses you need. Find out which schools offer degree programs with an emphasis on herpetology, and contact several of the colleges and universities that do. Reach out to each college to ask what types of programs they offer and to learn more about the school.   Herpetology programs are offered at several schools, from the University of Wisconsin Madison and Ohio University to the University of Florida, so do your research to find which school would be the best fit for you.; , A basic requirement for becoming a herpetologist is to have a Bachelor's Degree with a concentration in biology. Your studies should be comprehensive and focus on reptile and amphibian biology, zoology, conservation and ecology, animal physiology, and animal behavior., You should take a variety of courses, such as physics, chemistry, and earth science. Biological studies will require that you have skills in statistics and advanced mathematics courses such as calculus. Develop your writing and research skills as well if you want to publish your work in peer-reviewed, professional and academic journals., It’s important to realize that more advanced positions within the field of herpetology generally require a Master of Science in Biology or a Ph.D. in Biology. Educational requirements depend on the type of position and responsibilities and whether you choose to focus on a specialized area during your studies, but earning a graduate degree will give you an edge over the competition., It’s important to be well-versed in the field of herpetology.

The worst thing you can do is try to convince them to see a doctor when their health is in dire jeopardy. If you do this, the decision may be made hastily and may not include your relative’s best interests. Instead, start having the conversation early on.For example, a teenage relative becomes pregnant, but doesn’t trust that the doctor will respect her privacy. She may fear they will tell her partner or her parents about the pregnancy. You might want to start asking her about her prenatal care plan as soon as possible so that the baby can get proper care that the mother feels comfortable with. Similarly, try to get your aging parents regular checkups before a problem arises. That way, you will understand their wishes and be able to follow appropriate measures in the event of a serious health scare.; , Don’t back them into a corner. Cornering your loved one may make them even more resistant to help. Have an easy-going conversation with no pressure. Choose a time when you are both relaxed and able to talk without distractions. Bring the subject up casually.  For example, you might say, “Mom, when was the last time you saw a doctor?” or “Jody had to leave early to take his dad to the clinic. It made me remember that you haven’t gone in a while.”  , If your loved one isn’t open to a casual suggestion, you will need to approach the discussion head-on. Be clear and direct about your concerns, especially if their health is in a critical state.  You might say, “Mom, I can tell that your arthritis is getting worse. You didn’t even get out of bed yesterday. I love you and I am worried. I would feel so much better if you saw a doctor.” Keep in mind that you may have to repeat this step several times before your loved one truly starts to consider your suggestions.  If your loved one continues to show reluctance about seeing a doctor, you may want to probe them for more information. Figuring out where the root of their hesitation is can help you come up with a viable solution.  You might ask, “Do you not like your doctor?” or “Are you worried about something in particular?” You might also take a more straight-forward path by asking “Why don’t you want to see the doctor?”, In some cases, people may avoid seeing a doctor because they are not yet ready to accept the realities of a situation. Maybe a loved one in remission for cancer starts losing weight or re-experiencing symptoms. Perhaps an aging parent keeps forgetting things. These people may be reluctant to see the doctor because the outcome is more than they can face at the moment.In such situations, you must make your loved one consider the consequences if they don’t take actions. For instance, the cancer may return at full force if they don’t start treatment right away. Or, a parent with memory loss may carelessly hurt themselves or get lost.	Don’t wait until a crisis. Approach the subject with care. State your concerns clearly and with love. Ask questions. Discuss the consequences of denial.
If the plaintiff didn't follow legal procedures to have the complaint delivered, you can have it dismissed for improper service.   Courts have a particular procedure by which the plaintiff must deliver to you a copy of the complaint and summons so you have official notice that you are being sued. Generally, the papers must be delivered to you by a person over the age of 18 who is not a party to the lawsuit.The papers also must be delivered either to you in person or to someone who has authority to accept the lawsuit. If your company is being sued rather than you personally, the papers must be delivered to the correct person.For example, if the plaintiff is suing your company and the complaint and summons are delivered to your receptionist rather than your registered agent, you could claim improper service. If service was improper, you must make this objection in the first document you file in the case – typically your answer to the complaint. Otherwise, the court views any objection to service as waived.Keep in mind that having the plaintiff's lawsuit dismissed due to improper service doesn't usually make it go away entirely. The plaintiff typically can refile his or her lawsuit and complete service properly.; , Each state has a statute of limitations that only allows lawsuits to be filed within a certain period after the injury occurred.   You can typically find out your state's statute of limitations by doing a simple search online. Which deadline applies depends on the type of lawsuit the plaintiff has filed. If the plaintiff is filing a tort or personal injury lawsuit, he or she typically has a year or two after the injury to file suit – although some states give as much as six years.However, if the plaintiff's claim is based on a written contract, the statute of limitations generally is much longer – often as long as 10 years., Unlike statutes of limitations, statutes of repose require a plaintiff to file his or her lawsuit within a certain period of time after the product was purchased.   Not every state has a statute of repose, so you'll have to do a little research to see if there's one that applies to the plaintiff's case. In many states the statute of repose is pegged to the product's useful life. For example, in Florida the statute of repose is 12 years if the product has a useful life of 10 years or less.Other states describe their statute of repose as a rebuttable presumption of the product's useful safe life. This means the law assumes your product can be used safely for a certain period of time, usually 10 years. If the plaintiff wants to file a lawsuit for an injury that occurred after that period, he or she must prove that the product could still be used safely., If the court where the plaintiff filed suit doesn't have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim or personal jurisdiction over you, you can have the lawsuit dismissed.   If the plaintiff sued in federal court and his or her claims aren't based on a federal law, the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction unless you and the plaintiff live in different states and the damages the plaintiff claims must be in excess of $75,000.The court generally doesn't have personal jurisdiction unless the plaintiff sues in a court located in the county or judicial district where you live – or where your business is located, if your business is being sued rather than you personally.If you don't believe the court has personal jurisdiction over you, this must be raised in the first document you file – otherwise, the court will treat it as though you consent to the court's jurisdiction.Having the plaintiff's lawsuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction can buy you some time, but it won't make the lawsuit go away. Typically the plaintiff will simply file the lawsuit in a court that does have jurisdiction.	Determine whether you were served properly. Check the date when the plaintiff was injured. Find out when the plaintiff purchased your product. Analyze the court's jurisdiction.
Cut them into one to two inch (2.5 to 5 cm) strips., You can find cardboard shapes, boxes and ceramic shapes in thrift stores and craft stores., Mix together one-half cup (63g) of flour with two cups (473ml) of cold water. Boil two cups (473ml) of water in a saucepan.  Add the flour mixture to the saucepan. Bring it to a boil again. Stir in three tbsp. (37g) of sugar. Remove it from the heat and set it aside to cool. Once it is near room-temperature it is ready to use., Make sure the strip is entirely covered with paste., Smooth it down. Repeat until the entire surface of the sculpture is covered in strips of text., It will harden. Place it out to show off your text sculpture.	Cut out pages from your discarded books. Find a knick-knack or shape that you want to cover with text. Mix up a batch of papier-mache material. Dip the strips of paper into the papier-mache liquid. Wind the strip onto the ceramic or cardboard shape. Allow it to dry overnight.
You should be able to find a Ludo board game at any children’s store or bookstore that sells board games. It is more popular in Indian and Bangladeshi cultures, but there are Western versions available.   A popular Western adaptation of Ludo is the board game “Sorry!”; , There are several terms specific to Ludo and other similar games. Each player picks a color and is control of the four pieces, or pawns. Instead of using a pair of dice, Ludo only requires one die. The game begins by setting up each pawn in their corresponding pockets. Pockets are the big, color-coated squares in each corner. The home pocket is the center square that has one space of each color.   Most of the game play occurs on the track. The track consists of 52 spaces. The home run is made of four sets of five spaces. This stretch leads into the home pocket. You can only be on the home run if your pawn’s color matches the color of the home run., Ludo can be played with 2 to 4 players. Players should be over four years old or have the attention span to count and take turns. Each player chooses one of the four colors represented on the board and on the pawns., After each player chooses a color, take all of the pawns of that color and place them in the pockets of the same color.   When played with 2 people, play as the opposing colors across from each other, or in opposite corners. This would mean yellow vs red or green vs blue. Place the pawns inside the pockets that match the color of your pawns.  Determine who goes first by luck of the die. Let each player roll the die. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first. The order of play will proceed clockwise from the player who goes first.	Get a Ludo set. Understand Ludo terminology. Get a group together. Prepare the board. Decide who goes first.
Fill your kitchen sink approximately one third to halfway full with warm water and add a few drops of dish washing liquid. Using a clean sponge, gently wash your classes inside and out. Rinse thoroughly.Avoid using more than a few drops of dish soap, as excess soap can lead to streaks and residue.; , Place clean glasses on a dish mat or clean towel to dry. Position glasses downwards, with the rim on the bottom. Avoid drying your glasses with a cloth, as this can leave residue. , Using a dishwasher is a less effective way to get glasses clean and cloud-free than hand washing. If you prefer using a dishwasher anyway, there are ways to improve the results. For more fragile glasses (e.g. wine glasses), choose a delicate cycle. Leave as much room as possible between glasses to prevent clinking or scraping.To prevent residue that sometimes remains on glasses after being run through the dishwasher, add one quarter cup of white vinegar to the machine’s rinse cup.	Clean glasses by hand. Air dry the glasses. Using a dishwasher.
Allow to sit for a few minutes and then flush.; , The sulfur will cover up the odors.  A few plants around the toilet area will help to keep it fresh.  Vinegar will help to neutralize odors and also cleans the S-Bend on its way through.  There's a lot to be said for an influx of fresh air.	Add drops of your favorite essential oil to the water. Light a match over a very smelly loo and drop it in the water. Add plants to the bathroom. Flush vinegar down the bend. Open the window.
What you must always remember is that people who owe money are not necessary bad people; they are usually in debt for a reason such as:   Fallen on hard times Not happy with product or service so refuse to pay Unaware of payment terms Have moved addresses and not told the company or people they owe money too; ,,,, It may seem strange at the time but if you have to trace somebody then these are the pieces of information that will lead you to the person. If you are working for a company it is worth doing a company credit check, this will reveal   Company accounts – Are they making any money? Directors names – Is the person who placed the order a director? County court judgements – did they pay their other suppliers? Directors dates of birth and addresses Company telephone number  , It is also worth pointing out that if you are offering credit terms you need a consumer credit license to cover you in the event that you are not paid.  So spread the calls out, you can telephone somebody up to three times a day and leave three messages, I think that it is more professional to leave only one, you do not want to harass anybody. If after calling you have still received no response you must contact the debtor by post and email, I would recommend sending a basic letter to them, explaining the current situation, if after a week you have still not had a response send another letter but be firmer this time, explaining the action that will be taken if the debt is not paid by a particular date. The third letter should be worded stronger still, explain in clear detail the action that will result in the letter not being responded to, this could be   A debt collection agency will be used A solicitor will be used Costs and interest will be added to the account  , The simplest way to do this is to contact a neighbour of the debtor and ask them, it must be said that discretion must be used, do not tell the neighbour anything about the debtor just simply ask if the person still lives next door, if they demand to know who you are simply state that you have some correspondence that you need to get to them, if they press you further thank them for their time and end the call. Remember to withhold your number though! Its 141 if you don’t know.  You could use an online solicitor to send a “letter before action” again this is an idle threat but since it on headed paper from a solicitor it carries more weight, note that the solicitor will want at least £5 for doing this and will not follow up the action but this is a tried and tested technique and does have good results.  Everyone shows at their address, what I mean by this is that when you do normal everyday things like fill in your address on a form you leave a trail back to your address. Some people say that they don’t but everybody does, information is collected by everyone these days and if you read the terms and conditions of most large organisations they do say that they will pass information about you to other large organisations, this takes time so for three months none of the systems will be showing the new address and you will need to do something other than system based trace work. The only method now is to get on the phone and start calling other people, you can try neighbours who might know the debtors whereabouts, again remember not to start discussing any issues you have with the debtor with their neighbours as this could land you in serious trouble. You can also try people who live locally with the same surname, hoping that they will be relatives who will be able to help you in your location enquiry. To do this try BT.com, you can search an area and surname to get useful telephone numbers.  at the start of any business relationship. When getting people to fill out any order form as them for all the information you need then, at that moment the balance of power is with you, they want something from you so you can use this to your advantage, if they pay you can destroy the information, if they don’t you have it to hand. It is also worth doing because the serial debtors and there are lots of them about, will not be happy leaving so much information with someone whom they intend to con, they will leave sections of the order form blank and suggest that they don’t need to fill in their address as you can contact them on the telephone, be wary of these people.  Remember to always work with ethics and integrity.	Tracing debtors can be a difficult task. When trying to trace a debtor it is best if you can look into the person’s financial history and see if you can pinpoint something that can lead you to believe one of the above reasons is true, for example   The person was a regular payer until a particular date The person has never paid any of the money owed  , Now you should have a vague idea as to the reason for none payment and you can tailor your actions accordingly.  , The first thing to do is to speak directly to the debtor, for this you will need to have been smart at the start of the business relationship, time after time firms carry out hundreds if not thousands of pounds worth of work for a client or customer without having all the customers contact details, if you are dealing with an individual or sole trader you need to make sure you have   Home address/work address Home telephone number Mobile number Valid email address  , These are the minimum requirements; you should also try for partners name and date of birth. Once you have all this information you need to check it, try different numbers to contact your customer so in the event of them not paying you can get in touch with them quickly and resolve any matters before they escalate. When calling a debtor make sure you try at different times of the day, if you only call at one particular time and receive no answer then this could simply be because the debtor is working at that particular time. If you still receive no response it is worth following up on one of the above actions but if you wish to persist then the next step is to confirm that they are still at the address. Assuming that the debtor is still residing at the address it is time to follow up the threats with some action, you need to instruct a debt collection agency or solicitor to collect the debt on your behalf because you have run out of other legal options. If the debtor has moved it can become very difficult especially if they have moved within the last three months, this is because it takes around this amount of time for the debtor to start showing at the new address. The best piece of advice is to collect as much information about the person when they are prepared to give you it i.e. Finally good luck with any trace and collect work you undertake.
Every time you voluntarily lay money on the table in poker, you should have a very good reason to do so. If you are not sure you should be betting, you need to take a moment and consider what your bet represents. No matter what cards you have, the cards your opponents have are much more important. If you never see your own cards, but you could see the hand of your opponent, you would be very wealthy. Thus, your bet is made to represent the image of your hand you wish to portray.; , The basic consideration in betting before the flop in Texas Hold'em is based on the strength of your hole cards.   Do you have a speculative hand? Then you are probably betting to get to the flop inexpensively while keeping several players in the pot. If you have a strong wired pair, especially Jacks or better, you should be betting to thin the field. Your pair will stand up against a single lesser hand at a very high rate, so you want to take only one opponent (or possibly two) to the flop with you.  Place a very high bet in a way to make it more difficult or less likely for others to move to the flop, thereby cutting down the competition. Place a bet with a wrong hand without a scope to just confuse your opponent in regard to the quality of the hand they hold and to cut down competition.  Primarily, in a game where you happen to be a dealer and there is only the dealer and the blinds remaining to play, competing to steal such a pot is called blind stealing. With this game being positional, if you are a dealer you would be the last to act and you can take the pot of the blinds fold. A raise is going to make the blinds fold if they are in a medium position; however, if you are going to call, they may just check to see what comes up next. If you are in a dealer position and have a strong hand you can bet high and re-raise, contributing to some increase in the stakes. However, this is not a big way to get rich.  When you are having a good hand to play in a short-handed game, your focus against your opponent should be to limit their pot odds towards what they are trying to draw. Maybe they are targeting a straight or flush and you have a better hand than them, but if they are going to make it your hand may get beaten, in such cases you need to bet strong attempting to scare your opponents into folding.

A deposition is a formal discovery tool used by lawyers during the pretrial stage of litigation. At this point in the litigation, the other party's lawyer is trying to learn about the case and determine what helpful information you may have. For example, if your spouse has filed for divorce, their lawyer will want you to take a deposition so they can ask you about your finances, possible indiscretions, and your handling of any children. If you are asked to give a deposition, you need to consult with your lawyer about the process.   In California, divorce depositions can last up to seven hours. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. In every state, depositions are given under oath, which means if you lie you can be charged with perjury.; , You need to be an expert about the case you are being deposed on. A deposition is a lot like giving formal testimony in court. If you are not prepared and do not know the facts of your case, your deposition will not go well and you may get yourself into trouble. Luckily, these problems are easily avoided by preparing with your lawyer. Sit down and study your case and the circumstances surrounding it. If you are unsure about anything, do your best to find the answer.   For example, if you are being deposed in an alimony case, you should know everything about your financial situation, including how much money you make, where your assets are held, and how much debt you have. If you are unsure about the amount of debt you hold, call your banks and financial planners to get the answer.  If you understand the law surrounding your case, you will be in a good position to answer deposition questions effectively. For example, if the other party's lawyer asks you how much money you make, you will want to know that they are asking you so they can determine how much alimony your ex-spouse can get. Under alimony law, you would only be required to pay alimony if you can afford it.The more you know about your case the better off you will be in your deposition. Being prepared will give you the best chance of success.  While you prepare for your family law deposition, ask your lawyer what types of questions you will be asked. A good lawyer will have been in many depositions and should have a good idea of what tactics will be used. As a deponent (i.e., the person answering questions in a deposition), you should look out for the following tactics, which are used to try and trip you up and throw you off your game:The lawyer's distortion of facts to try and catch you in a lie A discussion of known contradictions in the evidence The lawyer's use of loaded terminology and leading questions The lawyer's demeanor, which will change based on how they want you to answer the question  , After studying extensively to prepare for your deposition, take some time to answer questions that will likely come up from opposing counsel. This will give your lawyer a chance to give you feedback and work on structuring your answers properly. When you sit down for a practice session, your lawyer should have some anticipated questions ready for you.   Ask your lawyer to help you identify common questions and the role they play in the litigation. Identify reminders, key phrases, and documents you can use to help alleviate stress while you are in your deposition.For example, in a divorce case, opposing counsel might ask about your finances. If you are prepared, your lawyer may tell you to simply refer to financial documents that opposing counsel should already have. In this scenario your answer might be: "I do not remember what my exact salary was the past five years. However, I believe you have my tax returns that you can look at."  , On the day of your deposition, dress comfortably but professionally. As you know, divorce depositions can last around seven hours, if not longer. While it is important to be comfortable so you can stay focused on the questions being asked, you also need to look appropriate. This is particularly the case when your deposition is being videotaped.Your appearance will go a long way towards helping your credibility. The more professional you look, the more seriously opposing counsel will take you. Dressing professionally will also tell opposing counsel that you will present yourself this way in front of a judge and jury. Wear business attire if possible. A long skirt with a button-up shirt and jacket would be good. You could also wear a suit. While a tie might not be necessary, if you feel comfortable in one you should wear it.  Deposition answers must be given verbally, which means you will not be able to shake your head or use hand gestures. When you speak at a deposition, be clear, concise, and accurate. Try to avoid using the words "um" or "uh-huh".These phrases make it seem as if you are unsure of yourself and your answers. Speak audibly and slowly so your answers can be clearly understood.For example, if you are asked what time it is, answer with, "It is three o'clock". Do not answer by saying, "Um, I believe it is about three o'clock". In another example, assume you are asked whether you had an affair with your spouse. If you did not have an affair, simply say "no". Avoid shaking your head and answering, "uh-nuh".  Do not engage with the other party's lawyer by objecting to questions or arguing. You should try to be yourself during the deposition, but do not make jokes or act sarcastically.Do not get angry or lash out at opposing counsel. The other party's lawyer will be watching at all times to see how you react to different situations. In some cases, the lawyer may even try to make you mad. In these scenarios, answer the questions to the best of your ability and move on.   In addition to acting professionally during the deposition, make sure you maintain that appearance both before and after the deposition. Lawyers will watch your every move to see what effect you may have on a jury. Above all, do not speak with opposing counsel at any time off the record., When the deposition begins, you will be required to take an oath to tell the truth. The oath you take during your deposition is the same oath you would take if you were testifying at trial. When you take this oath, you will be testifying under penalty of perjury, which means if you lie you can be convicted of perjury., The fist few minutes of a deposition will be filled with background questions that every lawyer asks. Each question has a specific purpose. While these questions and statements may seem silly, they are important to listen to. The initial questions you will be required to answer will usually be preceded by a statement. Each statement will be followed by the question, "Do you understand?" These statements are usually presented to you for the following reasons:To help you understand what a deposition is To make sure you know how you have to answer questions To make sure you are not under the influence of anything that may hinder your ability to answer questions To try and get you to give what the other lawyer thinks are complete answers  , You have an unlimited amount of time to answer deposition questions. When each question is asked, take a moment to digest the question to make sure you understand it. Think about what is being asked so you can answer accurately.Most deponents get in trouble when they start speaking immediately after a question is asked. When you do this, you are more likely to give out to much information and information that is not relevant.  After listening to the question, take a moment to think about your answer.Make sure you have a good idea of what you want to say. Doing this will help your answers be clear, concise, and accurate.   For example, assume opposing counsel asks, "What real estate do you own and what is the value of that real estate?" After the question is asked, take a moment to think about the real estate you own. In addition, think about whether you know the value of that real estate. In all likelihood, you will recognize that you can name your real estate holdings but you cannot value all of it accurately. In this scenario, you might formulate the following answer in your head: "I own two homes in Kansas and one condo in California. However, I am unsure of the value of that real estate".  Your answers should only address the particular question that was asked of you. You never want to provide more information than necessary. The more information you give, the more information opposing counsel will have to use against you. Stop talking as soon as your answer is complete. Avoid embellishing and exaggerating. Opposing counsel will usually allow for a "pregnant pause" after you answer, which is meant to try and get you to talk more. Do not fall for their tricks.   The best answers are short and simple. For example, effective answers might look like: "Yes", "No", "Two o-clock", "In my office", "I don't understand", and "I don't remember"., "I don't know" and "I don't remember" are always acceptable answers. If you do not know the answer to a question, tell the lawyer that. A lot of times, when you tell a lawyer you do not know, they will try to ask the question a different way to see if you might give a different answer. Be aware of this tactic and stick with your answer.   If you are asked the same question again, tell the lawyer" "As I said before..." and then answer in the same way you did before., Leading questions are questions the indicate the answer within them. For example, "Isn't it true that you cheated on your spouse?" is a leading question because it assumes the answer. These questions are asked to try and get you to answer a certain way. When you hear a leading question, give your lawyer a chance to object (if necessary) and make sure you answer carefully. Common leading questions usually start with:"Isn't it true that..." "Would it be fair to say that..." "Am I correct in understanding that..."  , Opposing counsel will use other questioning tactics to try and trip you up. If you identify a tricky question, make sure you allow yourself enough time to formulate a good answer. Common tricks include the use of:Compound questions Questions that assume facts Questions that call for speculation  , Never answer a question without first fully understanding it. Doing so could give opposing counsel information they did not ask for. If you do not understand a question, ask for clarification and never feel pressured to answer before an acceptable clarification is given., Under the law, your lawyer will be limited in how much they can interact with you and other lawyers during the deposition. Therefore, you should not expect your lawyer to intervene all the time. However, your lawyer may instruct you not to answer certain questions and they may make objections. Your lawyer will also have to be careful not to use "coaching" objections, which are objections used to help you answer the questions.   During your deposition, allow time for your lawyer to act before you answer questions. If your lawyer does not look as though they are going to make any comment, you should answer the question. If an objection is offered, listen carefully as your lawyer's objection may help you answer the question., Depositions can be long and tedious. If you feel like you need a break, do not be afraid to ask for one. If you are tired, hungry, or you have to go to the bathroom, it may affect your answers. In most cases, you will be afforded a break about once every couple of hours.For example, if you really have to go to the bathroom and you don't ask for a break, you may rush your answers and speak without thinking. Instead of doing this, simply tell opposing counsel, "I need a moment to go to the restroom. Would that be alright?".	Talk with your lawyer. Study the facts of your case. Review the legal disputes in your family law case. Discuss common tactics with your lawyer. Practice answering questions with your lawyer. Dress appropriately on the day of your deposition. Speak confidently. Avoid improper conduct. Take the oath to tell the truth seriously. Expect routine questions to start. Listen to each question carefully. Formulate an answer in your head before speaking. Answer only the question asked. Refrain from guessing. Identify leading questions. Be ready for other tricky questions. Ask for clarification when necessary. Look for signals from your lawyer. Ask for a break when you need one.
