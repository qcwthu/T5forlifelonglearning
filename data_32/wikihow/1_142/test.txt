Measure and cut three 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) long pieces of 22-gauge wire. Measure and cut a 50-inch (127-centimeter) long piece of 26-gauge wire. You can use any color of wire you want, but black or silver would look best for this project., Hold the three short wires together and find the middle. Place the long wire behind them, a with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long tail sticking out from beneath. Wrap the long wire four times around the bundle., If the stub that's left on the bundle is sharp, carefully press it down using a pair of needle nose pliers. Do not cut off the rest of the long wire.  Take the three 22-gauge wires, and spread them out evenly to form a star or "*" shape. They may slip and slide through the wrapped wire, so make sure that they are all the same length.  Once the spokes are the way you want them, weave the long wire over and under them, like making a basket. Keep doing this until you are back where you started, then repeat for a second round.Push the long wire down into the crevices every so often. Keep the long wire pulled nice and taut.  Bring the long wire under the next spoke and pull it taut. Bring it up, over, and around the spoke. Give it a gentle tug, and push the wrapped part down. Move onto the next spoke.  Keep the spokes nice and straight, and the long wire pulled taut. Remember to push the wrapped "knots" down to the previous one. If the web starts to warp, pinch it between your thumb and fore finger., When the wire is too short to reach the next spoke, you are done weaving. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to wrap it tightly around the current spoke three times., Use you pair of flush wire cutters for this. You will have long spokes sticking out all around the web. Don't cut these off just yet.  Squeeze a pair of wire looping pliers over the last spoke you wrapped, close to the "knot." Pull the tail-end of the spoke down behind the looping wires, towards the center of the web.If you can't find any wire looping pliers, you will need to trim the spokes down, and wrap them using a pair of round nose plies.  Bring the tail-end of the loop towards you, then wrap it around the "neck" of the loop. Trim the tail-end off. If you need to, use your needle nose pliers to tuck in any sharp ends. Remove the wire looping pliers when you are done.This wrapped loop will be the top of your earring or pendant.  Use a pair of needle nose pliers to open up an earring hook. Slide the two ends past each other, not away. Slip the loop onto the hook, then close the hook by pushing the ends back towards each other.   If you wish to make a pendant, use a large jump ring instead. Slip the jump ring onto a plain necklace.  You do not have to wrap the tail-end around the neck of each loop this time. Simply, make the loop, close it, and trim off the tail., Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop on the bottom of your earring. Slip a spider charm onto it, then twist the loop back shut.Some charms have big, clunky jump rings. If your charm has one, you might want to remove it first. This will make your earrings look nicer.  You can have the second earring match the first one, or you can make it a little different. For example, you can use a different spider charm, or you can skip it altogether.	Measure and cut your wire with a pair of flush wire cutters. Wrap the end of the long wire around middle of the three short wires. Trim off the tail-end of the long wire with a pair of flush wire cutters. Spread the spokes out evenly. Weave the long wire around the spokes for two rounds. Start wrapping the long wire around each spoke. Continue wrapping the long wire around each spoke until you run out. Wrap the tail-end of the long wire around the spoke. Trim off the tail-end. Loop the end of the last spoke. Wrap and trim tail-end of the loop. Add an earring hook to the loop. Loop the other spokes. Consider adding a spider charm. Use these steps to make a second earring.
Although the acidity from vinegar helps to eat through grease and other clogs, salt alone will scour the inside of the pipe, since it is so coarse and abrasive. Measure a 1/2 cup of salt. Then pour it directly down the drain., Boil 2 liters of water first. Pour this slowly down the drain. Aim the water directly into the drain to avoid scalding yourself with any splash-back. Once the boiled water has gone, run hot water from the tap to further flush the drain., Since you are only using salt, you will probably need to do this a few times to remove the clog. Continue to add salt in 1/2-cup increments, flushing with boiling water each time, before adding more.Avoid dumping too much in at one time.	Pour salt down the drain. Rinse the drain with boiling water. Repeat.
,   The largest (#1) gong should be at the far left, then the next largest gong, then the next, etc., until the smallest gong (#8) is at the end, at the far right.    Note that the widest part of the gong is at the top edge, not at the base of the gong, so the space between the bases of two adjacent gongs will be more than one inch wide.    Measure from the outside edge of the #1 (largest) gong to the other side of the #8 (smallest) gong. Typically, the length will be approximately 4 to 5 feet (approximately 1.2 to 1.5 meters). Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside lengthwise dimension (Measurement "L") for the antangan.    Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside width (Measurement "W") for the antangan.  #*There is no standard size for kulintang gongs, nor is there a standard size of wood for the antangan.   You will need two long pieces, and two short pieces. Feel free to use recycled wood.    The width should be about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm). The height should be about 8 inches (20.3 cm).    The width should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm). The other dimension should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm), as the end pieces of the antangan will also serve as legs. When the kulintang gongs are placed on the antangan, the kulintang should be easily played by a person sitting on a standard-size stool or armless-chair.	You will need to take careful measurements with the set of gongs in order to determine the exact sizes of wood you will need to make the stand.  , Lay the gongs in a straight line on a padded level surface, such as a carpeted floor, or a towel on a tabletop. There should be about a one inch space between each gong, as they sit in a straight row. Once the gongs are placed in row with about one inch space between each gong, measure the length of the set of kulintang gongs. Measure the diameter of the #1 (largest) gong. You may use any type of sturdy wood for the basic antangan frame. The two long pieces should each have a length equal to Measurement "L" plus an additional two inches. The two short pieces should have one dimension equal to Measurement "W".
Take some time and check in with yourself about how you feel when he pays for everything. There is a chance that if you're reading this article, you might be uncomfortable with it for one reason or another. Know that there is no right or wrong way, only how you feel about it.Ask yourself why you are okay with it or why you are not.   Do you like feeling pampered or spoiled by him? Are you concerned that he's paying for everything when he doesn't have the money to do so? Do you worry he feels obliged or obligated for some reason? Does it bother you when he refuses to let you pay for something, or even split the cost in half? Does he offer to pay because he thinks that you cannot afford to pay? Do feel obligated to him or like you have to acquiesce to his requests because he pays? This can include any impacts to your physical relationship or the control of the relationship. Do you think he pays to show off?; , Think about where you are in the relationship and why he might be doing this. Have you just started dating? Or are you just “seeing each other” and haven't made it exclusive yet? If so, he may be paying for everything to impress you or because everything is new.Maybe you two just have different attitudes towards money.If you have been dating for awhile and he's always paid, maybe he feels like he has to keep paying or maybe it's time to revisit how you manage finances as a couple., It may be something that is really important to him or he may feel like he has to, to impress you. Money can be a sensitive topic so make sure it's a conversation you have carefully and calmly.Open the topic. ”Hey, I've noticed when we go out, you always pay. Don't get me wrong, I love being spoiled by you! I was just wondering if that's something you like doing or something you feel like you have to do.” If you are afraid you are missing out on certain dates or trips because he doesn't have enough money to pay for both of you, and doesn't want you to pay anything, let him know. “I just don't want us to miss out on things because you feel like you have to pay all the time. I can pay sometimes too.”  , Maybe you have just started out dating each other, or maybe he set up an expectation he feels like he needs to uphold. He may feel like he has to pay for everything to impress you or continue to impress you. Let him know that is not the case, or remind him of it periodically.   “You know I care about you, whether you take me out or whether we are just at home. "Just so you know, I'm impressed by you not your money.” Tell him other things that impress you about him that do not include him paying for things.  If your boyfriend paying for everything bothers you, let him know. It is important to keep open and honest communication in your relationship. Try and pick a time where you are both calm to talk about it. Avoid attacking him or appearing to blame him, but rather explain your side of things. Use "I" or "me" statements to keep the focus on how you are feeling, and have the goal be finding a solution.“I feel like maybe you think I can't take care of myself, or take care of you.” "I'd really like to pay for myself once and awhile. It's important to me." "It makes me feel like things are not equal between you and me. How can we fix that?"	Evaluate how you feel. Consider where your relationship is. Talk to him to find out why he always pays.The one real way you can truly understand why he might be paying for everything and how he feels about it, is to ask him. Remind him he does not have to pay for everything just to impress you. Tell him if you don't like it.
To keep the color of most hydrangeas, it's best to start the drying process when the flowers first bloom. Cut or buy fresh, recently opened hydrangeas on the morning you plan to start the drying process.  Pee Gee Hydrangeas however, look better when left to mature. Take these at different times of the season. They start out a pale green, then as they mature, some pink shows up, later turning to burgundy, and finally a chocolate brown color very late in late fall.	Select hydrangeas to dry.
For this idea, you can use a variety of sizes. If you have a wide variety of small and large photos, hang the smaller ones at eye level and the larger ones higher up. This way, the viewer will be able to see each image equally well. Feel free to mix up eras, as well. Place antique black-and-white or sepia photos with color photos from no more than 20 years ago., A black-and-white aerial view of streets and parks will give your home a more vintage feel. Hang an engraving or lithograph in a black frame or opt for an unframed canvas. Display it in your foyer to greet guests or in your dining room as a conversation piece., Black-and-white depictions of everyday life are versatile. You can hang them in multiple rooms. If you desire a change of décor, you can switch them out to different rooms. For example, that country scene hanging in the bedroom might look equally nice in the living room., Don't fret if you can't afford that Impressionist masterpiece in the latest auction catalogue. There are plenty of websites and catalogues that sell framed oil and acrylic reproductions on canvas for reasonable prices. Hang them in the foyer, the living room, the bedroom or along the staircase., The subject matter of posters is often more modern than other forms of vintage art. Examples include old movies, propaganda form each World War, and psychedelic imagery from the 1960s and 70s. Hang them in the living room, bedroom, or dinging room. If you have a room designated for entertainment, classic movie posters would add a great touch., Spice up a white or beige mantle with a brightly colored vase. If your mantle has a bolder paint job, use a white vase for some contrast. Place a bouquet of real or artificial flowers in the vase or leave it empty. Set in the center to offset a rectangular work of wall art., Place it in the front yard to greet guests or add an accent to the back garden. Go for a simple circular dial on a rectangular pedestal or a more ornate armillary sphere. Choose from stone, metal, or a combination of the two. No matter which shapes or materials you choose, your sundial will definitely draw everyone's attention.	Adorn the staircase with framed family photos. Display an antique city map. Hang monochromatic engravings. Display oil or acrylic reproductions. Decorate with vintage posters. Place an antique vase on a fireplace mantle. Display a sundial outside.
Examples would be nineteen stitches (16 + 3) or 35 stitches (32 +3). The latter would be a good amount for a scarf with worsted weight yarn.; , The number that follows designates how many of that stitch to do. So "P4" means, "purl four stitches." It's that easy!  , Row two: K4, P3,*K5,P3. Repeat from * to the end of the row, end with K4. Row three: P4,K3,*P5,K3. Repeat from * to the end of the row, end with P4. Row four: K4, P3,*K5,P3. Repeat from * to the end of row, end with K4. Row five: Knit across. Row six: P3,* K5, P3. Repeat from * to the end of the row. Row seven: K3,* P5, K3. Repeat from * to the end of the row. Row eight: P3,*K5,P3. Repeat from * to the end of the row.  You should end up with a a fabric that looks like interwoven strands of cloth.	Cast on a multiple of 8 plus 3 stitches. Understand that "K" stands for "knit" in this pattern and "P" stands for purl. Follow the pattern:   Row 1: Knit all stitches of the first row. Repeat these eight rows of the pattern until your piece is the desired length. Cast off.
Rioters look in windows for high-price items to loot. If you have a big TV and entertainment center right in front of your picture window, your house becomes a target. Move these items out of sight or hang some thick curtains.If people can’t see what you have, that may be enough to make them keep walking past your house.  Since glass is so fragile, windows are the primary place for looters to enter your house. Attaching stickable security film to your windows keeps them from completely shattering if they are hit. Anything that slows rioters down is a good defense.The strong adhesive holds onto the glass shards, which makes it harder to climb in your windows.  You may want to keep some security features on hand without actually installing them right away. Get plywood boards and cut them to fit all of your easily accessible windows. Keep them on hand for extreme situations.Store them in the shed so you can get to them and hang them up if you see unrest starting to build. Keep a box of nails and a hammer close by the boards. Keep in mind that nailing wood to your house may damage the siding. You have to weigh the pros and cons of that type of security feature.	Move expensive items away from the windows. Stick security film to your windows. Keep precut sheets of wood ready to attach to the windows.
If you cannot produce pay stubs, your lender may ask for copies of tax returns. Be prepared to produce tax returns for at least the past two years. Since your tax returns report all of your taxable income, they may serve as an adequate proof of income for your loan.Also, your tax returns for the past two years can provide a reasonable estimate for how much you will make in the current year. Finally, lenders trust that information provided on a tax return is accurate.Lenders look at gross income, not taxable income, so don't worry if your deductions cause your income to appear lower. The inability to produce tax returns makes you seem like a higher credit risk.; , Another method of proving your income is to provide bank statements. If your income varies from month to month because of freelance work, a lender may ask for several months’ worth of statements. These will provide your lender with records of all of your deposits, allowing them to see that you do have income. However, bank statements do not give information about how you earned your income. If you have bank statements but cannot also provide tax returns, expect to pay a higher interest rate. , List all of the invoices you have made for at least the past 12 months. Also, provide details about work for which you have been contracted but haven’t invoiced yet. This information will provide proof of past income and allow a lender to predict future income. Invoices and contracts provide more detail about your sources of income. However, don’t expect lenders to rely on these alone. Invoices and contracts should only be used as a supplement to tax returns and bank statements., If you own your home, a mortgage statement may be used to prove residence. Bring the most recent statement. This will demonstrate that you still reside at this address. The mortgage statement must have your name on it. If the mortgage is not in your name, then the statement will not have your name on it., If you rent, a cancelled rent check can prove where you live. Your landlord must sign a receipt verifying that you live at this address. If you live with relatives and pay rent to them, ask them to sign a statement that you live with them at this address. In this case, you might also be asked to produce mail, such as a bill, addressed to you at this address., Lenders will usually accept a utility bill in your name as proof of your address. Be prepared to provide more than one utility bill. For example, you can provide an electric bill, water bill, sewer bill or phone bill if you have a land line. Be sure that the utility bill has your name on it. If all of your bills are in someone else’s name, such as a spouse or roommate, you will need to provide other forms of business mail in your name at that address., Other business mail includes bank statements, credit statements or other household bills besides utilities. The mail must be addressed to you at your address. Don’t use junk mail. Since junk mail is not specifically addressed to you, it would not suffice as proof of residence., A library card application requires proof of residence. So, it can also be used to verify that you reside at your stated address. Some lenders may accept this as proof of your address. However, be prepared to bring additional documents, such as bills or other business mail., Lenders will evaluate your credit score during the loan approval process. If you do not have a proof of income, prepare several months ahead of time to improve your credit score. This will increase the likelihood of getting approved for an auto loan.Pay all of your bills on time. Pay off as much debt as possible. Get a short-term loan for a small amount of money from your bank or credit union to establish good credit. Instead of taking the cash, put the money in an interest-bearing account. Pay off the loan from the account where you parked the money. Get a secured credit card. Ask to be an authorized user on another person’s credit card account, such as your spouse or a parent. Open a store credit card. Dispute inaccurate or negative information on your credit report.  Create a budget and work out a repayment plan to your creditors. You can find legitimate credit counseling programs at many universities, military bases, credit unions, housing authorities and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extension Service. Do not work with companies that promise to erase your bad credit or create a new credit identity. These are likely a scam. Avoid subprime loans. These are often marketing to people with less-than-stellar credit, but the terms are usually unfavorable. Auto loans are easier to get than mortgages because they involve less money over a shorter period of time. Shop around, because you may qualify for a better loan than you think.  Many car buyers put down approximately 10 percent of the car’s value as a down payment. However, without proof of income, you may be required to make a bigger down payment. Save up as much cash as possible ahead of time to use as your down payment. A bigger down payment not only reduces the amount you have to finance, but it also reassures lenders that you won’t be “upside down” on your loan.Lenders don’t want this to happen, so they’re more likely to approve you for a loan if you have a large down payment.   If you are trading in your old car, this can be applied towards your down payment. Provide documentation about the source of your down payment.  If someone is willing to cosign your auto loan, your lender may be more willing to approve it. A cosigner guarantees that you will make all of your payments in full and on time. Also, if you fail to pay, the cosigner agrees to make the payments for you. Your cosigner will need to have a good or excellent credit score. Also, the cosigner will need to provide proof of income and demonstrate stability in their residence and employment.Your cosigner is at risk for payment, so a default can destroy relationship.  Your dealer may try to convince you that you won’t qualify for a bank loan because you don’t have sufficient proof of income. Don’t fall for this. The dealer may be misleading you in order to get you to work with their financing. Dealer financing often comes with higher interest rates, which can mean a bigger monthly payment. Or, they may stretch the loan out for 72 months or more in order to make the monthly payment lower. In this case, you could still be paying off the loan after you no longer own the car., If you are a member of a credit union, check with them first about getting an auto loan. Credit unions are member- and community-oriented. They offer a user-friendly loan process and competitive interest rates.If you already have a relationship with a local bank, visit a branch and meet with a someone in person. Since they already do business with you, they will be familiar with your financial history and be more willing to work with you., Predatory lenders employ unfair or fraudulent practices. If you cannot provide proof of income, these loans might seem attractive because they are easy to get. However, these loans come with very high interest rates and expensive fees and charges. It’s not always simple to recognize a predatory loan. Be on the lookout for the following red flags.If you are encouraged to put false information on the loan, it’s likely a predatory loan. If add-on packages come with the loan, such as insurance, theft deterrents or rust-proofing, don’t take the loan. These packages don’t add value and simply inflate the loan amount. Ads that promise you can get a loan even with bad credit. These loans come with exorbitantly high interest rates.  If you do decide to go with dealer financing, never leave the dealership without a signed contract. Some dealers will allow you to take ownership of the car before the loan process is completed. Then, a few weeks later you get a phone call saying you didn’t qualify for the loan and must accept a different loan with a higher interest rate.This is a scam. The dealer can adequately assess your credit worthiness and approve you for a loan on the spot. If they are not willing to complete the loan process with you, then go elsewhere.	Provide tax returns. Produce bank statements. Generate a report of invoices and contracts. Bring your most recent mortgage statement. Provide cancelled rent checks. Produce utility bills. Show other business mail. Present a library card application. Repair bad credit. Put down a healthy down payment. Get a cosigner. Be wary of dealer financing. Seek out local banks and credit unions. Avoid predatory lenders. Thoroughly examine all dealer financing paperwork.
Make sure you’ve removed the label and entire contents of the bottle before cutting bottle.   Identify the center of the bottle before cutting.       Suit up with protective eyewear and gloves before cutting.       Cut the bottle down the middle, taking care to make a clean, straight cut.       Sand the cut edges (gently) with the sandpaper. Make sure you sand inside the cut edges as well so you don’t cut your hand during the planting step.      ; , Make sure the liner blocks the neck portion of the bottle so water will remain inside the bottle instead of leaking out of the top., Pour soil loosely to make room for planting the vegetation.  Using your shovel, make room for the plants inside your wine bottle centerpiece. Strategically place plants in an eye pleasing design and one that will hold up well without being propped up.  While this is optional, the rocks will help seal moisture in your centerpiece, keeping your plants healthy.  To add interest, add several drops of glue to the side of the wine bottle and then hold the other wine bottle half in place.   Hold bottle in place until it adheres to the planter. This could take several minutes.	Cut clean wine bottle in half. Cut plastic liner to fit the inside of one-half of the bottle. Add potting soil to ¾ of the bottle. Plant flowers/vegetation. Sprinkle centerpiece ground with decorative rocks. Glue the other half of the wine bottle to the side of the planter wine bottle.
Look for an herbicide approved for aquatic use that includes one of the following active ingredients: glyphosate, imazamox, imazapyra or diquat. These chemicals are effective on cattails.  These measurements are needed for you to determine how much herbicide you should use to kill your cattails.   Get the measurements for your pond. If a contractor put in the pond, you should be able to get the measurements from the contractor's office. Your local survey control service office may also have measurements available or aerial photos you can use to determine your pond's measurements. If not, get a survey of the pond or measure it yourself. Methods you can employ yourself without special equipment include chaining and pacing. Chaining involves putting a stake at either end of a measuring tape or length of wood, chain, or rope of known length. Place the stakes in the ground, remove them, and stick them back in the ground, this time, with the first stake in the same place where the second stake left a depression. Continue moving the measuring tape and stakes around the perimeter of the pond. Count the number of times you need to move the stake, and multiply this number by the length of the measuring tape to get the perimeter's measurement. Pacing functions in the same way, but the known length is your normal stride. Calculate area. Determine the shape of your pond, whether it's roughly square, circular or triangular, and use the appropriate formula to solve for area. Calculate volume. The volume of a pond is the area multiplied by the average depth of the pond. Take depth measurements by slowly dropping a weighted line into the water at various locations in the pond. Use the depth measurements you've obtained to calculate an average depth for the pond. The more measurements you take, the more accurate your average depth will be.  It is best to use herbicides in the spring when growth first starts. The cattail plants are smaller at this time, which makes application easier.   Read the directions on the herbicide container. Different formulas will have different water use restrictions. You need to familiarize yourself with these restrictions so you know when you can use the pond again for recreation or livestock use. The directions will also indicate how much herbicide to use based on the area and volume of your pond. Divide the pond into sections if you have a large amount of cattails to remove. Once the herbicide takes effect, the decomposition of the dead cattails can deplete the dissolved oxygen levels in the pond, killing fish. Killing fewer cattails at once will reduce the amount of decomposing vegetation in the pond. Use a pond or yard sprayer to distribute the chemical onto the cattails. Be careful to limit overspray as much as possible. Wait 10 to 14 days before spraying the next section if you chose to spray your pond in sections. This will help keep the dissolved oxygen levels in the pond more stable.    Wait 10 to 12 days before cutting the cattails to allow the chemical enough time to work. You want to provide adequate time for the herbicide to fully kill the root system. Use a weed whacker or sharp blade to cut down the cattails.	Choose a chemical removal method. Calculate the area and volume of your pond. Apply the herbicide to the cattails. Cut down the dead cattails. Remove the dead cattails from the pond.
This will help you. Remember they are what the bifauxnen style emulates.; , Look for men's slacks, pants, ties, suits, cuff links, watches, shirts and jewelry. Keep it classy and expensive looking. Even if you just spend 12.99 on one shirt, nobody should be able to tell by looking at your outfit. Be very careful that your clothes fit your body well. They shouldn't be too tight but the worst mistake would be to buy them too large. Baggy jeans and tees may sound like a good idea but lack the sophistication bifauxnen girls are trademarked for.  The trick is to wear it in ways that does not enhance your femininity but instead confuses people even more about your gender!  , Take a long look at Annie Lennox in the 80's and you'll see why.

Due to the multiple varieties of Sweet William and the different methods of growing them, you may hear conflicting information on when your flowers will grow and how long they will last. Biennial varieties bloom in their second year, and then die. Perennial varieties are supposed to regrow flowers year after year, but Sweet William perennials usually take two years to bloom and often die before they bloom a second time.   Correct care of Sweet William perennials increases the chance of reseeding, as described in the section on caring for Sweet William.; , If you want your Sweet William to flower reliably within a year, acquire seedlings or adult plants in fall or spring.Confirm with the previous owner that the plant will bloom this year before you take it home, since some seedlings may not flower until their second year.   Seeds that claim to be annuals (flowering and dying within one year) may or may not live up to the promise, depending on the variety and how it reacts to your local climate.  Sweet William seeds are tough enough to survive most winters, and can be planted in fall or late spring to bloom 12 to 18 months later.If the plants have already started growing, or if you are concerned about a harsh winter, you may keep the plants in indoor pots, then transplant them outdoors in early spring. Once the seedlings are six to eight weeks old, they will transplant easily, with low risk of causing damage., Sweet Williams grow fastest in full sun, but are best suited for cool climates. Ideally, they should receive four to five hours of direct sunlight a day, but planting them in light shade is a wise option if you live in a hot climate (USDA zone 8 and above)., Sweet William prefers loose, rich soil that is well draining. Water should drain quickly through the soil, and never pool on top of compact, hard soil. Optionally, you may churn up the existing soil and supplement it with potting soil to provide more nutrients. While you do not need to test the pH of your soil to successfully grow Sweet William, you may adjust the pH to slightly alkaline (approximately 6.75) if you already have a pH garden kit.Garden soil pH kits are available at garden supply stores or online. Again, this is not a mandatory tool for growing Sweet William, which are fairly adaptable when it comes to soil pH., Plant Sweet William in winter (hot climates only), spring, or summer (cool climates only). Place them on the surface and lightly cover them with 1/8 inch (0.6 cm) of soil, or dig a trench to this depth and refill after planting the seeds. Space the seeds 6 inches (15 cm) apart in ideal circumstances to reduce the chance of rot and disease transmission.If you do not have room to give them this much space, you may bunch them closer together, but take special care not to overwater in this case.   If you are transplanting seedlings, simply transfer the soil around the roots into a hole twice as wide as the soil ball, then refill. Take care not to bury any part of the seedling's stem; the plant should be buried to the same level it was before.  Sweet William seeds and seedlings benefit from an immediate watering after transplanting, but take care not to soak them with more water than can drain from the soil. Transplanted seedlings should be kept in moist but not soggy soil for a few days.Once they are established and recover from any withering that may occur, care for them as described in the care section.  Keep the soil around seedlings slightly moist to slightly dry. Once the plant is mature and no longer growing, most varieties will not require watering except during hot weather.As with any plant, water more frequently if it appears withered or the soil cracks.   Sweet William plants can rot if exposed to too much moisture, so be careful not to over-water. The soil should never feel soggy or contain pools of water.  If you wish to encourage faster growth and flowering, apply a general-purpose fertilizer to the soil once every 2–4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer, when growth or flowering is noticeable). Follow the instructions on your specific fertilizer carefully to avoid burning or damaging the plant.   It’s usually a good idea to dilute the fertilizer even more than specified on the container.  Spray a general purpose insecticide on young plants to discourage disease. Sweet William is susceptible to nematodes. If you see the presence of nematodes, which look like tiny, round worms, use a fungicide on the plants according to the manufacturer's instructions.    Note: if you are planning to eat the Sweet William flowers or feed them to a pet, do not treat with any type of pesticide.  Sweet William plants typically bloom during late spring or early summer, and then lose their flowers to the summer heat. When the flowers of Sweet William plants have dried, gently cut them off and discard them. This will encourage new blossom growth, and prevent the plant from dropping seeds if you wish to control your garden more closely.  If your Sweet William plants are cared for correctly, and the variety is suited to the climate, there's a good chance they will seed your garden with a new generation before dying. If you want a wide scattering of Sweet William plants in your garden, simply let the flowers mature, die, and drop seeds on their own.   Be aware that some flower varieties are hybrids of multiple plants, and may produce seeds that grow into plants with different appearance or characteristics than the parent plant.  In mid to late summer, after the flowers die, they will form dry, brown seed pods. Remove these once the pods are opening up at the end, about to release the seeds.Shake these pods into a container to get out the black, disc-shaped seeds for planting in fall or spring.  Once the seeds have dropped, or after you have harvested them yourself, cut the seed pods off at the stem. Usually, the Sweet William plants will have expended too much energy producing seeds to continue growing another year, but removing the pods will increase the chance of another bloom.  If you are lucky enough to have a Sweet William which survives more than a year or two, it may become quite large. In autumn or early spring, before much growth has started for the season, cut off one of the larger stems from near the base using a clean knife or shears. These cuttings can be planted to form new plants, although you may need to stake them to keep them upright.   Newly planted cuttings take time to form roots. Keep them in a warm, moist area away from direct sunlight to prevent them drying out while this happens. A few days underneath a transparent plastic bag or container may help create the moist conditions it needs.	Find out when your Sweet William will bloom. Acquire a growing plant if you want to see flowers within a year. Decide when to plant. Find an area with good sunlight but cool temperature. Check your soil. Sow your seeds. Water after planting. Water lightly. Fertilize the plants (optional). Treat young plants with insecticide. Deadhead the blooms. Allow thriving plants to reseed on their own. Harvest new seeds from the plants. Cut off dry stems after the seeds have dropped. Take cuttings from mature plants.
Pay attention and take note of your surroundings. The only thing that can fail you in any environment is lack of motivation. If you believe you will survive your chances are higher. Its all about will-power!; , The ideal water source would be a moving river with sandy banks.  Clean the bark off from a hard wood stick, dip the stick in water and beat the side of a sandy bank. This will embed sand into the sides of the stick. Keep doing so until ample abrasiveness is accomplished. Use this stick to sharpen your axe or knife.  Larger structures also waste physical resources and energy in building and upkeep. Also note that smaller shelters tend to trap more heat and heat up much easier than large shelters. Make sure to face it away from the prevailing wind. Also consider the fact that the shelter will need to drain any rain that comes.  Also note that after two days of not eating you will begin to lose energy. During those two days it is important to find a safe food source as in that time your body will still hold ample amounts of energy. Tips for this will be explicated below.  You can use the blunt end of your axe to snap softwood away from a tree. Larger softwoods tend to have a great many dry branches ideal for the making of fire. Also note that pine needles make ideal tinder. You will need this dry wood to produce safe food and water.  Be careful not to get pitch on your hands as the sticky sap can create large blisters if worked into your skin. The reason spruce is important is because boiling the needles into a tea makes the perfect morning drink. Imagine a cup of nasty-tasting orange juice with seven times as much Vitamin C. Note that this concoction will also save you from scurvy.  By successfully using snares and pitfalls one will only catch something on the rarer side of things. As that is the case it is important to set many snares, in varied locations. It is also important to remove all these snares before you move on.  If you cut down an ash you can pound the blunt end of the axe on a white, brown or black ash. This will loosen long strips that can be pulled off and used as shingles. If they break vertically while you pull them off the log simply use pitch to fill the cracks.   The ash is a sacred tree to many Native Americans. Native basket makers will often times offer tobacco before a tree is chopped down, it would be wise to make this offering, or one that can be deemed appropriate given your resources. This is out of respect for where the knowledge comes from and out of respect for the thing that helps you survive in adverse conditions.  Instead look to the smaller game trails that often yield quail, rabbit and smaller turkeys. These creatures can be captured using the stringy roots of spruce or the inner bark of basswood in the form of a snare.   The basswood snare is a powerful tool but is a native technology that requires the destruction of a tree. An offering of tobacco or some other comparable resource may be advisable. Never compromise survival to make such an offering.  There are very few places where man hasn't been. Signs of his presence include bottles, cans and often times wrappers useful for tinder. Also during the autumn rocky terrain is often hidden under a layer of leaves. Men have died because they did not check their footing with a good walking stick, as this tool can serve a number of purposes.  The earth gets cold at night. Lay a mattress of pine, cedar, juniper boughs, palm leaves, or just small wood or pine needles. More layers = more warmth.  Be prepared however to go anywhere from 10–50 miles (16–80 km), or much further, depending on the location.  Often times one reverts to wishful thinking in a time of crisis. Again be prepared to travel indefinite distances or you will not survive. In situations where you suspect that someone will be searching for you, it is generally advisable to stay put, provided you have sufficient food and water resources.  Once you give up there is nothing keeping you from dying. Humans can and do survive on virtually any terrain on Earth. If a technique is not successful, learn from the mistake and keep trying.	Be calm in the situation: You are your most valuable resource. Go to your nearest source of water: If you do not know where that is, then go downhill until you find a moving, clean source. Wet stick: Once you find a river you can make a traditional wet stick. Create a shelter: Build it with a small silhouette in mind as the larger it is the more it will catch wind. Use that axe: Once you have a relatively permanent position you have around three weeks in which you can use the axe before food deprivation can kill you or make you severely sick. Search for large amounts of dry wood that can easily be dragged to your shelter. You can use your axe to chop off spruce boughs. The only real significant source of fat and protein in the wild is that of meat. You can use your axe to make a waterproof shelter. Keep an eye out for game trails; avoid those that are large as they support larger predatory threat. Look for things you can use. To stay warm at night, get up off the ground. If your source of water is a river all you have to do is follow it downhill to find a road or town. It pays to be prepared before you move. Never revert to a state of apathy or indifference as the world is only as merciful as you make it.
Cut off the bottom "stump" of the vegetable.; ,, Make sure to change the water when it is dirty or turns yellow. Plant the vegetable/plant in soil one day after it has grown roots. The entire base (stump) of the vegetable should be covered by soil, exposing the leaves and base where leaves sprout from.	Take a cabbage, lettuce, or leafy green from the store or your fridge if you have one. Fill a container with cold or cool water (not covering the plant) and place the vegetable in it.  , Place in a sunny windowsill.

These can be found at most hardware or army surplus stores.Make sure that any professional grade mask you buy has removable side filters.; , You could use a half airsoft mask that only covers your mouth, or a full airsoft mask with the goggle portion removed.These can usually be found at sports equipment stores and can be cheaper than professional respirator masks.  If you cannot find a full respirator mask, or if your budget does not permit it, you could buy a simple dust mask, also called a particle respirator, instead. These masks do not have mouthpieces or filters and are usually simple white masks that fit over your mouth   If possible, look for one that comes with a thick strap instead of one that uses elastic string.  Twist or unscrew the filters on the side of your respirator mask. The mouthpiece of the mask can stay if it is fairly flat, but if it bulges out more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so, it should be removed, as well.   If you are using a full airsoft mask, remove the goggle portion and cut away any plastic that sits above the goggle glass. Use a sharp knife or saw to remove this plastic. Sand down any sharp edges with an electric sander to avoid injuring yourself on your mask.  Most professional respirator masks and airsoft masks have a small hole where the mouthpiece is/was located, in which case, you do not need to make a cut. If using a dust mask, however, you will need to cut a hole 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) across, directly above the point where your mouth will be.   To get a better idea of where the mouthpiece needs to be, place the dust mask on your face and use a pencil to mark where your mouth is on the mask. Remove the mask and cut the hole using scissors or a utility knife.  Use hot glue to attach these four pieces at even intervals along the top of the mouthpiece. The opposite should be glued down to the top part of the nose piece on your mask.   If you do not have a mouthpiece on your mask, put the mask on your face and lightly mark with pencil a line where your upper lip is. Arrange the pieces of tubing along this line at even intervals. Thin tubing like this can usually be found in a hardware store. For an easier, cheaper alternative, you could use flexible straws instead of tubing. Cut, bend, and shape the straws before gluing them down. Fabric glue or jeweler's glue can be used in place of hot glue if hot glue is unavailable.  Cut another four 3½ inch (8.89 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing. Use hot glue to attach these evenly along the bottom of the mouthpiece section. The other end of each piece of tubing should be glued down to the chin portion your mask.   If you do not have a mouthpiece on your mask, put the mask on and lightly mark the line where your lower lip is with a pencil. Arrange the pieces of tubing along this line equally. As suggested earlier, you might use bendy straws as an alternative to tubing.  Cut two 4½ inch (11.43 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing and two 7½ inch (19 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing. Starting with the smaller pieces:   Hot glue the smaller pieces directly next to the end pieces of tubing above the mouth. The lower end of these two new pieces of tubing should be hot glued to the sides of the mouthpiece. If your mask does not have a mouthpiece, then glue the other end to the midpoint in between your top and bottom mouth tubing rows. Hot glue the larger pieces next to those you just glued on to the top end. Glue the bottom end of these final pieces of tubing next to the bottom end of the lower mouth tubing row. As previously mentioned, you could use bendy straws as an alternative to tubing. Let everything dry completely so you do not break loose the seal of your glue.  Cut a strip of pleather, or other tough black cloth, so that is twice as wide as the width of your straps and just as long. Use hot glue or fabric glue to cover the side-straps with this material, hiding the seam or ends of the material on the inside of the strap.If you do not have wide straps on your mask and only have thin elastic cord, go out and buy a band of 2 inch (5 cm) thick black elastic. Cut this piece of elastic to match the length of your elastic cord and glue it to the mask over the cord. Keep the edges of this band on the inside of the mask to hide them.  Use a soft tape measure to determine the distance from the tip of your nose to the base of your skull. Also measure the width of the bridge of your nose at both the top and bottom.   For a more accurate fit, place the mouthpiece portion of your mask on before proceeding. Measure from the top of this mouthpiece, over your face and head, and down to the point at which the strap meets in the back of your head.  Look for black soft foam that is no thicker than ½ inch (1¼ cm). Use fabric scissors to cut out a strip of foam that matches the measurement of the top of your head, plus one inch (2½ cm) to allow overlap for gluing., To begin with, the foam should be as thick as the widest part of your nose. Next, you will contour the shape of your strip to fit your nose better.  On one end of the foam, narrow down the part where the upper bridge of your nose will be. If necessary, place the foam over your head temporarily and mark the area you will need to trim with a pencil.  Lay your foam over another piece of black pleather and trace the shape onto the other material. Use fabric scissors to cut the shape out of the pleather.   If you do not have pleather, choose another durable, tough black fabric.  Apply thin lines of hot glue to the back of the pleather and press the foam in place onto the glue. Make sure that the edges line up as evenly as possible.  The narrowed part of your headpiece needs to be hot glued just above the top part of your mask nose piece. The wider, even section of the back of your foam strip should be glued to the pleather-covered strap in the back.   Make sure that the strap goes across the front, top, and back of your head in a straight line. Glue the edges of the foam headpiece to the inside of your mouthpiece, hiding them from sight.  Cut two pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing that match the measurement you took of the top of your head. These pieces should be the same length as the strip of fabric that covers the front, top, and back of your head.   Hot glue these pieces of tubing along the edges of the top headpiece, one tube to each edge.  Note: these pieces of tubing are too long to substitute plastic flexible straws. If you cannot find tubing, you could either skip this step or use pipe cleaners covered in pleather in place of the tubing.  Take small bolts and hot glue them in pairs along the top headpiece. Each bolt should be on the inside of the tubing along the edge of your headpiece.   You should have five to eight pairs of bolts, or 10 to 16 individual bolts, in total. Space the pairs apart at even intervals. If you do not have bolts, you can use belt studs or similar metallic objects, instead.  Bane's mouthpiece is a dark, intimidating black. To get a consistent, uniform appearance, use spray paint that is labeled to work on a variety of materials (metal, plastic, fabric) and spray the entire mask black.Depending on where you spray paint, you may want to put a layer of newspaper or a drop cloth down before spray painting. Let your mask dry for several hours in a warm spot with low humidity.  For a slightly more authentic look, you can use silver metallic paint and a paintbrush to paint the tubing of your mask silver. This is not strictly necessary, but can add more realism to the final mask.   Check the label to make sure that the paint is safe for use on plastic. Let the paint dry.  Your Bane mask should now be complete. Try it on and see how it looks. If you notice that the straps are loose or tight, make necessary adjustments by trimming down or gluing extra fabric to lengthen the straps.	Find a respirator mask that fits your mouth.A respirator mask with filters on the side and a mouthpiece over the front is preferred. Convert an airsoft mask for tighter budgets. Use a particle respirator for extreme budgeting. Remove any unnecessary pieces. Cut a hole into the mask, if necessary. Attach thin tubing above the mouth area.Cut four 3½ inch (8.89 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) thick tubing. Attach thin tubing below the mouth area. Attach thin tubing over the cheeks. Cover the side straps of your mask with pleather. Measure the top of your head. Cut a piece of flexible foam to match the measurement. Trim the strip to the width of your nose. Fit your strip to the shape of your nose. Cut a matching piece of pleather. Attach the pleather to the foam. Attach the foam to your mouthpiece. Place thin tubing alone the sides of your top headpiece. Glue small bolts near the headpiece tubing. Spray paint your mask black. Paint the mouth tubing silver, if desired. Try the mask on.

The high traffic areas of your home with travertine floors, such as a doorway or a hallway, are more susceptible to damage. In order to keep your floors pristine, it is necessary to provide additional protection to high traffic areas. Protect these areas from abrasive dirt and damaging grime with seasonal doormats, sleek runners, and timeless area rugs., Travertine floors are easily damaged and must be cleaned with care. To maintain a well-kept floor, vacuum, dust, and sweep your travertine regularly.   Never drag an upright or full sized canister vacuum across your floor to suck up debris. Instead, suck up abrasive debris that might scrape your floors, such as dirt and gravel, with a handheld vacuum. Remove dirt and debris from your floors with a dry dust mop.  When washing your floors, only use a soapless, neutral PH 7 mild abrasive cleaner and water. Always follow the product’s instructions. Use broad sweeping motions that overlap to clean your floor. Dry and polish with a clean microfiber cloth.   To deep clean your floors, you may use an automatic scrubber with disk brush attachment., As a porous stone, travertine stains easily. After identifying what caused the stain, use specific products to remove the blemish.   Oil-based stains darken the stone and must be removed with chemicals. Blot the stain with a clean cloth to remove any excess residue. To remove the stain, use a soft liquid household cleaner, such as ammonia, acetone, or detergent. Apply the product to the stone on a damp cloth. Place the cloth over the stain to draw out the oil-based product.Organic stains, such as those caused by coffee, juice, urine, and food, turn the travertine pink or brown. Remove these stains with a mixture of 12% hydrogen peroxide—food grade hydrogen peroxide—and a few drops of ammonia.Apply the product to the stone on a damp cloth. Place the cloth over the stain to draw out the organic stain.The method for removing ink stains varies based on the color of the stone. If the stain is on a light colored stone, use bleach or hydrogen peroxide; if the stain is on a dark colored stone, it is best to use acetone or lacquer thinner. Apply the product to the stone on a damp cloth. Place the cloth over the stain to draw out the ink stain.To remove water stains, buff the blemish with #0000 steel wool.Before you can remove etch marks, you must thoroughly remove the acid that caused them. Once the acid is removed, wet the surface and use a buffing pad to apply marble polishing powder. Buff and polish until the marks are gone., Clean travertine installed outdoors at least once per year. Rinse the stone with water to remove excess dirt and debris.

Watch music videos of dancers who perform in the same genre as the song you chose. This will help you start to get an idea of what your dance should look like. It’s okay to take a few moves from the videos here and there, but don’t copy it directly. Rather, pay attention to the way that they move their body and how you might like to emulate that style.For example, if you are planning to make up a hip hop and R&B dance pay close attention to how the artist you are watching uses their hips. Hips can help keep the rhythm and add a lot of spice to a dance. Search for similar dances in the style you chose. Try searching for famous dances in the genre that you want to dance in.  For example, if you already know that you can do cartwheels very well then you should consider incorporating that move into your dance. If you have great balance and coordination, maybe balletic moves are a better idea to incorporate. Consider the ways in which you are comfortable moving your body and cater your dance that way.  Sometimes the best dance moves are the ones that will come most naturally to you. If you try to be too robotic by mimicking others the dance won’t look as good. Just move with the music and do what comes naturally. Start by swaying around a little bit and moving your arms and legs. If you’re alone you have nothing to be embarrassed about., If you’re really struggling to dance or you just feel awkward or uncomfortable, consider taking dance lessons.

Slide the tonneau rail all the way forward to the bulk head. It is a good idea to have a squeeze clamp or similar to hold it in place.  Tighten with a wrench or socket. Hold down firmly on the rail while tightening., Remember to hold down firmly on that truck bed cover rail while tightening to ensure a nice snug fit to keep the weather out., To do this, drill the appropriate size hole in the plastic plug in the front lower corner of the truck bed. There is one on either side. You may have a bed liner so you will have to drill a hole through both the bed liner and the plastic plug.  Now run the drain tube all the way through the plastic plug and bed liner if you have one. Connect the end of the drain tube on the drain nipple underneath the rail. Do both sides.  Make sure the 6–8 inch (15.2–20.3 cm) panel of the cover is in place near the cab., Move it along until the bolt holes align with the holes in the cab end of the side rails. Install the bolts provided, on either side of the cover in these holes. Place the rubber washer first then the flat washer and then the lock washer and the star nut on loosely. Do not tighten yet., Make sure the tailgate is closed before unfolding the last section down onto it. Make sure the cover looks all aligned. Open the tailgate, crawl up inside being careful not to move anything and tighten the two star nuts., Place them underneath the last wide panel near the cab so that when the cover is folded open the rubber strip keeps the open Bakflip HD from hitting your truck cab., Make sure everything works properly and make adjustments if needed.	Place the rail of the Bakflip HD on right hand side bed rail of the F150. Place the included rail clamps in place. Do the left side rail the same. Install the drain tub. Place the Bakflip HD pickup bed cover in place between the rails in the folded position. Slide the folded cover towards the cab. Unfold the cover to the closed position. Find the three rubber strips provided. Close the cover.
If you think you are being followed, make false turns. If the driver behind you continues to pursue, go to your nearest police station., Stay in the center lane when possible. Don’t turn your attention to a cell phone or radio.Observe 360 degrees around you through your mirrors and windows.Keep distance between your car and the one in front of you. This enables you to get around the car in front of you if it stalls or if someone suspicious approaches your car.Keep about one-half of the length of your vehicle between you and the vehicle ahead of you, so that you can maneuver out if necessary. As a rule of thumb, you should be able to see the rear tires of the vehicle ahead of you.  Carjackers use a ruse called “The Bump.” They rear-end cars and steal them when the drivers get out to assess the damage and gather information. If your car gets hit from behind, only pull over and get out when you reach a safe, public place.Stay inside your vehicle with the doors locked and windows shut. Signal to the other driver to follow you and drive to the nearest police or fire station. If you see that the other driver is not following you, take note of their license plate number., Placing paper money (real or fake) or even fliers under your windshield wiper is a trick criminals can use to get you out of your car. If you see money on your windshield and exit your vehicle to grab it, a carjacker can rush into your vehicle and actually run you over as well as steal your car., Carjackers try to take advantage of people’s empathy by creating ruses. If someone is flashing their lights and trying to wave you over to the side of the road, or is appearing to be injured from an accident and is soliciting your attention, don’t stop.If someone was trying to signal that there is a problem with your vehicle, keep driving and pull over when you find a safe public place. If someone appeared to be injured and needed help, call the authorities or go to your nearest police or fire station to tell them what you saw.  Most attempted or successful carjackings happen within 5 miles of the victim’s place of residence.Carjackers may surveil cars returning to gating communities and trap you in before the gate opens. If you’re returning home to your own residence, wait on the street until the gate is opened if necessary, so that a car cannot pull up behind you and trap you in.If you are visiting someone else’s gated community, call ahead to have the gate opened.  Keep your head up, ears open, and eyes peeled when you’re returning to your car. Don’t ignore your gut feeling if you sense that something is wrong. If you see someone standing around in the parking lot, or you merely sense something is not right, don’t proceed to your car. Return to a place where people are and ask for a security escort to walk you to your car. If that is not possible, wait for a group of people and walk with them.92% of carjackings happen to victims who are alone.Look under, around and inside your car.Don’t allow children or packages to distract from your alertness. Make it a habit to look around before putting anything or anyone into the car.  If you must stop at a drive-thru ATM, have your ATM card ready, keep your car in drive, and pull up as close to the ATM as possible. Check your rearview mirror before stopping.Avoid isolated payphones, newspaper machines and parking lots.  Not all carjackings happen under the cloak of night. In fact, more than half (64%) of daytime carjacking attempts are successful.Be as alert during the daylight as you would be at nighttime.	Check your mirrors for anyone possibly following you. Stay alert at intersections. Know how to react if your car is bumped from behind. Don’t get out of the car if something is under your windshield wiper. Be wary of people trying to get your attention. Avoid surveillance traps in gated communities. Look, listen, and trust your instincts when approaching your car. Don’t stop at isolated phones or money machines. Don’t disregard safety because it’s daytime.
Lay your fabric flat (or folded in half, if the pattern directs you to do so) and place your pattern over the top. Follow your traced lines and the guide to cut out your fabric in the matching shapes. If you are using a dress for the pattern use your traced outline of half the dress, drawn after being folded in half and placed along the folded edge. Cut along this line, and unfold the fabric to expose a complete front of your dress.   Add ½ inch of extra fabric around the edges of the dress for seam allowances. Most patterns already have this included in their measurements, but you will need to keep this in mind if you are tracing a dress for your pattern. If you want to add sleeves to your dress, these will need to be cut as separate pieces from the body of the dress. Cut your dress fabric in a tank-style top and then sew your sleeves on later. Be sure to cut the fabric for the back of this dress as well at this point, using the same method as you did to cut the front.  Follow the sewing directions on your pattern. Typically the sides of the dress will be sewn first. Turn your fabric inside-out and fold ¼ of an inch over on either side, using an iron to flatten it out. Then, use a zigzag stitch to sew the front and back together, and a top stitch to attach your newly formed seam to the body of the dress. The top stitch will help the fabric to lay flat along the seam and add a more professional look to your dress.   Follow any specific directions on your pattern for sewing additional sections of your dress. If your pattern directs you to sew something other than the sides first, do so.  For a simple neckline, fold over ¼ inch of fabric along the edge and iron it flat. Use a straight stitch along the collar to sew the edges in place and keep them from fraying. You can adjust how deep the neckline plunges by measuring the distance from your waist to the desired area on your bust, and adjusting your fabric accordingly.  on the bottom of the dress, fold over ¼ of an inch of fabric and iron it down flat. If you have one available, use a serger to secure the ends and keep them from unraveling. Then, use a straight stitch to attach the folded edge to the bottom of the dress, holding it in place. So you won't make a mistake.  If you want, add a zipper to the side or back of your dress to allow for easier opening/closure. You can also choose to add a lace overlay, ruffles, trim, or beading to your dress for an added touch. It’s your dress, and your opportunity to show your style! Do so as you please.	Cut your fabric. Begin sewing. Sew the neckline. Add the hem. Finish off your dress.
This will form the body of your compost bin, which will be a cylinder shape. This bin will be able to compost things like yard waste, sawdust, and leaves. It can only be used outdoors over soil and will compost very slowly.          The height of the rectangle will be the height of your bin. The length of the rectangle will be the diameter of your bin. If you’re not sure where to begin, hold the uncut chicken wire in front of you to get a sense of how tall and wide you’d like it to be. Since you’ll be filling this bin with yard waste, err on the large side.  These will be staked into the ground to maintain the shape of your wire bin, so be sure that they are longer than the height of your chicken wire.  Stretching it out will make it easier to work with.  This works best of you place the stake beneath the wire. The top of the stake should stick out slightly above the top of the wire.  Your chicken wire should now be in the shape of a cylinder.  It may be necessary to crawl inside the wire to reach the stake better.  Make sure you choose a spot that won’t get in your way later.  Be sure to stake them close enough to the wire that they don’t pull it out of shape. When you are done, the four stakes should be in the shape of a square.  Once the bin is fully secured, you can start filling it with yard waste.	Cut out a large rectangle of chicken wire. Make four stakes out of scrap wood. Flatten your rectangle of chicken wire onto the ground. Using a staple gun, attach a stake along one of the short edges of your chicken wire. Roll the other side of the chicken wire up and over so that the unstacked end overlaps the staked end. Staple the edge of your chicken wire along the stake. Stake your unfinished bin into the ground. Drive your other three stakes into the ground around the bin. Staple the remaining stakes to the chicken wire.
Wrap twine around the handle of the colander, making sure to wrap the twine tightly to avoid gaps. Secure the twine by tying it and adding a little glue. Repeat the same process on the colander’s other handle.Place sheet moss inside the colander to line it. Fill the colander with potting soil, then plant ferns and pansies inside. Attach four lengths of twine to the colander handles, then use the twine to hang the colander in a sunny spot.; , To complete this project, you will need a pair of old rain boots, a metal grommet, some burlap ribbon and two cylindrical vases. Install a grommet into the back of each boot, using a hammer.Thread a piece of burlap ribbon through both grommets. Place a 3-inch-wide vase in each boot and fill the vases with flowers. If the vases seem unstable, pack the bottom of the boots with tissue paper. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a knot, then hang the display from a nail in your front door. Grommets can be purchased at any hardware store.  Take a handkerchief and use sewing scissors to cut out a four-inch square. Place the square pattern side up, then fold three of the corners inward, towards the square’s center.Sew the three sides together to create a pouch that looks like an envelope. Turn the sachet inside out and press it with an iron. Sew a button on the flap (this will be strictly decorative). Pour dried lavender or other dried flowers into the pouch, then sew the flap shut.	Create a planter out of a colander. Make a door display with old boots. Sew a sachet out of a handkerchief.
It's a good idea to keep one in your car and another at your place of work. The basic disaster supply kit should hold you for 3 days, but to survive the long haul, you will need much more.   A good kit would have the following: 5000 watt generator which will run for 13.4 hours on 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of gas. Four 5 gallon (18.9 L) gas cans for the generator. Four 100 foot (30.5 m) extension cords. Small 25cc gas powered mini-water pump. (to remove any flood water from house or yard) several cases of canned goods. (soup, stew, beans, etc) powdered milk and eggs. Fifty 1 gallon (3.8 L) jugs of drinking water. (1 gallon per day per person) a week supply of clean dry clothes sealed in plastic bags placed into large plastic totes. charcoal, lighter fluid, and waterproof camping matches. (enough to grill 7-10 times) A 2 burner Coleman propane camp stove and extra bottles of propane. Light choices, pick more than one. Coleman battery powered lantern, propane powered, and camp fuel powered. Extra batteries for everything. Energizer battery powered cell phone charger. Military MREs (meals ready to eat, bought at army surplus store,,,civilian level bought at academy sporting goods) Chain saw. Plastic painters drop cloths. Large plastic tarps. Elastic straps and nylon rope to tie down/secure things. NOAA weather radio. First aid kit. Sanitation and hygiene items and BABY WIPES. Large Igloo maxcold cooler packed with ice (should keep ice for 7-10 days) 20 extra gallons of gas for your vehicle. Extra supply of Deet insect repellent. A large camping tent, sleeping bags and an air bed w/pump. Camera, cash, loose change, medication, pet food, something to read and some board games.; , With flooded streets, downed power lines, and no traffic signals, it's just not safe.  Look for downed power lines, trees, or unstable building conditions. If it's something as simple as tree branches on your house or vehicle, use the chainsaw to cut up and remove the branches, and then the tarps to patch the damage.  Remember that mold may soon follow so you may have to go to the tent.  You must keep that generator away from your home when it's running. Carbon monoxide poisoning kills, and even if it's outside, but near an open window, it's deadly. Because you have a few hundred feet of extension cord, get that generator nice and far away. With the double male ended cord you can plug into the generator and then into any outlet in the house. This will power every circuit connected to that wall plug. You can also keep power to your fridge, but you do not have to have it going 24/7... it will keep everything cold enough if you only leave it running for an hour every few hours. Now we have meat! Although you have the ability to use an electric range/stove, why not get out there and grill some of that meat. you have the choice of charcoal, propane, or electric.	Have a disaster kit with the basic supplies in your home. Right after the storm, avoid driving if at all possible. Explore your property and avoid any unsafe conditions. If there was some flooding, use the small gas powered water pump to clear your house. Now that you know you are safe at home, get ready to hold up there until power comes back and water service is restored and safe to drink.
Insert the needle through the fabric at the starting point of your stitch line, A. Poke through from the back of the fabric to the front.   Pull the needle and thread completely through so that the end knot lies flush against the back of the fabric. Your A point should be at the bottom right edge of your desired stitch line.; , Cross over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at a position directly above your A point. This new insertion point will be point B.   Pull the needle and thread completely through to the back of the fabric, creating a flat vertical stitch between A and B. This stitch must be straight, not slanted. The distance between A and B will be the width of your stitch. Unless otherwise specified, a width of 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) should suffice.  Insert the needle through the fabric at A again. Pull the needle and thread through from back to front.   Tighten the thread until it creates a flat vertical stitch at the back of the fabric, mirroring the one on the front.  Cross the thread over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at a point lying even with B and to the left. This will be your C point.   The horizontal distance between B and C should roughly match the stitch width. In this example, it should be 1/4 inch (6.35 mm). Continue pulling the needle and thread through to the back of the fabric until a flat diagonal stitch connecting A and C appears on the front of the fabric.  Insert the needle through the fabric from back to front, bringing it through at a point vertically beneath C and to the horizontal left of A. This newest point is point D.   Pull the thread through completely, creating a flat vertical stitch along the back of the fabric from C to D. With this step, you have completed a single zigzag stitch.  Repeat the steps used to create the first stitch down the entire length of your stitch row. End the row with a vertical stitch.   Reset your stitch labels at the end of each complete zigzag stitch. In other words, the C point of your first zigzag becomes the B point of your second, and the D point of your first zigzag becomes the A point of your second. For each stitch:  Stitch a vertical line between A and B on the front of the fabric. Stitch a vertical line between B and A along the back, inserting the needle through to the front at A again. Stitch diagonally across the front of the fabric from A to C. Stitch a vertical line along the back of the fabric from C to D, inserting the needle through to the front at D.   End the row with a vertical stitch across the front of the fabric between the D and C of your final zigzag. Make sure that you maintain the same stitch width and length for each zigzag.  Rename your stitch labels so that E is the bottom of your last vertical stitch and F is the top point of that same stitch. Cross over this final vertical stitch so that the needle comes out to the front of the fabric at E.   If done correctly, the stitch prior to this should have gone through to the back of the fabric at F. To complete this step, make a vertical stitch along the back of the fabric from F to E, inserting the needle through E.  Cross over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at the top point of the adjacent vertical stitch, now identified as point G. Pull the thread through to create a flat diagonal stitch.   This newest diagonal stitch should cross over the center of the last diagonal stitch made during your first trip down the length of the row. The resulting stitch will be x-shaped. Note that G lies to the horizontal right of F.  Insert the needle through to the front of the fabric at the bottom point of the current vertical post you're resting on. This point can now be referred to as point H.   Point H is directly beneath point G and to the right of E.  Zigzag your stitches down the length of the row, working from the left edge to the right edge. End by overlapping the very first vertical post you made.   These stitches should be nearly identical to the ones you created down the first pass, but they will slant in the opposite direction (left to right instead of right to left). For each stitch:  Stitch a vertical line between E and F on the front of the fabric, overlapping the vertical post already there. Stitch between F and E along the back of the fabric, inserting through to the front at E again. Stitch diagonally across the front from E to G. Stitch between G and H along the back of the fabric, inserting through to the front at H.   The end of the row should conclude with a vertical stitch between your final H and G points.  If done correctly, the needle and thread should be at the back of your fabric. Knot the thread here and cut off any excess thread to complete the zigzag row.   To knot the thread:  Bring the needle through the front and back of the fabric at a spot directly next to your current insertion point. Before drawing the thread flat, insert the needle through the loop you just created. Do so two or three times, then draw the loop closed. This should create a secure knot.	Poke through to the front of the fabric. Stitch a vertical line. Return to the starting point. Move the stitch diagonally across. Bring the needle back through to the front. Repeat the stitch down the length of the row. Overlap the end point. Cross over the last diagonal stitch. Double behind the vertical post. Work your way back down the length of the row. Knot the stitch in the back.
One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered (hidden) but is now "found" under that hose.  Or you could get them up from the ports if you find a way to use a piece of hose inserted snugly over each spark plug after each is unscrewed.  Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them. , You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it., With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little "bump" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a "remote push-button starter switch" or by wiggling the ignition switch to "nudge and thump" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.  Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. To do that position a breakover wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in and about by heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out or from side to side -- but no hands or feet trying to hold it. Bump the ignition switch (turn momentarily) to make starter motor "bump."  , It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little "zinging/whizzing" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware.  Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally "bumped" or turned away from TDC (top dead center) by the starter motor in error.	Remove two short 10mm bolts (all bolts should be hex-head, unless some newer models use Torx/Star bolt heads) holding the power steering hose on where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way for removing the valve cover in a later step. Remove spark plugs use a spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside the socket so that it helps to lift plugs them out of the deep access ports.Prevent dirt, trash or any screws (or ceramic-glass pieces if you broke a spark plug) from falling into the cylinders any of which could cause very serious damage to the engine. Loosen the harmonic pulley (but do not remove it at this time) retainer bolt (21mm, 13/16 inch) but keep it in but "finger-tight" (snug). Consider using the power of the starter motor (only with the spark plugs taken out -- not holding the wrench by hand or foot). See whether it loosened the bolt--but if not, then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again.
It is illegal in many areas to sand paint from the fiberglass components off your car in the open air, while other places permit it if you use special attachments on a vacuum as you sand to catch as much particulate as possible. Check on the website for your town or state for laws in your area.The particulate from sanding off paint becomes airborne and can be bad for the environment. In some places, it is illegal to sand the paint off of your vehicle without a specialized facility.; , Because the particulate you sand off of your vehicle can be hazardous to breath, find an isolated or enclosed area you can sand your vehicle. Sanding out in the open will allow the particulate to spread further, possibly effecting anyone who lives nearby.A garage with an air filtration system is the best environment to sand your vehicle. If you are sanding outdoors, try to wait for a day that has very little wind.  Because of the dangers of airborne particulate while sanding, be sure to wear goggles and a respirator. You may consider using a regular paper or cloth face mask, but you will need to replace the mask periodically if dust becomes caked onto the mask.Goggle style safety glasses are required to prevent the paint from getting into your eyes. You can purchase respirators at most hardware and auto parts stores.  You will need multiple grades of sandpaper to remove the paint and leave a smooth surface in the fiberglass. Start with 120 grit sandpaper and sand in a back and forth or circular motion to begin removing the paint. Switch to a finer grade sandpaper like 80 grit once you have removed the majority of the paint and re-sand the area.Don’t worry about making the fiberglass completely smooth; a slightly abrasive surface will help the new paint stick. Be careful not to sand beyond the paint and through the fiberglass. If you choose to use a power sander, be careful not to sand too deep through the paint with either grit of paper.  If you are planning on repainting the surface, you don’t need to remove all of the paint from the fiberglass. Instead, use the 120 grit sandpaper to remove any loose or bubbled paint, then score the rest of the surface by lightly sanding over all of it.The new paint will stick to the scored paint you left on the fiberglass. Make sure to wash and rinse the part before repainting the fiberglass. It will be covered in dust from the sanding process.	Check local regulations. Find a safe place to sand. Wear appropriate safety gear. Choose the appropriate sand paper. Sand only as much as you have to.
An easy composting mistake can be avoided by leaving fats, dairy, meat, and bones out of your compost. These materials will go rancid and generate unpleasant odors as well as attracting rodents and other unwanted animals to your compost. Meats and dairy also provide a breeding ground for harmful pathogens.; , Another common composting mistake is using too little or too much water in your compost pile. Ideally, a handful of your compost should have the consistency of a wrung-out sponge - moist but not dripping.   If a compost pile has too little moisture, it will decompose very slowly because the bacteria and fungus need moisture to break down the materials. A dry compost pile can also attract ants and wasps, so add more water immediately if you see these insects proliferating. If a compost pile is too wet, the microbial organisms in it will start reproducing anaerobically because the water has choked off their oxygen supply. This can be diagnosed by a foul ammonia-like smell.  Another composting mistake that can be made fairly easily is improperly adjusting the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the compost. Carbon-rich materials, including paper, dried leaves, and cardboard, should make up about 3/4 of the pile's volume. Nitrogen-rich materials, such as coffee grounds, vegetable scraps, and grass clippings, should comprise the remaining 25 percent.   If your compost has too little nitrogen, it will decompose very slowly. Unlike a compost pile with too little moisture, however, it will not necessarily attract ants and wasps. If a compost pile has too little carbon, the excess nitrogen-rich materials will be metabolized anaerobically, generating an ammonia-like odor.  The bacteria and fungus that drive the decomposition need a continuous supply of fresh oxygen to do their work. This oxygen will be cut off if your compost pile is too dense, leading again to an ammonia-like odor. Loosen your compost with a pitchfork and add loose materials like tree branches to remedy this problem.  A composting mistake often made by newcomers is to purchase earthworms or microbial inoculation kits to get their compost piles going. These kits are essentially "snake oil," and are never needed to start or maintain a healthy compost pile. Native worms, bacteria, and fungus will be attracted to your compost pile from its very first day.	Avoid placing animal products into your compost pile. Ensure that the moisture level in your compost pile is ideal. Ensure that the ratio of carbon to nitrogen is ideal. Avoid compacting your compost too densely. Do not purchase earthworms or inoculation kits for your compost.
Some types of sewing are more complex in the requirements for threads because they require decorative as well as practical sewing techniques. Other types are very straightforward, such as simple sewing, which is best performed with commonplace, simple cotton or rayon threads. The general types of sewing include:    Darning to repair rips, tears, and holes in garments and fabric items Sewing up a pattern such as a dress, apron, etc.  Embroidery: this covers a very wide range of possible sewing techniques including needlepoint, cross-stitch, hardanger, blackwork, stumpwork, whitework, shadow work, crewel work, ribbon embroidery, etc. The threads for embroidery may be many and varied, even within a single project.; , They are:   Cotton threads Nylon/rayon threads (including invisible thread) Silk threads (and silk ribbons) Wool threads Metallic threads Bobbin threads (for machine sewing) Designer threads (mixed threads made by combining different types of threads, e.g., cottons with rayon with silk, etc.)  , Knowing the properties of the threads will help you to decide the usefulness and desirability of using them for your specific project. The following list with explanations will help you choose a thread that is suitable for your project:    Cotton thread: The usual cotton thread found on reels in most haberdashery and craft stores is ideal for basic sewing. Most cotton threads are mercerized, a coating that lets the dye take more easily and results in a lustrous appearance. This cotton has limitations, however, as it has no "give" and can break if used on fluid fabrics, such as stretch knit fabric. On the plus side, cotton is ideal for delicate fabrics and projects, such as lingerie and sheer fabrics.  All-purpose cotton - a medium thickness cotton (size 50) is suitable for sewing a wide range of projects using lightweight to medium cotton, linen and rayon fabrics. Stranded cotton - this is made of six strands that have been woven together loosely. These are usually used in embroidery and are often best unwound prior to use or the end result will be too thick, although with wider weave fabrics, using all strands can sometimes be very effective. Coton perlé - this thread cannot be divided and is used in embroidery projects to produce a neat sheen. Cotton à broder - an embroidery cotton in varying weights. It has a smooth quality. Tatting thread - not a separate thread as such, but the type of cotton required for tatting is very specialized. It should be highly mercerized and tightly twisted, so that it is very firm and smooth. Flower thread - this has a matte sheen and is soft. This thread is ideal for embroidery projects that require a rustic, old-fashioned look, particularly samplers on fine linen. It is only suitable for fabric with a small count. Quilting thread - this is all-cotton thread that is coated for ease of movement through quilt fabric and batting. Obviously, this is ideal for quilting projects.    Polyester threads: These are strong threads that have excellent give for sewing projects. They tend to come in an all-purpose weight (size 50); they often have a wax or silicone finish that allows the thread to slip through fabric with little friction. This is suitable for most machine and hand sewing projects. This thread is suitable for fabrics with stretch in them and is especially good for woven synthetics, knits and stretch fabrics. The appearance of this thread will be waxy or shiny, not matte like plain cotton.  All-purpose thread - this is cotton-wrapped polyester thread and is widely available for sewing. This is suitable for using with most fabrics and is cheap and easily obtainable. It is not, however, a good thread to use for embroidery projects. Invisible thread - this is similar to fishing line. It's strong and it's invisible, making it ideal for projects where you need the sewing to be strongly kept in place and hidden at the same time.    Heavy duty: Heavy duty thread is ideal for heavy duty fabrics, such as those used in soft furnishings like upholstery and window dressings, vinyl, and coat fabrics. This is usually around size 40 and can be made from polyester, cotton-wrapped polyester, or cotton.  Rayon threads: Rayon embroidery thread works well to create flat stitches where cotton embroidery thread might stand too high.  Nylon threads: This is a strong thread that is suitable for using on light to medium weight synthetic fabrics. It is a fine thread, usually in size A.  Silk threads: Silk is a fine thread that is ideal for a range of fabrics, although silk is often reserved for embroidery work, same for silk ribbon. This strong thread is ideal for sewing on silk and wool, and for for basting all fabrics. The benefit is that silk threads do not leave holes and it is very flexible. An excellent tailoring thread.  Silk floss - this thread has a high sheen. It is also known as Japanese silk. It comes untwisted and can be used as it is, or divided to make even finer stitches. This thread is suitable for embroidery projects and for using on silk fabric projects. Although strong, it is delicate to work with, so it is vital to have trimmed fingernails to avoid catching and tearing. Twisted silk - this thread consists of several strands of silk twisted together; again it is ideal for embroidery and can be used as it is, or separated into smaller threads. Stranded silk - these threads have a sparkling look and can be separated into strands for sewing in embroidery projects. Silk ribbon - silk ribbon is used for silk ribbon embroidery, both as projects in their own right, and for decorative projects such as on handbags, tops, skirts, etc. and for hair accessories.    Wool threads: Wool threads tend to be used for embroidery projects and for blankets (using blanket stitch). Wool works best with heavy fabrics, such as wool, or canvas.  Persian wool - Persian wool consists of three strands. You can use the three strands together or separate the threads to use singly. Whether or not you separate the threads will depend on the project and the thickness of the fabric being sewn. Tapestry wool - this wool is not as thick as the Persian wool. It is not dividable. Crewel wool - this is the finest of the wool threads. It is ideal for crewel embroidery projects. While it is fine, you can weave it into a thicker thread by twisting with more threads.    Machine threads: These are the threads inserted into a sewing machine.  Bobbin threads - this is an affordable thread that goes on the bobbin; it is commonplace for use on sewing machines and is used for a wide variety of general sewing projects made on the sewing machine. Variegated thread - these threads are dyed different shades, the variegation repeating along the length of the thread in an even manner. Suitable generally for embroidery projects or colorful sewing projects, such as crazy quilt jackets, etc.    Metallic threads: Metallic threads are used for goldwork embroidery and for embellishment on items such as handbags. The colors are gold, silver, and copper.  Purl thread - this thread is hollow. Also twist thread and pearl purl Japan thread - this is a very fine metallic thread that usually requires two threads used at the same time.  Once you have decided which type and strength of thread is suitable for your project, you will need to match its color. This is where it is a really good idea to purchase the entire quantity of thread in the color you are using to ensure that you keep the same batch color quality throughout the sewing project, especially in the case of embroidery. If you cannot find an exact color match, select a color of thread one to two shades darker than the fabric color to blend in. Light thread will stand out much more.  It is important to read the instructions of any sewing pattern or embroidery project from beginning to end prior to undertaking a project. The pattern or instructions should tell you what thread it recommends. It is a good idea to try to match the recommendation exactly, or as closely as possible, to ensure the best outcome for the project. When you are more experienced, you will be able to make thread substitutes with the full understanding of the end results.  Cheap thread is cheap thread and will not last. Quality thread costs more but is definitely worth it to ensure the quality and durability of your project in the long-run, as well as making the stitching process easier and more enjoyable, especially in the case of embroidering.	Identify which type of sewing you are undertaking. Learn the main types of sewing thread. Consider the qualities of sewing thread. Select sewing thread according to the right color. Consult the sewing instructions. Purchase quality thread.
The item should be no larger than your thumb. Flat items are best, but you can use a slightly-raised item, such as a button or cabochon. Here are some items that make great pins:   Cabochons Decorative buttons (such as coat buttons) Embroidered patches Metal bottle caps Wooden shapes  , Soak a cotton ball or tissue with rubbing alcohol and run it across the back of the item. This will get rid of any oils or dirt that might prevent the glue from sticking properly.  When you place the safety pin behind your found object, you should not see it sticking out.  You can use hot glue, but super glue or epoxy glue will work even better.  Flip the object over, so that the back is facing you. Quickly press the safety pin onto the back. Try to align it horizontally, and make it as centered as possible.  If you are using hot glue, this will only take a few minutes. If you are using super glue or epoxy glue, this may take several hours.	Find something small, light, and with a flat back. Wipe the back of the object with rubbing alcohol. Find a flat backed safety pin that is a little bit narrower than your item. Draw a line of glue along the back of the pin. Press the back of the safety pin into the glue. Let the glue set before you use it.
Attach the yarn to your hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches in multiples of 10.   In other words, the foundation chain can consist of 10 chains, 20 chains, 30 chains, 40 chains, 50 chains, etc. The length of your foundation chain will be the final length of your project. At the end of your foundation chain, work two more chain stitches to serve as a turning chain for your next row.  Half double crochet once into the second chain from your hook.   When counting chains, do not count the loop currently on your hook.  To create the first shell of your first official row, you will need to work a series of treble crochets and half double crochets.   Skip four chains in your foundation. Work nine treble crochets into the fifth chain. Skip another four chains in your foundation. Half double crochet once into the next chain.  Repeat the previous step across the full length of your foundation, stopping only once you reach the end of the row.   This completes the first official row. If desired, you can change yarn colors after the end of your first row. Doing so is not necessary, though.  Chain three, then work one treble crochet into the front posts of each of the next four stitches. Keep the last loop of each treble crochet on the hook.   After the last treble crochet, yarn over the hook and pull the yarn-over through all the loops on the hook. Chain four again. Work one half double crochet into the next stitch in the previous row.  Work a series of treble clusters, chains, and half double crochets across the entire second row, stopping before you work the last five stitches.   For each group:  Chain four. Work a front post treble crochet into each of the next four stitches, leaving the last loop on the hook after each one. Half double crochet once, then work another four treble crochets across the next four stitches. Leave the last loop on the hook after each stitch, then yarn over and pull it through the all the loops on your hook after the final stitch. This counts as a nine-stitch shell cluster. Chain four. Work one half double crochet into the front post of the next stitch.  Chain four, then work a treble crochet into the front posts of each of the final five stitches in the row, keeping the last loop on the hook for each one.   Yarn over and pull through all the loops after completing the last one. This completes the row. Chain four, then turn the work over.  Work four treble crochets into the top of the first cluster, then half double crochet once into the next half double crochet.   Create connecting shells across the entire row, stopping just before the last cluster. For each connecting shell:  Work nine treble crochets into the center of the next cluster. Half double crochet into the next half double crochet.   For the final cluster of the row, work five treble crochets into the top of the cluster. You can change colors at the end of this row or keep going with the color you currently have. At the end of this row, you should also chain one and turn the work over.  Work one half double crochet into the first stitch, then work a series of nine-stitch cluster shells across the rest of the row until you reach the end and finish the row.   For each group:  Chain four. Work a nine-stitch shell cluster over the next nine stitches, following the same procedure used to make the nine-stitch shell clusters in your second row. Chain four. Work one half double crochet into the next stitch.   At the very end of the row, chain one and turn the work over.  At the start of the fifth row, half double crochet into the first half double crochet stitch. Work across the rest of the row using a series of treble crochets and half double crochets.   For each connecting shell:  Work nine treble crochets into the center of the first cluster. Half double crochet into the next half double crochet.   Continue until you reach the end of the row. If desired, change colors at the end of this row.  You've completed a full set of Bavarian crochet at this point. Repeat rows two, three, four, and five until the project reaches your desired width.   If you're changing colors, do so at the end of each odd numbered row.  When your project is finished, cut the yarn, leaving a tail 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off and finish the work.   Weave the secured tail into the back of the work to hide it.	Work a foundation chain. Half double crochet at the start of the next row. Create the first shell. Work additional shells across the row. Front post treble crochet at the start of the next row. Create treble clusters along the entire row. Work a partial cluster at the end of the row. Work treble clusters and half double crochets across the third row. Create nine-stitch cluster shells across the fourth row. Connect the shells across the fifth row. Repeat as needed. Fasten off.

If using seeds, plant them in small seed-raising trays or punnets using seed-raising mix. During germination, keep the soil moist and in a warm, bright but shady position. Increase the sun exposure gradually prior to planting in the garden.   If you prefer to use cuttings, take these towards the end of summer. Avoid woody growth; look for mature green growth and take cuttings of about 10 centimeter (4 in) in length. Place in sandy soil to strike, keeping the soil moist. As with the seeds, bright shade is the best positioning while the roots develop. Rooted layers can be dug up and replanted. You'll see roots developing where stems touch the ground.; , Rue grows best in cool and warm climates, but it doesn't like humidity during summer. If you're in a cool climate, ensure that it has a position with full sun. In a warmer climate, a little shade is fine but not too much.  Rue likes poor soil but it must be well drained and deep. Sandy or gravelled soils are the best choices.   If the soil is too rich for the rue, its growth will be excessive.  A deep watering every two weeks is best from mid-autumn to mid-spring. During summer, water only if it gets very dry; let rain do most of the watering.   Don't fertilise. Rue doesn't need it.  Prune if it looks untidy. Cut back to the main plant shape in early spring.	Purchase rue seeds or seedlings. Select the growing space. Prepare the soil. Water deeply. Prune.
Fold a baby wipe in half lengthwise or vertically, then in half once more crosswise or horizontally. You should have a neat little square wipe.          By folding the wipe, you give it extra layers, making it more resistant to tearing and shredding. Having a thicker wipe also gives you a little more power than a thin wipe would. This method is not necessarily the most effective one, but most baby wipes contain cleansers that are gentle on the skin yet strong enough to wipe away big messes left by little ones, so they can generally tackle spray paint, as well.  Use firm, even pressure to scrub the folded baby wipe over the skin, back and forth, passing over all areas of the stain as you work.          Once one side of the wipe is too covered in paint to be of use, unfold the wipe and flip it around to reveal a new, clean side. Continue unfolding and refolding the baby wipe in this manner until the entire thing is covered in paint.  If you got a lot of spray paint on your skin, one baby wipe probably won't be enough. You can repeat this method as needed, however, until all the paint does eventually lift off.	Fold the wipe into a small square. Scrub the paint off. Repeat as needed.

When determining what to charge, it helps to know what you spent. In addition to material costs, be sure to account for the time you spent making your items, and the cost of setting up displays to sell them. This will help you come to a reasonable minimum price you can set to be sure you don't feel cheated when you sell.  If you'd like to get a better idea of what to charge, investigate the competition. Try to get a sense for what the average selling price for similar items is. This will give you a range to work with, one that might very well increase your profit margin considerably.  If you make anything that can be consumed, such as soap, bath salts, wine, or food, offer small samples to customers who pass by. If your wares can speak for themselves, customers are much more likely to come back and buy them later.  No matter what you make, follow the rule of three to keep your customers happy: Each item costs a certain amount, but if you buy three items, you get a decent percentage off. Typically, the discount is between 20 and 30%, but you can decide for yourself based on the profit margin you've already set for yourself. You can also offer discounts for specific sets of items, such as “two jars of jam and a box of homemade cookies for $10 instead of $12.”   People love to buy in gift sets. Have gift packaging ready for all your items, and larger specialty packaging for groups of two to four items.  These days, with the Internet everywhere, it's easier than ever to learn how to make your own crafts. Stand out from the pack by establishing a presence in the market and making yourself known.   Make social media accounts for your business, and give it a memorable name. Post regular updates related to the items you sell. Speak with local business owners about carrying your products on commission, or helping stage a community event to generate business for all of you. Be proactive and establish yourself as a businessperson to get the support of the business community. Provide relevant supplies to community causes. If a local children's organization is planning to make gift baskets, offer to supply some basic homemade soaps; make a weekly donation of home-canned (and properly licensed!) soup or jerky to a soup kitchen or regular church meal. The more you attach your name to positive actions, the more highly people will regard you and your crafts.	Keep track of your expenditures. Shop around. Offer samples. Offer set discounts. Market aggressively.
If you plan for this to be a total switch, keep in mind that you may go from the first chair clarinet player and one of the best players in your band to the last chair tenor and weak link of the band for a while, and you'll be learning everything but reading music all over again. If you think you're up for it, though, go ahead and proceed.; , Purchase or borrow a tenor sax in decent condition and all the things necessary to play and maintain it. If you're in a school band, the school will probably have an instrument that you can rent, or you can rent one on a rent-to-own program at your local music store. You will also need a method book or two, preferably the same one you used to learn the clarinet., Put the neck strap on, pick it up, and just walk around with it to get a feel for the weight, size, and different angle of the mouthpiece. Figure out where your fingers are supposed to go. The right hand should be obvious, but there are 5 mother of pearl keys on the upper part of the instrument. Your fingers go on the second, fourth, and fifth ones, in the same way they would on the clarinet. Think of the first one as the A key on the clarinet, and the third one as the little lever that you use to play low Eb and high Bb., If you study a fingering chart for the tenor sax, you'll see a lot of similarities to the upper register clarinet fingerings. For instance, thumb, register (octave, on the sax), and five tone holes produces a high E, just as it would on a clarinet.   The key above the thumb key is the octave key, which makes notes higher, just like the clarinet's register key, except it takes them up a whole octave, hence the name. If you finger an E and hit the octave key on the sax, you get a high E, unlike the clarinet, where all the fingerings have two names. The three keys at the top of the instrument are operated by your left hand, and are mainly used for notes above the staff (D, D#, E, and F). There are four keys with rollers between them that are operated by your left pinky finger, about the same place as the 4 "left pinky" keys on the clarinet. On saxophone, this is commonly referred to as the "table," or "spatula keys." L - R: Two bottom keys with rollers (see below), offset key, three aligned keys. View from in case.]]There are four keys on the side of the bottom of the sax that are operated by your right hand. Three are in a row, and one is nestled further in. The top key is used in conjunction with the left hand side keys, and plays high E. The middle one is used as a trill fingering for middle C, and the bottom of the three aligned ones is used for one fingering of Bb. There are two keys at the bottom of the sax with rollers between them that are operated by your right pinky. The top one makes an Eb, and the bottom makes a low C. Think of them as the equivalent of the top two of the four keys at the bottom of the clarinet.  You'll soon pick up on the many similarities and will be playing simple music within just a few minutes. Different methods start with different notes, but most suggest starting with the higher notes. As a starting point, you might want to try the notes below. Many simple tunes can be played with only E, D, and C, and F and G just add to the fun. You'll notice how most of these fingerings are the same as the ones for the upper register of the clarinet.   Top space E: Octave key and first five mother-of-pearl keys. Fourth-line D: Octave key and all six mother-of-pearl keys. Third space C: Only the second mother-of-pearl key (covered by your left middle finger) Top-line F: Octave key and first four mother-of-pearl keys. G on top of the staff: Octave key and top three mother-of-pearl keys.  Releasing the octave key on the G, F, E, and D fingerings produces the same note, but an octave lower. Pressing the octave key for the C sounds a C, but an octave higher.  As you experimented with the fingering chart, you may have noticed that the octave key doesn't seem to be "working." When you finger a D, the sound is the same with or without the octave key. This is common with clarinet players switching to tenor. It'll take some practice to be able to play low notes well, but it's also considerably due to your embouchure. A clarinet requires a tight embouchure, but a tenor saxophone requires a looser one. Adjusting the position of your tongue in your mouth is crucial to gaining full range on the saxophone. The tongue placement varies based on the range, for example: when playing low notes, your tongue will be low in your mouth. The tongue rests in the middle part of the mouth when playing in the middle and high ranges. When teachers say "Drop your jaw for low notes," this is really what is going on; the placement of the tongue and the jaw coming off of the reed permits it to vibrate at a lower frequency. You may also need to adjust the amount of lip you have rolled over your teeth. Saxophone experts generally say that about 2/3 of your bottom lip should be rolled in. Experiment and practice until your low notes sound as good as your high ones.  Over time, you'll be just as good at the saxophone as you are at the clarinet.	Be sure that you really want to switch to tenor sax.  A used tenor saxophone in its case with all the things needed to play and clean it.]],  Assemble a Tenor Saxophone|Assemble the saxophone]]. Familiarize yourself with the keys and fingerings, and see how they relate to the clarinet's mechanism. Play a few notes -- you'll need a fingering chart for this. Adjust your embouchure. Once you've gotten good at the tenor sax and made the commitment to stick with it, ask your director for tenor sax music and start practicing.
These are usually located on the top of the dryer, although they may be located else, depending on the brand and model of your dryer.   Look around the dryer for a slide in/out filter. It may be covered by a door of some sort. Look for a very small outer door or hatch, it is usually rectangular.; ,,, Pick off any remaining lint pieces that may be stuck in the corners.  Alternatively, reuse the lint.  Be sure it is completely dry before going to the next step.	Locate where the lint filter is. Open up the door or hatch, if there is one.  , Pull out the filter.  , Roll up the lint, and peel off. Dispose of the lint. If there is a tough spot, then rinse and gently scrub. Inset the filter back into the dryer, then close the cover.
Some equalizers are designed for installation in your dash while others are designed for a remote location such as the trunk. The installation location will depend on your particular choice of equalizer and preferences.   Many prefer to install their equalizers in their trunk near the amp so that they have the option to easily add additional amps later. Some vehicles will not have space in the dash for an equalizer and will need to remote-mount their equalizer. Equalizers can be installed anywhere between your amp and receiver. Most remote-mount equalizers will come with a remote so that you can change the controls from the driver’s seat.  Most people prefer to mount their remote-mount equalizer in their trunk near the amp. This way they can easily add additional amps later on by connecting a close wire. Other possible locations include under a seat in the vehicle.   Remember that wherever you mount your equalizer, you will have to run wires to your head unit, or receiver, and amplifier.  To run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again, you'll need 2 sets of RCA cable (the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and CD players).   The length of the RCA cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer.  Remove your receiver from the dash so that you can access the wires behind. Usually you can pull off the plastic piece covering the dash and then pull the receiver slightly out.  Plug the two RCA cables into the receiver’s preamp outputs. Tape them together so they will not come apart.  Route the cables through the dash to the equalizer. You should use tape or wire ties along the way to connect the two cables together. Plug the cables into the preamp inputs on your equalizer., Do not mount your equalizer directly to the metal chassis. This will interfere with the sound. It is better to mount the equalizer on a platform or some kind of rubber material to prevent interference.   If you must bolt the equalizer directly to the metal chassis, then you should use rubber pieces between the equalizer and the vehicle.  Turn off your ignition completely and remove your keys before you begin installation. This is for your safety while you connect the wires to avoid getting shocked.  On your equalizer you will see three wires. The black one is the ground wire. Remove a bolt near the equalizer mounting location and scrape away any paint covering the location around the bolt. Crimp a ring on the end of the wire and bolt this to the vehicle.   If there is no location available then you will have to drill a hole in the chassis. Be very careful not to damage the gas tank or brake line while doing this.  The yellow wire (could be red or another color- check your manual) on your equalizer is the 12V power cable. Connect this cable either to the power cable attached to the receiver or to a 12V variable power source in the fuse box (such as the wiper fuse).   If your receiver does not have a wiring diagram to show which wires are switched power cables, then you should use a digital multimeter to identify the correct cable. Connect the multimeter to the cable when the key is in the off position and make sure the voltage reads at zero. Then turn the key into the on position and see if there is now 12V. If the wire follows this pattern then you have found the correct switched 12V power wire.  Splice the wires together and wrap the exposed metal with electrical tape completely. This prevents the exposed areas from touching other wires and potentially shorting the system. You can also crimp the wires together but this is not as strong as splicing. This wire will need to be routed from the receiver to wherever the equalizer is mounted.  This wire will usually be a blue wire with a white stripe, and should be labeled on your equalizer. On the receiver should be a blue (usually blue but can be other colors) wire that goes to the amplifier. Connect this wire to the blue wire on the receiver after routing it through the vehicle from where the equalizer is located.   Splice or crimp the wires together to make a connection and then wrap the connection in electrical tape.  Put the key in the ignition and turn it to the “on” position. Then turn on the radio to check that everything is working well and that the equalizer turns on with the radio.  Put the receiver back into its bracket and place the frame covering back into place. Be sure all the wiring is pushed inside the dash beforehand.	Use this method to connect an equalizer to your car stereo in a remote location for additional space. Decide where you would like to mount the equalizer. Purchase 2 pairs of RCA cables. Remove your receiver from the dash. Connect the RCA cables to your in-dash receiver. Bring the cables to the equalizer and plug in. Mount your equalizer to the vehicle. Turn off your ignition. Connect your ground wire. Connect the power cable. Connect the remote turn-on wire. Test the equalizer by turning on the car. Replace the receiver.
If a car is entering a controlled-access highway, the car on the on-ramp must yield to any vehicle on the highway. When an access road intersects with a highway exit ramp, drivers on the access road must yield to cars on the exit ramp, even if the traffic leaving the freeway merges into a separate lane.  If you are taking a left turn into a parking lot or onto another road make sure you always yield to oncoming traffic. Don’t expect the traffic to stop for you. Wait until there is a safe gap in the traffic for you to turn.  This is self-explanatory. Yield signs will pop up all over the place at strange intersections and at rotaries. Yield to the oncoming traffic if a yield sign is in place. You will often see yield signs to the right of traffic signals if there is a separate lane that turns right before the light. Follow the signs directions.	Yield the right of way to oncoming traffic on highway exit ramps. Yield the right of way to oncoming traffic during a left turn. Yield the right of way at any yield sign.

In the event of an emergency, many services like electricity and water that are often taken for granted may become unavailable. To ensure your survival, have clean food, water, and supplies ready to go at a moment's notice. Make sure that every member of your family knows where to locate these supplies in case they need to be grabbed quickly. In addition to sterile food and water, you will want to include the following in your emergency supplies:   Torch/Flashlight First aid kit Money Simple clothing Blankets  , You and anyone you live with should have a plan to quickly get to safety at a moment's notice. Every member of the house should know exactly what to do and where to go when an earthquake hits. They should know the 'safe' spots in your house - under sturdy tables and against interior walls, especially in corners. They should also know the 'danger' spots in the house - near windows and hanging objects, e.g. mirrors and paintings.   Conduct practice drills every 6 months or so to ensure you and your loved ones know exactly what to do in the event of an earthquake.  If one of your family members is hurt in an earthquake, basic knowledge of first aid can be a life-saver. Take a basic first-aid course and become CPR-certified so that if the worst happens, you'll be ready to save lives.  Earthquakes can sever a house's pipes and/or damage electrical lines, creating situations that can easily become deadly. Be ready to turn off your house's utilities after an earthquake to preserve your safety.   When you turn off the gas after an earthquake or during a drill, DO NOT try to relight the gas pilot. This can cause the gas to leak and cause a fire. Call the utility company and ask them to do it for you.  To minimize the risk of injury or damage in the event of an injury, keep any dangerous possessions, like breakable objects, heavy objects, flammable liquids and hazardous liquids, away from places where they are likely to fall or spill. Keep these things in safe, secure locations away from the designated safe zones in your house.	Have emergency supplies stockpiled. Have a survival plan for your home. Learn first aid and CPR. Learn how to shut off the water, the electricity and the gas. Keep dangerous objects in a secure cabinet or on lower shelves.
Get a car that has many safety and navigation tools. Anti-lock brakes and stability control features will make you a smarter and safer teen driver. They buy you extra time in the event of a potential accident. Even a well working defroster can improve your visibility.You can find the safety rating of most vehicles by entering the year, make, and model information into an auto website, such as Edmunds.  Keep your tire pressure at the proper levels. Get an oil change as often as your owner’s manual recommends, usually 3,000 miles. Check that all of your fluids, like power steering, are filled up. Wipe off your mirrors and windows to improve visibility. Taking good care of your car can make it easier to be a safe driver.It sometimes helps to keep a journal on your phone or a paper notebook in your glove compartment listing dates and information for all maintenance performed. Enrolling in a roadside assistance program, like AAA, is a great way to protect yourself in case you have a breakdown.  Before you set off on a trip, check your gas gauge. Try to keep your tank at least a quarter full at all times. This gives you enough gas to make it through bad traffic safely. Your car will also run better when it’s not running on fumes.	Select a safe car. Perform regular maintenance on your car. Make sure that you have enough gas.
The effect you wish to achieve will influence which painting method you choose for painting your porcelain knobs.   Consider using craft paint designed for use on porcelain if you want the original color of the knob to show and you want to paint a design on the knob. Craft paint is available in liquid form that requires you to use a brush and in marker form which may make detail work easier to execute. Look at fabric and wallpaper designs for inspiration. If you want to paint a pattern on your porcelain knob, small scale designs will work best. Plan to use a combination of primer and paint if you want a uniform finish and color on your porcelain knobs. You can use latex, acrylic or oil paint over the primed knob, and this provides you with a greater option of colors and finishes to choose from than if you use porcelain craft paints. You can also use spray paint over primer in addition to brushing on the paint of your choice.  If you choose to paint a pattern or design on the knob, sketching out the design to scale before painting can help you produce a more uniform and professional looking result.   Measure the diameter of the porcelain knob you want to paint. Draw a circle on the graph paper with the same diameter. You can use a compass and pencil if you are not comfortable sketching the circle freehand. Divide the circle into quadrants by drawing 1 vertical line and 1 horizontal through the center or the circle. Sketch out the design you plan to paint on the knob.	Decide on a color and design for painting the knob. Sketch out your chosen design on graph paper.
Carefully untwist the top of a wire hanger with pliers. Press and fold the wire hook to make it tight enough to fit down the drain. Use this handmade snake to remove gunk and hair from clogged drains., Unwind a wire hanger using pliers until it is straight, then loop one end around the end of your cable wire to hold it. Drill a series of small holes into the wall to reach behind the drywall. Snake the wire hanger and cable through until it reaches its destination., Use pliers to untwist the wire, then reform it into a circle. To make a small skimmer, leave one third of the length of the wire as a handle, or attach a separate, stretch out hanger as a handle to make a larger one. Stretch one leg of an old pair of pantyhose over the circle and tie it firmly to make the net of the pool slimmer.	Make a drain snake. Use a wire hanger to run cable behind a wall. Make a pool skimmer.
Lift the lid off of the tank and set it aside on a flat, stable surface. You’ll now have access to the flushing mechanisms inside the tank. Take note of the water level inside the tank. If it seems excessively high or low, the issue may be a faulty flapper or fill valve.Be careful not to drop the lid or set it somewhere that it might fall. Toilet tank lids are made of ceramic and can break fairly easily. The water in the tank should ordinarily rest an inch or two below the fill valve and overflow tube (the large open pipe near the center of the tank).; , Locate the external water valve on the wall behind and beneath the toilet. Rotate the oblong knob clockwise as far as it will go, then flush the toilet. After it flushes, the tank will not refill itself. This will allow you to work inside the tank unobstructed.Keep turning the knob until you hear the water stop running. You should not attempt to adjust or repair any of the mechanisms inside the toilet tank without first emptying it.  Look over the flushing mechanisms to see what kind of condition they’re in. In particular, you’re looking for the toilet tank’s float, which will appear as a plastic ball attached to a long arm at the top of the fill valve. The height of the float determines how much water remains in the tank after it refills.Make sure the float is properly connected to the fill valve and fill valve and overflow tube are both above water level. If you notice any obvious damage or defects, you might need to call a professional to have the part repaired.  Directly on top of the fill valve you should see a single screw. Turn this screw clockwise one full rotation. This will elevate the float and permit more water to enter the tank before the fill valve closes, increasing the water level in the toilet bowl as a result.You should only make minor alterations to the height of the float. Doing too much at once could cause the toilet to flush inconsistently or create other new issues.  Turn the water to the toilet back on and give the tank a minute or two to fill up. After you’ve flushed the toilet, observe the water level in the bowl. Ideally, the bowl should be about halfway full. If the water in the bowl still looks low, try adjusting the float again until yo get it right.Raise the float about half an inch at a time, then perform a test flush. If there’s is still an inadequate amount of water in the bowl after adjusting the float, call a plumber.	Remove the toilet tank lid. Turn off the water supply to the toilet. Examine the float and fill valve. Use a screwdriver to raise the float height. Flush the toilet to test the water level.
Take a photo of your pet then find a small frame with a hook so that you can hang it on the tree. During the holiday season craft stores will probably have small decorations that you could even glue to the frame- like foam stickers.; , Just have a member in your family hold the animal or get the animal to stand next to someone in the picture. This will show that they are a part of your family.  For example, you could have your dog wear a Christmas collar or put a red ribbon around your fish tank. This just adds decoration to them and the room.  While everyone is opening presents, give your pet a gift, such as a bone for a dog or a toy for a cat. It is also fun to wrap your gift for a dog, sometimes they will even unwrap it themselves.  If you live where it snows, then just take your dog outside to play with it. Or just spend a little time with your pet inside on Christmas giving it special attention, even if it's just a belly rub.	Make an ornament with their picture on it. Include them in your family's Christmas card, if it is possible. Make them appear more festive with holiday decorations. Give your pet a gift. Play with your animal around the holidays.
You can purchase sheet metal at any home improvement store.   Sheet metal typically comes in a variety of pre-cut sizes. Choose the size closest to the size you will need. You will likely have to cut it to size or have someone at the store do it for you. It should be about the thickness of a sheet of poster paper. If it’s too thick, it will be very difficult to cut and be more expensive. Be sure you are not buying sheet aluminum! They look similar, but aluminum is not magnetic.  Transfer the horizontal and vertical measurements from the reference marks you made on the door onto the sheet metal, and draw lines where you will cut.   Use a Sharpie® ,as it will easily make a solid line on the sheet metal. You can wipe it off with window cleaner later.  Cutting your metal requires a pair of tin snips, usually under $10 at your home improvement store.   Put on your leather work gloves, because cutting sheet metal creates very sharp edges. As you cut with the tin snips, chances are your hands will come in contact with a freshly cut edge. Cut your metal as you would cut a sheet of poster board with scissors. Go slowly and do not completely close the tips of the tin snips at the end of each “snip,” as this tends to create a sharp “tooth” along the cut line. Complete the vertical and horizontal cuts and carefully discard the excess.  Use a file to remove all sharp edges along both surfaces of the metal.   Also, slightly round the sharp corners. Very carefully, feel the edges to make sure they are smooth.  Before you attach the sheet metal panel, clean the interior surface of the cabinet door and the mounting surface of the sheet metal.   It is likely that the sheet metal is treated with an oily film when it comes from the factory, and adhesive will not stick properly to oily or greasy surfaces. Use a household window cleaner to clean metal and the cabinet door.	Buy your sheet metal. Transfer your measurement to your sheet metal. Cut the metal with your tin snips. File sharp edges down. Clean the interior surface of the cabinet door.
You’ll need pieces of sturdy timber to construct your boxes. Make sure the wood has been pressure treated or preservative has been applied to it. This will help your garden box to last longer.   If you are using reclaimed wood such as railway sleepers, check that they are plant safe. Some wood can be contaminated with chemicals that will negatively affect plants.  These kits consist of pre-measured lengths of wood and all the fixings you need to fit them together. The kit also may only include just the fixings.   If you purchase only the fixings, you’ll need to source the wood yourself.  If the planks aren’t wide enough to provide enough depth to the boxes, you may wish to double up and make your box out of two planks stacked together on each side.  If you aren’t using a kit, you’ll need to source your own fittings. You can either use chunky posts, which will sit within the boxes so that you can nail into them at right angles, or metal fixings such as right angled brackets. Get four (or eight, if stacking planks to make a deeper box) of whatever fixing you use.   You’ll also need some nails to fit your fittings, and a drill or manual screwdriver.  You can also make garden boxes using bricks or construction blocks. You can also repurpose old items to make garden boxes. These include old bed frames or furniture such as wooden chests of drawers. You may need to drill drainage holes in some of these repurposed items. You can purchase woven willow walls or use metal sheeting, sandbags or logs to make the walls of your garden box.   Just make sure that whatever you use is water resistant. Wooden items will probably need to be treated with wood preservative to prolong their life in the garden.	Get sturdy timber. Consider buying a kit to make your garden box. Get four pieces of timber to build a square or rectangular box. Purchase your fittings. Consider using repurposed items to make a unique garden box.
Get lost in an adventure by using a book to stir your imagination. Curl up on the sofa or in the bed and have a mini-adventure in your head. If you’re not interested in fairy tales or fiction, there’s always non-fiction.   If you don’t care for reading, write in your journal to express your thoughts instead.  There is so much to see and do on the internet. Read the news. Read blogs or websites, or make a blog or a website yourself. If you want something more interactive, shop, play games or discover other things to do.  There are so many ideas to learn and contemplate. You can watch alternative news, or watch a tutorial on how to do something. Or, you could simply entertain yourself by watching a show published on the platform or one of the many YouTube content creators on virtually any subject you can imagine such as beauty, comedy, books, fashion., Ted and Tedx brings speakers together to discuss a variety of topics. Usually, the talks are about 20 minutes or less, and the topics vary from everything to linguistics to design. Watch talks and learn from authors, researchers, scientists, designers and many others.	Read a book. Surf the internet. Watch YouTube. Watch a Ted Talk.
The position of the power button will depend on your model. Usually you’ll find this button on the left or right side, in one of the corners of the keyboard. Volume knobs or buttons are usually labeled and are positioned off to the left or right as well.  Many Casio keyboards have a small LED near the power button. When the keyboard is on, this light turns on to indicate it has power.If your keyboard isn’t turning on, check the power cord. The keyboard won’t turn on if it’s unplugged or the cord is loose. If your keyboard is battery powered and it won’t start up, you may need new batteries. Replace these and see if the keyboard turns on.; , The default for most keyboards when they’re first turned on is piano, but electronic keyboards can synthesize many different sounds. Use the number pad (usually to the right) to change the sounds made when you press a key.  Most keyboards will have an instrument directory written somewhere near the keypad. This will list instrument names (like organ, trumpet, and so on) and their number.If your keyboard doesn’t have an instrument directory, look up the instrument numbers in your manual. If your manual is missing, Casio offers free electronic manuals online., The features your Casio has will largely depend on its model. Older keyboards may have few features, but newer ones may have programmed lessons, auto-chord features, a metronome, and more.   Programmed lessons often make use of a keyboard light-up feature, where keys change color to indicate which you’re supposed to press to play a song. Auto-chord features will make simple chords off a single note. This can be a fun way to learn simple chord structure.  Especially in the beginning, you’ll be focused on hitting the right notes, hand position, and so on. You’ll be coordinating a lot of new motions, so it may be difficult to get a good sense of how it all sounds together without listening to a recording.   The record button on most Casios is red and will be labeled with "Rec.” Generally, press this button once to start recording and again to stop. Recording features will vary from model to model. Your keyboard may even have memory so you can save songs you’re really proud of.	Turn it on and set the volume. Choose the sound you want to play, if desired. Consult your manual to learn keyboard features. Record yourself to improve your playing.
Roses need a lot of water to grow healthy. Don't let the soil dry out; when you see it getting dusty give the roses a deep watering. For established plants, and depending on your region, you'll need to do this about once a week., After they are established, roses should be fertilized a few times per growing season. Use fertilizer (either liquid or granule) in early spring, when you see the first few leaves sprout. Use it again after the first bloom, and again if there's another bloom. Stop fertilizing the roses at the end of the summer, just before Labor Day.Some fertilizers are slow-release, so they don't have to be applied as often. Don't over-fertilize the roses; this can lead to disease. Try cow, goat or manure made of kitchen waste to help them to grow better.  Pruning roses keeps them both beautiful and healthy. The goal is to clear away crowded areas to open up the bush, which helps prevent rotting and disease.The pruning strategy differs according to the season, but the cut you make is always the same: prune just above a bud eyes, the areas where branches form. They look like small circular swells and are usually located above a set of mature leaves. Make a down-slanted cut on an outward-facing bud eye.   It's very hard to over-prune a rose, since new growth is always directed to the next closest bud eye. Keep this in mind when you choose bud eyes to prune, as it will affect the shape of your rose bush.Remember that the key is to prune with an eye toward opening the bush's growth up to allow for air circulation. In the late winter or early spring, trim the dead canes away. Cut away the rootstock, also called suckers, which are smaller offshoots of the main plant that suck away the nutrients from the rosebush. Leave 8 or so canes, trimmed back to 1/3 of their height. This will promote healthy growth as the weather warms up. In the summer, remove deadheads, which are dead blooms. This encourages new blooms to grow.	Water them frequently in the summer. Fertilize the roses. Prune the roses.
You'll be able to find recently released material as well as CD's that were released 20 or more years ago. These CD's will all most likely be in mint condition and the fact that you can actually browse the stock means that you'll be able to spot any faults before you make a purchase. It may not however be an easier way of purchasing rarities.  If you can, call the store in advance and ask if they have the CD that you want in stock, they may surprise you by saying that it is in stock and they may even tell you how many copies they have in stock too. However, they may also disappoint you by saying that it isn't in stock. You can simply ask them if they know when it will be back in stock and hope to purchase it then or simply look in other branches.  Because it is a large business, there CD's should be arranged in alphabetical order as well as music genre and remember that larger stores means larger stock, which means that you'll have a greater chance of finding your CD. Start looking in the appropriate places for your music CD. If you've found the CD that you're looking for, purchase it. If not, ask someone who works there if they have the CD in stock. Remember, that just because you can't see it on display it doesn't means that it's not in stock (this theory best applies to large music stores), they may surprise you and tell you that they do have it in stock.	This is another helpful method which may just about work for shopping for music CD's. You might not want to travel too far so it may be best to start off by visiting a music store that is closer to you. Make a visit to the music store. If all else fails and they tell you that they don't stock it at all (and it's not on their website), you may want to search elsewhere.
It is important that you remember to drag every track that you plan on playing into the software, because unlike Serato, you can not properly play tracks that have not been previously analyzed.; , This is also an important part of staying organized while you are playing.  Another organization technique that will really add to the fluidity of your set. Instead of having to scroll through hundreds of tracks trying to find the song you want to play next, plan your set beforehand and get all of the tracks in order. You won't regret it.  This is very important, because if your beat grids don't follow the beat of the song, it will make beat-matching very difficult.  The same technique won't work for everyone. For example, you might set A-cue at the beginning of the track, B-cue 16 bars from the drop of the track, C-cue 8 bars from the drop, and D-cue 8 bars from where you want to mix the track in., This will help you avoid an occasion where you've loaded a track expecting it to be cued and it wasn't. There will be a small graphic beside each track telling you whether it has been cued or not. ,, Make sure that you see it loading onto the flash drive on the bottom Rekordbox, and make sure you don't remove the flash drive until Rekordbox has finished exporting your crate.  It is easy for files to become corrupted, and sometimes crates might not export in their entirety. It is also possible to experience issues with network connectors on CDJs where it won't load your tracks through all the devices. In that case you would need a flash drive to plug into each CDJ you planned on using. Play it safe, and be prepared for anything.  Flagship hardware can be very pricey so ask around the DJ community, make friends, and share equipment with others. The DJ community is generally a pretty cool bunch so be outgoing, and reach out to people so you never have an issue with finding the right equipment to practice on.  Make sure everything is set to go. Just get there early and be prepared., Make sure to have fun, and if you make a mistake keep playing. Chances are the crowd didn't even notice.	Drag and drop all of the tracks that you want to analyze into Rekordbox. Make a crate, name it, and drag all of the tracks that you want to play into this crate. Organize your tracks in the order that you would like to play them. Go through each of your tracks and check that the beat grids are all in line. Cue your tracks in a way that is convenient for you. Do a run through just to be sure. Insert the flash drive that you plan on using the night of the show into your computer.  , Find your flash drive in Rekordbox.  , Drag your analyzed, and cued crate onto the flash drive. Insert another flash drive and repeat. Get on a pair of CDJs or XDJ set up, and run through your set. Get to the venue early to plug in your flash drive. Throw down a killer set.
This must be a container that is able to hold water. If using a basket, it should be lined with strong plastic or place a ceramic, glass or plastic bowl into it.  Completely cover the oasis with water to make sure it is saturated. This will take about 15 minutes., With a knife, cut the foam to fit into container with about an inch over the containers top., Tape it to the edges with green floral tape so that it does not shift. The foam should fit tightly in the container. If there is too much water, you may empty a small amount out., You are now ready to add the greens you intend to arrange. You can decide how long or how short but it's nice to green a container with the edging longer. You do not have to cover all the foam, just enough that when flowers are in place you will not see the foam after., Make it tall, about 1 1/2 inches in length taller than your container. When working with flowers, always work in odd numbers, so that your center flower is one. Then choose odd amounts of the same flower. Usually do five for this flower., That gives you four. (Cut flowers to length you want piece to hang over.) The fifth flower should be cut a bit shorter than center one, then place in foam next to it., Fill in using space one; do not worry about leaving gaps. You can always fill those in later. You want the flowers to have spaces. Work your way around piece all sides. Do not worry about the piece being all the same all around.  Place flowers at angles. Use bright small flowers for filler.  Here are a few options:  Add small pieces of gypsophila (babies' breath ) and fill in sections. Or, make loops out of ribbon (floral wire the ribbon loops to a wood pic). Place those in between. Some florists use greens (tree fern). Whatever you choose is alright. However, putting in too much of everything is odd.  If not, you may add more water to the container. Check the container every few days to see if it needs more water. Some flowers, like hydrangeas, require a lot of water. Keep checking your arrangement––as long as the flowers are alive, they need water.	Choose a container, vase, or basket. Soak a piece of floral foam (oasis in water). Remove the oasis from water. Make an X to tape down the foam. Find the center to start. Cut the flower of your choice for center. Add the same flower as in the center to each side of the arrangement. Begin to add other flowers, always in odds. Fill in gaps. Check to make sure that the foam is still very wet.
Since grinding involves getting very close to your partner, people grinding will be gathered in a packed crowd. These groups most often form in the middle of the dance floor. If you need a partner, start there., When you find a potential partner, glance at them twice. Offer a smile. Don’t stare. Someone who is interested in you will give you a sign, such as returning your glance and smiling.If you want to dance with someone you know, such as your significant other, you can avoid searching for a partner.  Work your way over to potential partners. At low-key dances or when you’re not already dancing, simply walk over and ask for a dance. At a club, you can set the mood by dancing over to them and monitoring how she responds. Ask them for a dance. If they turn away, move on.   Out on the dance floor at a loud, packed club, you may get someone’s attention by gently touching their shoulder. Keep in mind that this can be offensive to some people. Remember to check the area around your potential partner for significant others or protective friends. Avoid this trouble and approach someone else.  Out on the dance floor, you may see groups of people grinding together, usually a mix of men and women. It’s not unusual to see two women “sandwiching” a man, grinding against him from both sides. This is a simple way to help you find a dance partner or start grinding with a new partner.  When you start dancing, time your moves according to the song. Some songs are better for grinding than others. These are usually upbeat, energetic songs instead of slow dance songs. No matter how you grind, keeping to the beat helps you dance better.  Many front grind moves are less intimate than grinds from behind and are good when you or your partner don’t want to get too close. Face your partner. Flex your back so that your chest bumps into theirs. Move your body backwards and repeat., Stand face to face with your partner. Start by sticking your chest forward as you would in a bump. Let the rest of your body move forward gradually all the way down to your pelvis like a wave is running through you, then repeat the move., Hip rolls are similar to back grinding, except you face your partner. Move one side of your hips forward towards your partner. Roll your hips in a circular motion to the other side, back, and around., Wait until they turn around and start dancing with you. Grind dancing is sensual, so putting your hands on your partner’s hips is often a good move, but you need to make sure first that they’re okay with this.   Leave your hands on their hips and go no further. Don’t assume that this is anything more than a dance. Unwanted touching is still inappropriate.  Bend your knees slightly and sway side to side at first. Follow your partner’s lead. Often, grinding starts by both you and your partner moving in circles. Keep your knees bent as you move your waist around in a circle.  If you’re dancing with a stranger, they may not be comfortable with full-on contact. One way to grind in spite of this is to lean. Stand directly behind your partner. Lean in the opposite direction they lean, then dance as usual.You’ll know your partner is uncomfortable if they seem hesitant or pull away from you. It’s better in this case to lean away or move back a little so you apply less pressure.  A normal grind dance is about being close to your partner. Get close enough to them while dancing so that your hips press against theirs. The more comfortable your partner is with you on the dance floor, the more willing they will likely be to increase this contact. Allow them to take the lead if you’re unsure if you should press more.  It wouldn’t be very fun if you stood there and moved your hips in a circle for an entire song. To make the dance better, try changing your moves. Stay close to your partner but add in a move such as dipping from one side to the other. Use your hands to help guide your partner’s hips.	Search for a crowd. Use eye contact. Approach your potential dance partner. Join a grinding chain. Move to the rhythm. Do chest bumps. Try moving in waves. Use hip rolls. Place your hands on your partner’s hips. Move your hips. Lean to the side. Keep up the pressure. Change your rhythm.
The length will vary depended on how long you want your bookmark to be. However, remember that the finished bookmark will be much shorter than the original length of the lace strips.  Make a loop. Push the ends of the strips underneath, and pull them through the loop. Pull tight. , Continue until you're about 3 inches (7.62 cm) from the bottom   Add ribbon or other decorations to the braid if desired. Leave longer than 3 inches at the bottom if you want a tassel.	Cut three equal sized pieces of leather lace. Tie the strips together at the top: Hold the strips together with the tops even. Place the knot underneath something heavy or have someone hold it, so that it doesn't twist while you are working.  , Braid the leather strips together by doing a basic braid. Do the same knot you did in the beginning.
Follow the shape shown in the image of the following step to help you design an eggplant shape template on pattern or brown paper. The shape is a little like a kidney bean, only not as steeply dipped in the center. The size is up to you; consider how many coins you're likely to want to carry and how much room you have in your handbag. It is recommended that you keep the length under 20cm/7.8" and within 10cm/3.9" width to keep it compact.  Cut out the template in readiness for use on the fabric.; , Pin the paper template to the fabric in readiness for cutting. Then cut as follows:  2 pieces of external fabric following the eggplant template; this will be from the colored cotton fabric 2 pieces of plain cotton fabric lining 2 more pieces of plain cotton fabric for lining.  Draw simple leaf shapes (see the image above as guidance) on paper. Cut out the template, pin to the felt and cut out four felt leaves., Face the right side of both fabrics together and pin in place. Stitch together, all the way around apart from the mouth end (the end the purse opens from)––leave an opening about 4-5cm/1.5-2". Then turn the external part of the bag inside out., Sew the cotton fabric lining pieces together, using the same method. Leave an opening with length of 4-5cm/1.5-2". Then, place the lining fabric bag inside the outside fabric bag. Stitch together all the way around, apart from the open mouthpiece.  Adjust the shape to neaten as needed. Then glue on the four felt leaves, cascading down each side of the mouth. Use a decorative stitch, such as blanket stitch.  Insert the mouth opening into the gap of the purse frame, carefully aligning it over the mouth stitching and maybe just a little part of the leaf ends if they come up that high. You may need to wiggle the material a little to fit it properly., Gluing is a little faster but can be messier and less durable, while stitching requires a little extra effort but will likely last longer. Here is how to do both ways:  For gluing, use a fabric glue. Be careful not to overdo the glue––wipe away any excess glue immediately or it might dry as a noticeable blob. For stitching, use an embroidery needle that is thin enough to fit through the hole. While holding the frame and the purse fabric together with your other hand, insert the needle from the wrong side of the purse about 5mm/0.19" away from the fabric's edge into the second hole of the frame to start. Then insert the needle into the first hole. From here, insert into the third hole from the wrong side again, then sew back into the second hole. Repeat the stitching for the rest of the frame in the same fashion. Pull firmly after each stitch, to ensure smooth and even stitches from both sides. Knot well when you reach the end. Pliers can be used to squeeze each end of the purse frame to prevent it from moving off the purse; if so, cover the frame with a piece of scrap fabric before applying the pliers, so as to protect the frame's finish.  Your eggplant purse is now ready for use.	Draw a basic template on paper. Cut the pieces of fabric. Cut the leaves from felt. Sew the outside fabric pieces and plain cotton lining pieces together. Sew the body of the bag. Turn the bag over. Attach the purse sew-on frame (the opener for the purse). Glue or stitch the sew-on frame to complete. Done.
Until now, we've discussed guitar tunings that are useful for people playing guitar with a pick or their fingers. However, these aren't the only ways to play a guitar. For instance, many blues songs make use of a special tool called a slide which is essentially a short glass or metal tube that fits over the guitarist's index finger on his fretting hand. The slide allows the guitarist to glide effortlessly between notes on the fretboard for a characteristic "fluid" sound (a good example of this is the opening lead melody of the famous Lynyrd Skynyrd song "Free Bird"). Though it's possible to play with a slide in any tuning, because of the slide's rigidness, tuning to a style where the strings make a chord when strummed in the open position makes it much easier to play with a slide. In this section, we'll tune our guitar to open D, one of the most common of such tunings for slide guitar.          For great examples of slide guitar playing in open tuning, check out "Goin' Down to the River" by Mississippi Fred McDowell or "Catch Hell Blues" by the White Stripes (the latter is in open A, rather than open D tuning).  As noted above, you can use a variety of options here — pianos, tuners, pitch pipes, and online tools all work well.  Tune the A string to the tone made by the 7th fret of the low E string and, after that, tune the D string to the that of the 5th fret of the A string. This will tune the top three strings of your guitar to D, A, and the D one octave above the first D, respectively.          You may have noticed that this tuning preserves your ability to play easy power chords on the first three strings. While this is true, power chords aren't necessarily things that are common in traditional slide guitar music.  For the last three strings, open D tuning begins to differ from drop D tuning. Tune the G string to the 4th fret of D, rather than the 5th, as is customary. By doing this, you tune the G string to the note F#.          As a reminder, tunings for slide guitar tend to form chords when all six strings are strummed together in the open position. The notes in the D major arpeggio are D, A, and F#. By tuning the G string from a G to an F#, this ensures that all of the strings will sound a chord when strummed together.  Next, we'll do something that we haven't had to do so far: tune a string to the third fret. As noted above, we want all of the notes in our open D tuning to belong to the D major chord, whose notes are D, A, and F#. By tuning the B string to the 3rd fret of the G string (which is now tuned to F#), we make it an A, which is a note that is in the D major chord.  Finally, finish tuning to open D by tuning the last string as you always have so far. Strum the 5th fret of the B string, then strum the open E string and tune it so that it matches the tone perfectly. Though we're tuning it exactly the same as before, because the B string is now tuned to A, we're actually tuning the high E string to D, rather than E. This is a good thing because, as explained above, the note D is in the D major chord.  You're all finished! All that is left is to test your handiwork by playing your guitar, preferably with a slide to take advantage of the open tuning (though this isn't absolutely necessary). Slip the slide onto the index finger of your left hand and strum all six strings in the open position with your right hand. Gently press the slide against the strings and strum again. Ideally, if your guitar is in tune, you should hear a major chord that's in tune with itself. Let the notes ring and move the slide up and down the neck. The chord should smoothly shift in pitch as you move the slide. It may take some practice, but eventually you should get the hang of playing in open tuning with a slide.          If you don't own a slide, you can usually get away with playing with any similarly smooth, round object. For instance, the neck of an empty glass bottle works well.	Grab a slide for playing. Tune the low E string to D, as for drop D. The first few steps of tuning to open D are essentially the same as those for tuning to drop D. You'll want to begin by tuning your guitar's low E string to a D reference tone. Tune the A and D strings as you would for drop D. Next, you'll want to tune the following two strings exactly as you did for drop D tuning. Tune the G string to the 4th fret of the D string. Tune the B string to the 3rd fret of the G string. Tune the high E string the 5th fret of the B string. Play to test out your work.
Spray soapy water on the outside of the window and cover it with one of the black trash bags. Smooth the plastic flat.; , Ammonia fumes can be harmful and different individuals will respond differently to exposure to the fumes.  When left under the hot sun, the garbage bags will absorb heat, helping the film peel off in one piece.  Use your fingernail or razor blade to lift the window film in a corner of the window, and try to peel the film off in one entire piece. Be careful not to cut the defroster lines. Keep the tint moist with ammonia as you strip. Use a razor blade to scrape off any tint that did not peel.  Remove the exterior trash bag, and clean the window thoroughly with glass cleaner.	Cut two black garbage bags in roughly the shape of the window. Protect all inside surfaces near the window with a tarp: speakers, rear light, and upholstered surfaces, then spray]] or wear a face mask. While the ammonia is still wet, trap the ammonia against the window film with another trash bag or plastic wrap.constructed of multiple layers of film. Start peeling the window film. Remove any residual adhesive with ammonia and very fine steel wool, then wipe the surface with a paper towel before it dries.
Species that thrive in the soil pH that occurs naturally are more likely to do well, especially trees, but the pH can be adjusted to suit a particular plant.; , If the plants are already growing and have developed chlorosis or yellow foliage, the pH should be checked and adjusted immediately.  Chlorosis can be caused by a variety of things including too little or too much direct sunlight, herbicides, insect infestation and unusually extreme temperatures but it is most often caused by a deficiency in iron.Even if the sufficient iron is present in the soil, which it usually is, if the pH is too high the plant is unable to absorb it.   Chlorosis is indicated by leaves that become pale green or yellow. When the pH is not adjusted immediately, the foliage dies, branches become stunted and flowering plants may not bloom.  To determine if the soil is acidic, neutral or alkaline, a quick test can be done before purchasing a soil pH test kit.Take 1 tablespoon of soil from the garden and let it dry.   Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a pan with a lid. Put 2 cups of chopped red cabbage into the boiling water, cover the pan and let it continue to boil until the water changes to dark purple.  Let the water cool. Measure 2 tablespoons of the purple water into a white saucer along with 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda.   Stir the baking soda into the water until it changes color.  It should be blue or green, indicating that the water is alkaline. Use a dropper to add clear vinegar to the water one drop at a time until the water changes color again.   It should be red, indicating the water is acidic.  Use the dropper to add enough purple cabbage water to thoroughly wet the soil. Tip the saucer from side to side for one minute. Hold the saucer at an angle so the water runs to the side of the soil and note the color of the water.   Blue or green, the same color as the test sample after baking soda was added, means the soil is too alkaline for most plants. Red, the color of the test sample after adding vinegar, means the soil is too acidic. If the color of the water drained from the soil is purple or purple-blue, it means the soil pH is neutral to slightly acidic which is ideal for most plants.  The soil sample collected for testing with the pH test kit should not be taken from the top because the roots of most plants are at least 2 to 4 inches below the top of the soil. The pH may be slightly different at the top so the sample should be taken from where the roots of the plant will be absorbing moisture and nutrients.   Soil samples from areas where grass and annuals will grow should be collected from 2 to 3 inches deep. Soil samples for shrubs, trees and perennial plants should be collected from 4 inches deep.  Human hands can alter the soil sample pH. Use a hand trowel or dirt shovel to dig away the top 2 to 4 inches of soil.   Collect 1 to 2 tablespoons of test sample soil, remove any pebbles or debris and place the soil in a clean bowl to dry overnight.  After the sample dries, crush it up by hand or with the back of a spoon until it is loose and fine-textured.  If the pH needs to be checked in different gardens in the yard, take a sample from each garden. The pH can be different in one part of the yard than it is in another. This is especially true of soil along a house foundation where lime tends to leach into the soil from the concrete and raise the pH.  Fill it only to the soil line indicated on the test chamber. Pour the test powder over the soil.  Fill it only to the water fill line indicated on the test chamber. Place the cap on the test chamber. Make sure it is tightly sealed.   Shake the test chamber vigorously to thoroughly mix the soil, powder and water.  Hold the pH chart provided in the kit up next to the test chamber to determine the soil pH.   Do the comparison in bright indirect light to get the most accurate reading. Direct sunlight can make the solution appear slightly lighter.  However, you should collect 1 whole cup rather than a couple tablespoons. Allow the soil to dry and crush it up. Pour the soil into a large, clean container with a lid that seals tightly.  Shake or stir it vigorously for a minimum of one minute. Let the soil and water mixture sit undisturbed for up to 24 hours until the soil settles to the bottom.  Fill it only to the water fill line on the chamber.   Use only the water without disturbing the soil at the bottom of the container.  There will be a different chemical for nitrogen, phosphorous and potash.   For example, the chemical used to test for nitrogen may be purple, the chemical for phosphorus may be blue and the chemical for potash may be orange.  Let it sit for 10 minutes to allow the color to develop. Check it against the chart in bright indirect sunlight to determine nutrient levels.  Thoroughly wash and rinse the test chamber between tests. If the test indicates that one of these nutrients is high or already at acceptable levels, use a fertilizer that does not contain that nutrient.  Fertilizers list the ratio of nutrients as Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potash or N-P-K. If nitrogen levels in the soil are at an acceptable level, use fertilizer with a ratio of 0-10-10 or something similar.   When plants get excessive amounts of nitrogen, they will either grow excessive amounts of stems and foliage or the roots could be burned.If it is a flowering plant, it will put on lush new foliage but may not bloom. If nitrogen levels are low but phosphorus and potash levels are acceptable or high, use fertilizer with a ratio of 10-0-0. Phosphorus helps plants bloom and potash helps them develop strong stems and improves their ability to absorb and utilize sunlight.  Digital soil analyzers make testing your soil a little easier. They are available at garden centers and online.  Loosen the next 5 inches of soil with a shovel and pick out any hard clumps of soil, stones, sticks or other debris.   Pour distilled water over the soil until it is muddy and pack it down by hand to remove any air pockets.  Polish the analyzer probe with the polishing cloth provided the analyzer, running the cloth from the tip to the meter then wipe it again with a cotton ball to remove any dirt or residue.   Do not polish or wipe the tip of the probe.  Use the arrow button on the analyzer to select “pH” or “Fertility,” depending on what you are testing. Insert the probe 4 to 5 inches deep into the wet soil. If it does not slide in easily, pull it out and insert it in a different spot.   Do not force it into the soil as this could damage the probe.  Wait sixty seconds, pull the probe out of the soil and check the digital read-out on the meter.   If the read-out is 7 or above, wipe the soil off the probe with a cotton ball and repeat the test, inserting the probe in a different spot in the mud and leaving it in for 30 seconds. If the initial read-out is below 7, wipe off the soil and repeat the test, leaving the probe in for 60 seconds. The digital read-out from the second test is the actual pH or fertility of the soil.	Check the pH and nutrient levels of the soil before planting trees, shrubs, perennials or annuals. Consider checking the pH if your plants keep getting diseases. Check your pH if you suspect chlorosis. Do your own at-home test before purchasing a pH test kit. Pour the purple water into a bowl through a colander to remove the pieces of cabbage. Take note of the new color. Place 1/2 teaspoon of the dry soil in a clean white saucer. Dig a bit deeper to get your soil sample. Wear gloves when collecting and working with the samples. Smooth out the soil sample. Take samples from a few different areas if the garden or yard is large. Put the soil sample into the test chamber included in the test kit. Add distilled water to the test chamber using a dropper. Set the test chamber down and wait for a minute or two until the soil settles back to the bottom and the watercolor changes. Collect samples for nutrient levels at the same depth as those for pH. Pour 5 cups of distilled water into the container with the soil. Use a dropper to fill the test chambers and reference chambers in the container provided with the kit with the test sample water. Put the test chemical into the water. Seal the test chamber tightly and shake it vigorously. Do a separate test for nitrogen, phosphorus and potash. Pick out your fertilizer. Consider purchasing a digital soil analyzer. Remove the top 2 inches of soil at the test site with a dirt shovel. Wear rubber gloves to avoid altering the soil pH with your skin. Turn the analyzer on. Twist the probe back and forth in the mud a few times to insure good contact with the soil.
Pour the flour and the salt into a large bowl. Stir them together with a spoon until they are well-mixed.      ; , This is not completely necessary, but it will add a little extra sparkle to your finished piece. Start with a spoonful, then add more as desired. You can use extra-fine scrapbooking glitter, or chunky, crafting glitter.   Keep in mind that, if you paint the handprint later, the glitter will get covered up. If this concerns you, save some glitter so that you can mix it into the paint later.  Pour a little bit of warm water into the bowl, and stir it together with a mixing spoon. Keep doing this until you have a dough-like consistency. You may or may not end up using all of the water.         Add a few drops of food coloring into the water if you want a pastel color. Mix 1 part water, and 1 part acrylic or tempera paint if you want a bolder color., As you continue to knead the dough, it will become smoother and less sticky. If you added paint or food coloring to your dough, be careful; the color may stain your hands!        , It would be easiest to do this with a rolling pin, but if you don't have one, you can use a glass, bottle, or jar instead. You want it to be about ½ to ¾-inch (1.27 to 1.91-centimeter) thick.  You can keep the fingers close together, or have them spread apart. Press your hand (or your child's hand) into the dough. You want to press firmly enough to make a print, but not so firmly that the dough becomes paper-thin.          Consider adding a name and date. This is a great idea to help you remember your little one's first Christmas, Thanksgiving, or other holiday.  Here is where you can get really creative. You can cut the handprint out as a circle, square, or oval. You can also cut out a glove shape instead. If you are careful, you can even trace around the hand, leaving a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border around the hand.  You can make the hole using just about anything: a straw, toothpick, skewer, lollipop stick, or even a knitting needle.  If you colored your salt dough earlier, be aware that the color may fade as it dries. You can still paint the salt dough after it dries, however. Place the handprint on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then do one of the following:   Leave the handprint out in a warm place for a few days. If the handprint is very thick, you may want to turn it over every so often; this will help it dry faster.Bake the ornaments in the oven at 215°F (100°C) for 2 to 3 hours.If the handprint is very thin, check on it after 45 to 60 minutes., You do not have to paint the handprint, but it can help make it look more unique. Keep in mind that the paint will cover up any glitter you added into the dough. If this bothers you, mix a little bit of your glitter into the paint you are using.          Use some metallic or glitter paint for something extra special. If you carved in a name and/or date, you could fill the letters in with paint and a thin paintbrush.  There is no such thing as too much glitter! You can paint the entire handprint with a thin layer of white school glue, then shake some glitter on top of it. You can also draw designs using glitter glue pens instead.          If you can't find any glitter glue pens: draw some designs using white school glue, then shake some glitter onto the glue. Gently tap off the excess glitter when you are done. If you don't want to add any more glitter, then you can skip this step.  You can do this using a decoupage-type glue, such as Mod Podge. You can also seal it with a paint-on or spray-on acrylic sealer. This will help make your handprint last longer.         If you added glitter, make sure that you use a glossy finish, or you will dull the glitter's sparkle.  You can glue these on using hot glue or white school glue. You might not want to cover up the handprint, but they'd look lovely glued around the border!  , You can use baker's twine, jute string, yarn, or even satin ribbon for this. Match your string to the style of the handprint. For example, if you made a rustic-looking handprint, yarn or jute string would look great. If your handprint is glittery and sparkly, with lots of gemstones, try gold or silver ribbon instead.  Keep your fingers close together when making the handprint. Cut the "tree" out leaving a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border, and poke a hole near the top for the ribbon. After the dough dries, paint the tree green, then add red and gold ornaments using your finger tips (or a Q-tip if you don't want to get messy). Don't forget to add the trunk! Once the paint and sealer dry, thread a red, green, or gold ribbon through the hole.For an extra special tree, dye the dough green and add some green glitter first. Use a darker shade of green when painting the tree.If you like sparkly things, glue on red and yellow gemstones for the ornaments instead of painting them.  Make your dough and handprint first. Cut the handprint out so that it is shaped like a mitten. Next, use a star, heart, circle, or square-shaped cookie cutter to cut out a hole in the palm. Make a hole near the top of the handprint, then let it dry. Once the dough is dry, glue a photo to the back.Consider adding the person's name and the year which the ornament was made.  Keep your fingers apart when making the handprint. Cut the "bird" out leaving a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border. Make a hole just above the thumb for the string. Let the dough dry, then turn the handprint sideways so that the thumb (quill/crest) is at top and the fingers (tail feathers) are to the side. Here are some ways in which you can paint your bird:   For a cardinal: paint the palm area red, and the thumb and fingers a dark red. Add a black eye just below the thumb. Don't forget the orange beak and black feet! Blue jay: paint the palm area white, and the thumb and fingers blue. Add a black eye just below the thumb. Don't forget the black beak and feet! Robin: paint the palm area red, and the thumb and fingers a grey or tan. Add a black eye just below the thumb. Don't forget the yellow beak and black feet!  , Keep your fingers spread apart when making the handprint. Cut the "turkey" out with a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border. Make a hole just above the fingers for the string. Let the dough dry. Keeping the hand upright, paint the handprint as follows:   Paint palm and thumb brown. Paint the fingers red, orange, and yellow. Add a beak and eyes to thumb. Add feet to bottom of the palm.  Keep your fingers apart when making the handprint. Cut the handprint out, either as an oval, or with a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border. Make a hole just above the fingers, then let the handprint dry. Paint the handprint as follows:   Paint the palm brown. Paint the fingers and thumb light brown or tan. Paint some eyes near top of palm, or glue on a pair of googly eyes. Paint a red or black nose near bottom of palm. If you'd like, you can add a smile too.	Mix together 2 cups (200 grams) of flour and 1 cup (300 grams) of salt. Consider adding some glitter into the flour mixture. Stir in the warm water, a little bit at a time, until you get dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly-floured surface, and finish kneading it. Roll the dough out. Make a handprint. Cut the handprint out. Make a hole near the top. Bake the handprint in the oven, or let it air dry. Paint the handprint using acrylic paint or tempera paint, if desired. Consider adding some glitter. Seal the handprint once the paint dries. Consider adding some gemstones. Thread some string or ribbon through the hole, then tie it in a knot. Make a Christmas tree. Make a frame if you like keepsakes and memories. Make a bird if you love nature and animals. Make a turkey for Thanksgiving. Make a reindeer for Christmas or winter.
You'll need a spot that gets at least 6 hours of good sunlight a day. Choose a spot that's not crowded with the roots or branches of other plants and trees.The soil should be loose and have good drainage; if yours has a lot of clay, loosen it and add some gypsum pellets before planting.   Roses do best when the soil has a pH of 6.3-6.8.To determine whether a site has good drainage, walk around it after a good soaking rain. If the soil is damp, but not waterlogged, it should be fine. If you see puddles or large mud spots, you'll need to find another site or work on this one to make it more conducive to growing roses.  If you're planting bare roots, soak them in a bucket of water for a few hours before planting. If you're planting a rose you bought in a pot, water it thoroughly before you prepare the planting bed.  You'll need one for each rose bush you're planting. Use a garden spade or shovel to dig a hole 18 inches (45.7 cm) wide and 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep. The measurements don't have to be exact, but a hole this wide and deep will be suitable for most roses. Mix the soil you removed from the hole with compost, and use some of it to form a small mound in the base of the hole. Add some bonemeal or rose fertilizer.   If you're planting more than one bush, allow several feet of space in between, so the roots have room to grow and stretch.  Place the bare root or potted rose on top of the mound. Use a shovel to fill the hole back up with soil. The rose's bud union should be located about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the surface of the ground. If you live in a colder region, you may need to plant your roses deeper to protect them from low temperatures.If you're planting a potted rose, loosen the soil around its roots to expose them before planting it in the hole. Make sure the soil is firm around the roots; press down with your hands to remove any air pockets.  Thoroughly watering the area where you planted the rose helps compact the soil against the roots, stabilizing the plant. Make sure it gets a good soaking right after you're finished planting.  Place mulch over the area where you planted the rose. If you planted a potted bush, place the mulch around the stem. This will keep the temperature consistent and protect the roses during the early stage of growth.	Decide on a planting spot. Water the roses to prepare them for planting. Prepare a large hole. Plant the roses. Water the roses. Add mulch to the rose bed.
If you have gone a few days to a week without rain, your forsythia could use a drink. Spray it down with a garden hose until the soil feels and looks damp. The shrub does not like frequent drenching, but it can tolerate a little excess water better than it can tolerate a long period of dryness.   Note that extra watering may not be necessary during spring, autumn, and winter, when you are likely to receive precipitation regularly. If you have a particularly dry summer, though, extra watering will likely be needed.  To promote all around strength, use a light fertilizer with a 10-10-10 formula, meaning that it has equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Alternatively, you can use a 10-20-10 fertilizer, which contains a higher dose of phosphorus, to encourage brighter, more vibrant flowers.  Forsythia is fast growing, so even if you prune a lot at once, the foliage and blooms grow back quickly. New flowers grow on old growth, rather than new, so you should cut the branches down as soon as the flowers begin to wither. Cut at least 1/3 of the oldest branches down until they are about 4 inches (10 cm) from the ground. Try to prune according to the shrub's natural shape to keep the forsythia looking its best and fullest.  Forsythia plants are not prone to many problems, but a wayward pest or fungal disease can strike if the conditions are right. Treat the plant with pesticides and fungicides only when needed, however, since you do not need to worry about taking preventative measures.	Water the forsythia during periods of drought. Fertilizer the plant every year in early spring. Prune the shrub aggressively. Watch out for pests and disease.
A studded leather bracelet requires strips of tooled leather, assorted studs, an x-acto knife, a hammer, a snap-on clasp, and scissors.  Wrap the leather strip around your wrist, and add an additional inch to the measurement. Use the scissors to cut the strip to length, and cut off the corners to round off the ends.  Take your studs and arrange them how you like over the leather bracelet. When you've gotten them just where you want them to be, gently poke the leather with the prongs from the stud. Doing this will not pierce the leather, but leave a small indent.  Use the x-acto knife to cut small slits where the prongs indented the leather. These cuts need only be wide enough for the prongs to be inserted through; cutting them too wide will show up on the finished project.  Slide each of the studs through the slits you have cut. The prongs will stick out the back end. Twist them around just how you like them before securing them in place.  Flip the leather strip over and use your hammer to bend down the prongs. If there are two prongs on the back of each stud, hammer them down in opposite directions.  To create the clasp, add the snap-on buttons to either end of the bracelet. These may have prongs that can be slid through the leather and hammered down like the studs, or they may need to be glued in place.  Use the snaps to secure the bracelet on your wrist. Adjust any studs that may have gotten twisted around or moved out of place. Your bracelet is finished! Show off your new style by making several and stacking them.	Get all your supplies. Measure and cut the leather. Place the studs. Cut slits for the studs. Add the studs. Bend down the prongs. Add the buttons. Try on your bracelet.
Cut two one-inch pieces of velcro. Attach one piece to the underside of the front of the track, and another piece to the underside of the other end of the track. Make sure you don't attach the velcro to the plastic tab piece.  Cut the belt into two strips: one to wrap around your forearm, the other to wrap around your wrist. Attach velcro pieces to the insides of the straps so that they fasten snugly around your forearm and wrist.  Remove the adhesive backing from the velcro pieces on the tier and attach the tier to the two belt straps. Remember to position it so that the blade point should be directed toward your hand, away from your body.  Strap the blade to the underside of your forearm by attaching the belt at your upper forearm and wrist. Arrange the keyring around your middle finger and make a fist with your hand.          Hide the blade under a loose long-sleeved shirt. Make sure it's positioned so that it won't cut your hand or clothes.  Point your arm away from your body and open your hand. The keyring will pull the fishing line, which will trip the blade and send it springing forward. When you let go of the keyring, the blade will retract.	Attach velcro strips to the underside of the tier. Make belt straps. Attach the straps to the hidden blade. Put the blade on. Discharge the blade.
Again, using the wrong fuel can be an issue. Not only can it cause knocking by igniting at the wrong time, it can also leave excess contaminants in your cylinders as a result of poor combustion.If you are now using the proper fuel, you may need to clean out the contaminants left by past fuels.  While most fuels have a specified amount of detergent in them (at least in the US), this may not always be enough to keep your combustion chamber clean. Using top tier gasoline brands will provide more detergents that help keep your engine clean.Another way to clean your cylinders is to add a detergent to your fuel. This is as easy as buying a fuel additive at your local parts store and pouring it into your gas tank at your next fill up.This step is very simple. Just choose an additive and follow the directions on the bottle for putting it in your gas tank.  If detergent hasn't gotten your engine running right, you can try an engine flush such as Seafoam. The flush reacts with the carbon deposits to remove them from your intake system, including the combustion chamber.Be aware that, when starting your engine for the first time after the flush, there will be a lot of smoke.  Start the engine and listen closely. Your knocking engine should be running smoothly now.	Consider cleaning your cylinders. Use a fuel additive. Flush your engine. Test your car.
They should be about shoulder width apart.Lift your heels up off the ground. Then push your heels back down onto the ground, bending your knees slightly. Your hips will now come forward, followed by your ribs and chest.  This is one of the most important parts of this key dance move.If you don't roll your shoulders forwards and then look down, you aren't completing a full body wave. This move is very fluid, and should be performed with the beat. The next part is to reverse the move and return to starting position.  As you do this you should lift your heels off of the ground.Follow this by waving your chest and belly back. Roll your hips back next. Push your heels back to the ground.  From here, you can do this body wave move again or incorporate other street dance moves, like popping and locking, into your routine.Remember to have fun. Street dancing is a vibrant and energetic type of dance. The order and sequence of your moves don't necessarily matter so much in street dance. Freestyling is preferred over pre-planned routines. Don't be afraid to add your own arm movements or additions to each move. Be creative!	Start with your feet apart. Roll your shoulders forward, then look down. Roll your shoulders back and lift your head. Ground yourself in starting position.
Before you can paint an exterior door, you need to clean it, sand it, and prime it, and this requires some tools. For this project, you’ll need paint and primer (if you’re not using a pre-primed, metal-clad door). Some products nowadays contain both paint and primer in one. Also:   220-grit sandpaper Screwdrivers Caulk Solvent, such as mineral spirits (for metal doors) Sponges or rags Painter's Tape Painting tray Stir sticks Small foam roller and frame Small to medium brush A cut-bucket; , Insert a flathead screwdriver between the hinge and the hinge pin. Angle the screwdriver upward at a 45-degree angle, and tap the end of the screwdriver with a hammer. As you tap, the hinge pin will come out of the hinge. Pull the hinge pin out from the hinge. Repeat with the other hinge. Loosen both the hinges and remove the door.Have somebody else holding the door as you remove it from the hinges. When you have the door off, lay it horizontally on a bench or across two sawhorses. It’s also OK to paint or stain the door while it’s still hanging. In that case, you’ll need to mask off the hardware or cover it with a painter’s rag.  Use a screwdriver to remove any hardware from the door that will come off. This includes handles, knockers, the hinges, mailboxes, and the latch and lock mechanism.It will make painting much easier and faster if you don’t have to paint around these things.   You'll most likely need a Phillips or flathead screwdriver to remove the hardware.  If there are any holes in the door, such as nail marks, fill these in with small amounts of bondo or wood filler. Go over the door and locate holes and cracks. When you find one, inject some filler into the hole to fill it. Smooth down the filler and press it into the hole or crack with a putty knife or scraper.When you’ve filled all the holes, set the door aside to let the filler dry. Read the manufacturer’s directions for exact times.  To give yourself the cleanest surface possible, clean the surface of a metal door with a mild solvent like mineral spirits to remove dirt, grime, and old paint residue. Soak a rag in mineral spirits or another solvent and rub the surface of the door.This step is not necessary if you're painting a wooden door.  To give the new paint a good surface to adhere to, it’s important to rough up the surface of the door with sandpaper. This will also help remove any dirt and residue from the surface. Go over the entire surface of the door with 220-grit sandpaper, making sure to get all corners, nooks, and crannies.   If you're painting a metal door, sand before cleaning it., Before you can paint the door, you must clean it to remove dust and dirt. Use a small brush attachment and vacuum the door, including all the recesses and corners.Take a slightly damp cloth and wipe down the entire surface of the door to get rid of any dust that the vacuum missed. Set the door aside and allow it to air dry for about an hour. If you cleaned a metal door with solvent, wash it with water mixed with a few drops of dish soap. Rinse the door and allow it to dry before proceeding.  You need to protect features that cannot be removed, such as windows. Cover the window or element with newspaper, and then tape the paper in place with painter’s tape.   Make sure the tape or paper covers every surface that you don’t want painted. If you left the door on its hinges, tape adjacent walls, the frame, and the hinges. You can use a drop cloth, too, if you have one handy.  You need special paints for exterior surfaces, because outside doors will be exposed to many more elements than interior ones. Your best bet for paint is either a water-based acrylic or latex paint, or an alkyd-based oil paint.   Water-based paints tend to dry faster than oil paints, but oil paints will provide better protection for the surface underneath.If you currently have a water-based paint on your door, you'll have to paint over it with the same type of paint. The same goes for oil-based paints – you’ll need to cover it with another oil-based paint. Make sure the paint you choose is specifically formulated for exterior surfaces.  Before you paint the door, you'll have to apply a layer of primer that will help the paint get better coverage and adhere to the surface more easily. You can use an oil-based primer with oil- and water-based paints. The best is to apply an oil-based primer followed by a latex paint.For primer color, choose a neutral color or a lighter version of the color you're painting the door.  The ideal day for painting will be above 50 F (10 C). Also, if you're painting outside, choose a day when there's no direct sunlight hitting the door. However, make sure it’s not raining either, and that it’s not too humid or too windy.If it’s too cold when you paint, the paint won’t dry. Wind and sun can cause the paint to dry too quickly, and humidity can prevent it from drying properly.  Open your can of primer and stir it with a paint stir stick. Pour some primer into the paint tray. Use a brush to paint the trim around one of the recessed panels. Then use the roller to paint the panel. Repeat until all the recessed panels have been painted. Use the roller to paint the rest of the door, including the top, sides, and bottom.If your door is one flat piece of wood or metal, use the roller to paint the entire door. When the primer has had enough time to dry (usually a couple hours), flip the door over and paint the other side.  Fill a clean paint tray with your paint. Use the brush to paint the trim on a recessed panel first, then use the roller to finish the panel. When all the recessed panels have been painted, finish the door with the roller.Give the paint many hours to dry before flipping the door over and painting the other side.  If you need to paint a second coat, follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding drying time. In general, you should always wait a full day before applying a second coat.  As soon as you’ve finished painting the final coat, remove the painter’s tape that was protecting windows and adjacent surfaces. Peel the tape off by pulling it toward yourself at a 45-degree angle.   It’s important to remove the tape when the paint is still wet, otherwise the paint may dry to the tape and peel off with it., Before replacing hardware and rehanging the door, it’s important that the door have time to fully dry. Otherwise, you may dent, smudge, or peel off the paint.   Read the paint can for proper drying times for your specific paint. For most paint, you may have to wait about two days before you can rehang the door. Generally, when the paint no longer feels tacky to the touch, the door can be reinstalled., Once the paint has dried, reattach all the hardware before you rehang the door. This includes handles, knockers, mailboxes, and anything else that was affixed to the door before painting.  As soon as the hinges are back on your door, you can put the door back into place. Slide the door back into the frame and align the hinges. Drop the hinge pin into place, and tap it down with a hammer or the handle of a screwdriver to secure it in place.   You may find it easier to have someone else help you with this. One person can hold the door in place and the other can put in the hinge pins.	Gather your supplies. Remove the door from the hinges. Remove the hardware. Fill in holes. Clean metal doors. Sand the door. Vacuum and wipe down the door. Tape and paper hardware and windows. Choose a paint. Pick a primer. Choose the right day to paint. Prime the door. Paint the door. Apply a second coat if necessary. Remove the tape. Allow the paint to dry fully. Re-install the hardware. Rehang the door.
If you are using whale ivory, make sure it was harvested before 1972, when the Marine Protection Act outlawed whaling in America. You can also use old ivory piano keys, bone or white acrylic., Insert a pin into the front and secure the pinhead inside the knife. , If possible, attach a disk to a Dremel tool and apply the beeswax to the disc. Then, apply the beeswax evenly to the surface of the ivory, coating it completely.   Why seal the ivory? Ivory is very porous. Sealing keeps the ink that’s tattooed into the ivory from spilling over into unwanted sections, leaving an inky cloud. When properly sealed, the ivory will absorb ink only into the grooves that you etch into it.  Rub the wax cloth over and over against the ivory until it has a uniform surface.  The ivory should look shiny but not feel very waxy. Set the beeswax cloth aside, since you will need it later.  You will want a small detailed drawing to use as your scrimshaw design.  Remember to leave one-half inch of space on all sides. A sketch-like image with good outlines and some shadowing is best for scrimshaw. , Cut it out, so that you can align it with the edges easily.  Wet a cloth with acetone nail remover. Rub it lightly over the top of the paper with the cloth and then with a bone folder.   Make sure the paper is completely wet.  You don’t want to move it around on the surface, or it will smudge your outline. Discard the paper.   If the outline didn’t come off onto the bone clearly, you can sand it, wax it and start again., Begin applying pressure while holding the pin as vertical as possible. Etch the lines into the surface of the bone., Then, apply some ink to the surface with a cotton swab. Apply a generous amount, and then wipe it off the remaining surface with a lint-free rag.  You can also stipple, by etching dots. The closer the dots are together, the darker the shading will be.  If you want a line to be darker, etch it deeper and apply more ink. , If you make a mistake, you can draw larger lines or you can sand the area, re-wax it and sketch it again. , Wax the surface of the scrimshaw when you are done by spreading an even layer over the artwork. It should appear shiny and preserve your ink.	Shop around old salvage yards or thrift stores for small pieces of ivory. Buy a pen-like X-acto knife with a replaceable head. Get some good quality beeswax, black, brown or blue ink and some acetone nail polish remover.  , Apply beeswax to the surface of the bone or ivory to seal it. Use a cloth and work the beeswax into the surface by hand for five minutes if you don’t have a tool with which to apply it. With a clean cloth, buff the ivory until all the beeswax has been removed. Measure your piece of ivory. Find an image online and shrink it to the size of the object. Print the image on a home computer or copy it from a book to a sheet of paper.  , Place the ivory on top of it and draw an outline of the ivory over the sheet of paper. Place the illustration face down. Lift up the edge of the paper and peel it back quickly. Trace the outlines of the illustration with your pin. Complete the outline of the illustration. Begin shading the drawing by etching crosshatched lines. Apply more ink with cotton swabs and wipe it off. Replace your pin as necessary when it begins to dull.  , Survey your work. Wipe all the extra ink off the surface of the bone.  , Grab your beeswax-covered cloth.
A blizzard-prone area will be different from one in a tropical area that commonly faces hurricanes. Urban areas face different challenges than rural areas.; , If the temperature rises, take anything out of the refrigerator that might spoil and prepare to cook it or consume it before it warms up. Eat perishables before spoilage can occur.  Those that do not require cooking are even better.   Canned meats, fish, soups, vegetables, and juices will work, and can be kept for months at a time. Crackers, cookies and snacks for the kiddies are a necessity. Eat these items after the perishables are eaten or are unsafe to eat. To make perishables last longer, avoid opening the fridge unless absolutely necessary. The air in the fridge will remain cold for a limited amount of time, even after the power goes out. But the more you expose it to room temperature, the faster it will warm up and the faster your food will spoil. You can also minimize heat gain by packing everything in the fridge tightly together.  A camping stove is ideal (and be sure to know how to use it safely — see warnings). A barbecue grill will work quite well, but do not bring it into the house. (You don't want carbon monoxide poisoning.) A gas stove can often work if you have matches for ignition. Remember to have plenty of fuel on hand for your camp stove or barbecue in case your adventure lasts several days.   Water is actually more important than food, and if your water supply is pump-driven, it may give out in a power failure. Put aside many gallons or liters of drinking water. Fill your bathtub or pails with water for flushing the toilet, washing, and so on. Read the article titled How to Get Emergency Drinking Water from a Water Heater.  Do you need to stock up on wood for the wood stove? You should consider buying portable fans, and cold water rinses to stay cool. If your home runs on natural gas or propane, install a gas fired fireplace that has its own thermopile electronic ignition. Should you get a gas-powered generator?  , Many of the commercial style emergency lights look pretty bad on the wall of your kitchen or living room, and they typically only last 90 minutes - day or night.   Try to find power failure safety lights that sense darkness before going on. Otherwise the batteries will be dead before darkness comes. New power failure safety lights just hitting the market deliver light for long periods of time because of the improvements in LED brightness and battery life. Look for power failure safety lights on the web and find ones that you can install in any room of your home without being an eyesore. Start with the kitchen and bathrooms - the two most used rooms of the house.  Go to the mall, or take in a movie. Have a few good meals at a nearby diner or at a fast food restaurant.   Unless you are snowbound, or ill, there is no reason to stay indoors and be uncomfortable. There's plenty of time for that when it gets too late to stay out.  A few basic necessities can be plugged into these. Think lights, fans, laptops, cell-phones and radios. Don't expect to power your whole home off of one of these. Some portable power generators can even power your refrigerator.  Turn on your flashlight only when you need to move about. You can make up your own games, sing songs, or practice the ancient art of talking with one another. Be playful if possible.   Read a book to pass the time. Remember, this can only be done during the daylight hours. At night, the best thing is to go to sleep. Time passes faster when you sleep, especially when there is nothing else to do but wait.  These will light a room better than a flashlight. Also, keep a "manual" can opener handy to open animal food cans as well as other preserves.  Cell phones will also lose their charge quickly, so having a battery powered cell phone charger is also a good idea.	Consider the type of emergencies your particular home is most likely to face. Cook perishable foods. Have stable foods that don't require refrigeration. Have a back-up method of heating food and water. Have a back-up method for heating or cooling your home during a blackout, depending on your climate's needs. Prepare by equipping your house with automatic power failure safety lighting so that it does not go dark when the power goes out. Power outages can mean 'get out of the house' during the day if it is safe to do so. If you can afford it, get a powerful Portable Power Outlet like ATOM or a Portable Power Generator. Remember that there will be no TV, no light, and games that need reading will not be able to be played. Keep a battery powered camping "lantern" available. Keep a battery powered radio available to monitor local news and emergency developments.
Cut a length of cardboard so that it's the size and shape of a blade that will fit within the ball bearing track. The end of the "blade" should align with the end of the track. Make two holes in the cardboard that align with the holes you drilled in the ball bearing track.  Trace the cardboard blade cutout onto a piece of sheet metal, including the two holes in the middle. Cut the blade shape from the metal and drill two holes in the middle.  The screws will be too long, so you'll need to cut them down by about half using the dremel.  Place the ball bearing track upside down on your table, so that the ridge parts are facing down and the flat side is up. Lay the blade on top of the ball bearing track so that the screw holes are aligned. Thread screws through the holes and keep them in place with the nuts.  Insert it so that the blade is pointing toward the pinched end of the tier. The ball bearing track should slide in easily; make sure all the ball bearings are in their correct place.  Place the spring over the second screw on the blade. Now replace the black cap and screw it on tight, holding it in place with a nut. This will hold the whole contraption together.  Lay the tier against your forearm and cut a length of fishing line that extends from the second screw on the blade to your middle finger. Make sure it's long enough to wrap around your finger while your hand is in a fist, and add a little extra to make sure you can tie it around a key ring. Tie one end of the line over the second screw, making sure to slip it over the nut so it will stay in place, and tie the other end around a key ring.          Make sure the fishing line is cut to the right length. It shouldn't be too taut, but if it's too loose it won't work. When the ring is around your middle finger and your fist is closed, the line should be snug. When you open your hand, it should pull the blade out. Move the line back and forth to test whether the blade moves easily along the track.	Create a tester blade. Cut the metal blade. Cut down the screws. Fasten the blade to the ball bearing track. Put the ball bearing track back into the middle tier. Add a spring and replace the black cap. Attach fishing line.
, Add it to the bowl containing one cup of water.  Stir the mixture until the sodium alginate has thoroughly dissolved. Set the mixture aside to allow the air bubbles settle and dissipate.  Add it to the bowl containing four cups of water.  This will get rid of the air bubbles.  Use the measuring spoon to drop the sodium alginate solution into the bowl of calcium lactate, as carefully as possible. Continue until you have used the remainder if the sodium alginate solution. Make sure not to place spoonfuls of sodium alginate too closely, as it can fuse together.  Remove the bubbles with a slotted spoon. Place them into the third bowl filled with water in order to rinse them off.	Set out your materials and ingredients.  , Take one gram of sodium alginate. Use the immersion blender. Take five grams of calcium lactate. Stir the calcium lactate well. Add the sodium alginate solution to the bowl of calcium lactate. Stir the sodium alginate bubbles for about three minutes. Finished.
When you first get into a skid, take your foot off of both of your vehicle's pedals.Your first instinct may be to hit the brakes, but this may not always help you recover from a skid.   Slamming on the breaks could make your skid even worse.  Once you've taken your foot off both pedals, determine whether the back wheels have lost traction. If you are fishtailing, or the back of your car is sliding uncontrollably, this is called a loss of rear wheel traction. Gently accelerate to regain control of your car.The goal is to regain traction on your rear wheels before you can start to decelerate.   This is also commonly referred to as oversteering., If you are veering off into a direction and can't stop, it's most likely because you've lost front wheel traction on the road.In this case, you should pump your brakes to regain control of your car, after you take your foot off of the gas pedal.   If you have anti-lock brakes, then you should apply steady pressure instead of tapping the brake. Check your owners manual for information on your car or truck., Turn the wheel into the direction of the skid if you lose rear wheel traction. If it's skidding left, then turn your wheel left. If your rear wheels are skidding to the right, then turn right.Aim to stay on the road, but don't try to force the wheel or overcompensate.  Once you've regained control of your car after a skid, reduce your speed. The reason you went into a skid is either because your wheels have been worn down and no longer have traction on the road, or you were going too fast. To avoid an accident, and potentially hurting someone, slow down and stay alert.	Take your foot off the gas and the brake. Accelerate slowly when fishtailing. Pump your brakes in a front wheel skid. Turn the wheel into the skid. Slow down after skidding.
If you find a stripped hole, place a doorstop under the open door to hold the temporary drop of the weight. Remove the hinge with the stripped hole by removing the screws holding it in place from the door jamb and frame, and if necessary, from the door’s face. Dip an appropriately sized dowel into carpenter's glue and insert it into the hole – you can find these at any large hardware store. When the glue dries, predrill a hole with an appropriately sized bit, then replace the hinge and its screws., If you’ve gone through a basic check and tightened hinges, but your door still sags, your screws might not be long enough. Remove a screw from the top hinge. If it’s not 2 1/2 to 3 inches long, the screw won’t be able to reach the wall stud through the jamb and the door’s weight won’t be fully supported. Remove the old screws and pre-drill into the jamb and wall stud before replacing them with longer ones.Check the level of the door after replacing each screw. When the longer screw catches the wall stud, it should pull the door inward. Make sure not to over-tighten.  Make shims with thin pieces of cardboard, wood, or playing cards to fit between the hinge and jamb and help align the hinge and door. Remove the appropriate hinge, often the top hinge, and trace and cut out its shape from your shim material. Use the thinnest materials possible so you can add layers to the hinge mortise one at a time until the door is level again.You might have to install shims on more than one hinge. This technique involves some guess and check work. Adding or subtracting shims until the door is square might be necessary after each shim adjustment.  Alternatively, you can also “mortise” one or more of the hinges. For this, you’ll need to score an outline around your hinge before removing it. Then, once you’ve taken off the hinge, you’ll carve out a deeper new pocket with a chisel.First, score the outline of the hinges you want to mortise with a utility knife. Remove the hinges. Take the chisel and position it on the scored line perpendicular to the door jamb. Lightly tap the chisel to deepen the scoring a bit. Do the same around the whole perimeter. Once you’ve finished the perimeter, use the chisel to make a series of cuts about 1/8 inch apart. The mortise depth will depend in part on how much the door sags. You want to adjust it so the hinge is mounted flush with the door. Last, hold the chisel flat and tap it to clear out the waste. Replace the hinge	Look for and fill stripped holes. Replace short hinge screws with longer ones. Add shims between the hinge and the doorjamb. Mortise the door hinge.
Decide who you want to teach about the dangers of drunk driving and choose an appropriate venue.; , Certain ages and types of people will learn in different ways.  The statistics on alcohol-related road traffic collision can be shocking and should help to get your message across.There are many resources to do this with, including many scientific journals  , One method suitable for educating groups of high school students is to ask them to look at the people sitting next to them. Each member of the group should then be asked what they think will be the cause of death for those they just looked at. Chances are, in a group of 15-19 year old boys, the most likely thing to kill them will be the person sitting in the middle, especially if they drink and drive.  A conviction for drunk driving could lose a person their job. A family who loses someone to drunk driving will feel the impact of the incident for the rest of their lives.  Hundreds of young girls are killed and injured by their boyfriends' bad, or drunk, driving. Boys show off to girls. Educate girls they have a right to refuse to get into a car with a boy that they think won't or can't drive safely.  There is NEVER any excuse for driving under the influence.  These preventable incidents are a waste of professional resources whose time could be better spent saving lives or preventing serious crime. ,, These should be available through your fire department, council or appropriate government organization.	Identify your target audience. Tailor your lessons to your audience. Research statistics. Use shock tactics if appropriate. Explain the long term and far reaching effects of drink driving. Target young females in particular. Make your audience understand that just because they have gotten away with drunk driving in the past, doesn't mean they will continue to get away with it. Teach your audience that even a minor fender bender caused by drunk driving will need to be attended by the emergency services. Educate your audience about the legal penalties for drunk driving.  , Be a good role model by not getting behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol.  , Use resources such as videos, posters and leaflets. Employ the catch phrase Better late than never—It's better to be sober and arrive later than to be drunk and never get there at all.
Poi can be made by using tennis balls and rope. Put the rope through the ball and tie a knot in the end. Tie a loop in the other end of the rope. You should have two of these. Another option is the use of football (soccer) socks. If you buy poi, then it's advised to start with soft poi (bean-bag style) rather than glow poi which tend to be harder, or fire poi which are very dangerous and should only be attempted after a lot of practice.; , If you have bought poi they will probably have two loops at the end, put your index and middle finger through these.the string should be roughly the same length as your arm. , Keep practicing this trying to keep the movement equally timed on both sides("in beat"). It can often help to practice to music to keep this beat. If possible watch your reflection to make sure the poi are parallel, not crossing in front of you or spinning out.  Practice with one poi first. start by spinning as you have been doing then cross your arm in front of your chest, if possible try not to move the whole arm but focus the movement in the wrist. Mastering this helps to greatly control your movements and is essential for harder tricks. Try to move the poi in a figure of eight shape (practice without the poi first if you're scared of hitting yourself) so it crosses in front of you, circles on the opposite side, then returns to the start.  Then try with both. DON'T cross them in front at exactly the same time or they will tangle up and hit you. Instead, move them across a beat after each other(it helps if you see one as following the other). , Practice these.	Poi can be either made or purchased. Slip the looped ends of the rope over your hands. The ideal place to practice poi is either outside in good weather, or in an open space with a high ceiling indoors.  , Hold your arms down by your sides and swing both poi to get a bit of momentum going, slowly(about a second a rotation, it doesn't sound slow but its very tempting to try to go faster, at which point its harder to control) rotate your wrists so the ball spins forward. WEAVING: the most basic trick. Once you feel you have mastered this repeat with the other poi. This basic weave is the basis of many other tricks so once you've mastered that you're off to a flying start.  , Look online or ask a friend to show you some special moves.
Turn the chair upside down and unscrew the seat from the chair.,  Remove the old seat cover. Lay the fabric for the new seat cover on a flat surface. Place the old cover on top of the fabric. Pin it to the fabric with safety pins or straight pins. Cut around the outline of the old cover.  Remove the old padding from the seat. Lay it on top of the new piece of foam or padding. Use a marker to trace around the old padding. Cut along the marked lines.,  Place the new fabric on a flat surface. The right side of the fabric should face down. Put the new padding over the fabric. Set the seat on top of the padding. Stretch the fabric to keep it smooth. Staple the fabric to the seat. Pull the fabric as you go around to eliminate wrinkles. Fold down the corners of the fabric. Staple them to the seat. You may also leave the corners unfolded if desired.  Screw the seat cover onto the chair. Ensure that the fabric side is facing up.	Remove the seat. Make a new seat covering. Replace the padding. Replace the seat cover. Attach the seat cover.
Try to leave at least three inches of extra thread so that you can successfully secure a stitch without losing the end of the thread.       ; , Keep the garment on a flat surface (like a table) so that you don’t stitch into another layer of fabric, such as your own clothing.  You should also be able to see the length of the nearby stitch you just made.  Insert the needle under the nearby stitch and pull it under the stitch until it forms a loop.          Note: For single or double thread you can alternatively make a loop with only the string itself. Holding the thread in one hand and the needle in the other, loop the thread over the needle and pull the needle through the loop. Then slowly pull the loop down until it is flush with the fabric and tighten it. This will make a knot., Slowly pull the needle through the loop and pull it tight. This will cause the beginning of a knot.          Note: With double thread, you can also take the thread out of the needle (leaving you with both strands of thread hanging from the back of the fabric) and fold the left side of the thread over and back under the right side several times like you are tying your shoes (just the first step of shoe-tying, not the loop parts). Repeat this step several times to ensure the knot is secure.  Cut the extra thread on the outside of the knot so the back of the fabric looks clean and uncluttered. Use very sharp scissors.	Leave some excess thread. Avoid sewing on top of other fabrics. Turn the garment so that the backside is facing you. Make a loop. Use the needle to make a knot. Remove the excess thread.
NAUPA is a non-profit organization with the goal of reuniting property with its rightful owners. The NAUPA website is the best place to start because it provides links to all of the state unclaimed property databases in the US. You can search the database for each state that you have lived in to see if you have any lost money., Using the NAUPA website, search for lost money in the state where you have or have had resident status. If you believe that you may have lost money as a result of the death of a loved one, then you will also want to check with the insurance department in the state where your loved one lived., NAUPA provides the links to other legitimate sources for finding lost money such as the IRS, National Credit Union Association, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and more. Make sure to search all of the sources that are applicable to you., Each state and federal website will have a different process for claiming your lost money. After you conduct your searches, you will need to carefully follow the instructions on the website.   If you are having trouble understanding the instructions, you can call the organization and ask for help. There should be a phone number available at the bottom of the web page or on the website's "contact" page.  If your searches don’t turn up anything and you believe that you have lost money, consider hiring a professional asset detective to locate the funds for you. Just keep in mind that professional assistance can be expensive, so this should only be used if you are certain that you have a considerable amount of lost money.	Go to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators website. Search your state insurance department’s database. Check NAUPA’s “Other Sources For Unclaimed Property” tab to see if there are any other sources of lost money that you can claim. Follow the steps to claim your money. Consider hiring a professional asset detective.
Sketch a horizontal line for the horizon as in the first method.  This point may be located below the bottom of the paper (outside the paper.) You don't need to actually mark the point.  The usual method for this is to sketch a first line from the point of view in a 60 degree angle to the left and mark your vanishing point where this line intersects the horizon.  For this you will draw a second line from the point of view in a 30 degree angle to the right. Again, the vanishing point will be the intersection of this line and the horizon. The 60 and 30 degree angles can be different, but the angle between the lines that go from the eye of the observer to the vanishing points have to form a 90 degree angle. , These lines will determine the proportion of the sizes of the objects when they are located closer or farther from the point of view.   Make light, temporary guidelines with a ruler (shown here in green) to make sure your details are in perspective. Erase these guidelines later.	Determine the horizon in your drawing. Determine the point of view, which is the approximate location of the eye of the person viewing the drawing. Determine your first vanishing point. Determine your second vanishing point. Sketch your main objects drawing the vertical lines perfectly vertical, the horizontal lines moving to the left at an angle towards the left vanishing point and the horizontal lines moving to the right at an angle towards the right vanishing point (all the horizontal lines should converge in one or the other of the vanishing points if extended far enough).  , Give detail to your drawing respecting the trends given by the horizontal lines sketched for the main objects.
Some of the most telling signs that you’re unfit to drive will manifest in your eyes and gestures. Switch up your alertness methods—for example, if you’re listening to audiobook, try switching to an amped-up CD or radio station—if you experience difficulty focusing, excessive blinking, or yawning. These symptoms indicate unsafe levels of fatigue and could lead to more serious issues more quickly than you realize.Detecting these early signs of exhaustion is particularly important because the next step of fatigue—characterized by memory lapses, disorientation, and slowed reactions—is already a dangerous state of impairment which causes thousands of traffic accidents every year., If you catch yourself drifting into the median or shoulder, slamming on the brakes due to a delayed reaction, or missing a stop sign, you are already experiencing dangerous symptoms of over-tired driving. You may not have taken any drugs or alcohol, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t impaired. You should pull over immediately and try to take a cat nap to refresh your energy.If you still feel extremely sleepy after your cat nap, don’t try to force it and continue on the road. Quit while you’re ahead and get a good night’s sleep before resuming your drive.  There are times when even the utmost vigilance, quantities of caffeine, and other alertness tricks simply won't work. If you feel sleepy and strained in spite of all your attempts to perk yourself up, you need to throw in the towel and sleep. Find a hotel, motel, or rest area where you can sleep for a few hours before continuing your drive.If you’re going to stop somewhere, be sure to call a friend or family member to let them know exactly where you are and how long you plan to sleep. That way someone knows where you are and you won’t alarm anyone expecting your arrival.	Be aware of eye stress and yawning. Take a 15-20 minute nap if you notice drifting or other driving errors. Know when to quit.
There are several natural substances that ants abhor so much, they won't go near them. If you use one of these substances to create lines around your windowsills, around the perimeter of your house, and in any spots where ants are getting inside, you can keep ants from coming inside. Freshen up the lines every few days, since ants will be able to get through once the lines are broken. Here are substances that work for this purpose:Cinnamon Cayenne pepper Ground orange or lemon peels Coffee grounds  , This will keep the inside of your house from getting sticky, but the ants will be deterred by a strong citrus smell. You can also squirt a solution of half lemon juice, half water around the outside of your house.  They hate the smell of a variety of essential oils, many of which smell very pleasant to humans. Add 10 drops of essential oil to 1 cup of water, then spray the solution both indoors and outdoors to keep ants away. Here are the oils you can try:   Lemon oil Peppermint oil Eucalyptus oil (don't use this near cats! It's toxic to them, but not to dogs) Lavender oil Cedar oil  , During the spring months, when ants are most likely to come inside the house, do your best to keep your floors, countertops, and cabinets spotless. This goes a long way toward keeping ants out. If they don't smell food, they won't be interested in invading your house.   Keep food containers tightly sealed, too. This is especially important for sugar, honey, syrup and other foods that ants like to eat. Clean up spills right away, especially fruit juice or syrup spills.  If you don't give ants a door inside, they'll be more likely to stick to outdoor areas. Find all the little cracks and crevices where they could be getting in, like under the door, around the windowsills, and in other little cracks in the foundation. Fill the holes with caulk or other sealants to keep your house airtight. Spritz the areas with lavender or lemon water for good measure.	Make a line that ants won't cross. Squirt lemon juice along outdoor edges. Use essential oils to keep ants away. Keep your surfaces clean so ants aren't interested in coming in. Seal your house to keep them out.
The cost of repair or a full replacement varies widely depending on your location, insurance, and type of windshield.If you have any insurance at all, a visit to an auto glass repair shop could surprise you. A professional repair is more expensive than a DIY kit, but the result may be significantly less visible.   In Florida, Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Massachusetts, comprehensive auto insurance will cover the entire cost of repair or replacement. If you are in another state or country, or if your auto insurance isn't comprehensive, you may need to pay some or all of it yourself.; , Cracks or chips on the edge compromise the structure of the windshield. Even after repair, this damage could be a major safety concern.Have the windshield replaced instead.  Damage directly in the driver's line of sight can interfere with driving even after repair. The most dangerous area is a 12 in (30 cm) wide stretch of glass centered in front of the steering wheel, and extending the height of the windshield wipers.Replacement is recommended if this area is damaged. You may decide to make the repair and judge the visibility afterward.   In this area, two points of damage within 4 inches (10 cm) of each other require replacement. This pattern of damage can create a blind spot for the driver, obscuring the line of sight from both eyes.  With modern techniques, most cracks shorter than 6 inches (15 cm) can be repaired at home. For a crack up to 18 in (46 cm) long, consult a professional first and repair it yourself only if he thinks it is safe. Any longer crack requires a full windshield replacement.If there are two or more cracks, take the car in to an auto glass repair shop and ask if repair is possible. Three long cracks almost always require full replacement.  Damage from impacts may or may not be repairable. This depends on their shape and size:Circular or semicircular "bullseye" cracks must be less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. A "star break," or point of impact with short cracks spreading outward, must have all cracks fit in a circle 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide. Other shapes should fit within a 2 inch (5 cm) circle, not counting short cracks running outward.  Windshields are made from two layers of glass, with a layer of plastic in between. If the crack extends past the outer layer and into the plastic or interior layer, replace the entire windshield.Windshields damaged from the inside are rare, and even a professional may be unsure how to evaluate it. For safety reasons, it's usually best to replace the windshield.  You can buy a windshield repair kit at an auto parts store, department store, or online. Ideally, choose one with a "bridge" applicator that fastens to the glass using suction cups. These are more stable than a syringe applicator.The applicator should also include a vacuum system to remove the air from the crack as you go.   Almost all repair kits have similar components and work the same way. However, it's a good idea to read the instructions that come with the kit, to check for special requirements.  You'll be filling the crack with resin that needs to be cured with ultraviolet light. If you can't wait for a sunny day, you'll need a UV lamp to finish the repair.   If you're parked in the sun, shade the windshield until you're ready to cure. This will let you proceed at a relaxed pace.  Use a thin metal object to gently tap out small glass shards from impact points. Some kits come with a bullseye tapper than can be used for this purpose.   Wear gloves while handling broken glass.  The windshield must be completely dry before you begin. If there is any dust in the cracks — and there usually is — clean it with a dust blower, or a small amount of acetone or lighter fluid.If the glass is wet, dry it with a hairdryer.  Take a few minutes to become familiar with how the applicator works. There are many different models, but most are not difficult to figure out by following the instructions. Check for the following:   Identify the syringe or barrel where you load the resin, and the cap or O-ring to close it. Find the dial or bolt used to adjust pressure, moving the applicator into or away from the windshield. Check the instructions for how to operate the applicator. A syringe applicator has a simple piston, but some bridge applicators may have a unique mechanism., This is the step with the greatest risk of causing further damage to the windshield. Fortunately, this is only necessary if repairing a long crack that does not end in a circular or semicircular hole, or if filling a small "star break" with no piece of glass missing.To tap the hole, place a bullseye tapper (or a sturdy needle) on the star crack or the end of a crack. Tap it gently with the suction cup removal tool (or any hard object) until a small hole pops out.In some cases, you'll need to drill into the hole before tapping. For home repairs, never drill more than ¼ of the way through the glass. It may be wiser to hire a professional instead if you can't tap the hole without a drill.  Most repair kits come with two types of resin. One is meant to fill cracks, and the other to fill chips. Load the applicator with the resin needed for your repairs, according to kit instructions. In most cases, you'll only need a few drops of resin.  Cover the suction cups with a thick layer of lubricant, so they can glide across the windshield. Position the suction cups so the applicator tip is over the hole at the end of the crack. Tighten until it presses gently against the glass.   If your kit didn't come with lubricant, try petroleum jelly (Vaseline). If you are using a syringe applicator with no suction cups, just hold it against the end of the crack.  Move the applicator along the first 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) of the crack. Apply resin according to your model's instructions. Typically, this involves drawing back air with a piston or other vacuum mechanism, then letting go to push the resin into the crack.Slide back and forth over the crack, making sure the resin is going in.   If the resin won't reach inside the crack, flex the glass gently with your thumb as you apply. This should only be necessary to get it started.  Move the applicator over the length of the crack. Once you are sure the resin is entering the crack, you should be able to seal the crack in one slow movement.   Note that the crack will still be visible at this point.  Load the applicator with pit fill, or whichever type of resin your kit includes for filling dents. If using a bridge applicator, lightly lubricate the suction cups so they stick firmly to the glass. Position the applicator tip over the chip, and use the vacuum/pressure system until the resin fills the dent completely.   Syringe applicator kits usually come with a separate suction cup to be placed over the dent, with a hole for the syringe to slot into.Remember, star-shaped breaks with no glass missing need to have a bullseye crack tapped out first. Clean out the applicator first if it contains a different type of resin.  This is also called curing strips or curing tabs when sold in different sizes. This holds the resin in place during curing, preventing it from oozing back out of the crack or pit.   You may need a suction cup removal tool or a razor blade to remove the applicator. Never use plastic wrap or other substances not specifically meant for this purpose. Some of these block UV light, and therefore stall the curing process indefinitely., Leave the repaired areas in full sunlight or under an ultraviolet light until cured. This can take anywhere from 30 to 120 minutes, depending on the brand and the strength of the ultraviolet lamp or sunlight conditions. Check the instructions for your product, and err on the side of a longer wait time.   Driving or opening car doors before the resin is fully cured increases the chance of lengthening cracks.  Remove the curing strips. Scrape the resin along the windshield surface using a razor blade. Remove excess resin until the windshield is smooth. If the windshield is blurry or the crack is still visible enough to interfere with driving, you may need to cure it again with a special refinishing resin. Wipe clean with a glass cleaner once you're done.Fit the razor blade in a sturdy razor blade holder to prevent injury.	Check the terms of insurance and repair contracts. Look for damage near the edge of the windshield. Consider the driver's line of sight. Measure the length of the crack. Examine chips and dents. Check the depth of all damage. Purchase a bridge-style windshield repair kit. Plan to use sunshine or a UV lamp. Tap out broken glass. Clean and dry the windshield. Set up the applicator. Tap a small hole if necessary. Load the resin into the applicator. Position the applicator to repair a crack. Apply the resin along the start of the crack. Seal the rest of the crack. Fill chips and dents with thicker resin. Cover all resin with curing tape. Let the resin cure. Scrape off excess resin.
Some credit card companies make you use the same card to prepay for the vehicle and pick it up, but all don’t. You could borrow a credit card from a family member and friend, and pay that person back with cash.Budget is one company that allows this. Some companies require that the person whose name is on the card and the person who picks up the rental car are one and the same. Clearly, you should only borrow someone's card with their permission, but perhaps you have a loved one who is willing to charge the rental car to their credit card if you agree to pay them back right away.  Not all companies allow this. You will need to find a rental car company that allows you to use one card to prepay for the vehicle and other identification to pick up the car. Family-owned or lower-end rental companies, such as those specializing in used cars that aren’t that great, might have more relaxed rules.Don’t assume that all car rental companies are the same. Call around, and check on their requirements.You might be able to find an independent car rental company that will accept cash or someone else’s card. The big name chain companies are less likely to do so., Some people qualify for a credit card, but they don’t want to accrue credit card debt. If you are planning on renting a car, it would make your life a lot easier to break down and get one.   You could always set aside the cash to immediately pay the card off. Most car rental companies are still going to make you present them with some plastic, whether a debit card or a credit car, in order to drive the car away from the lot in the first place. Look at it through their eyes. You’re asking to drive a very expensive machine that they own away from their lot, and they want to make sure you’ll bring it back (and that they know who you are if you don’t). Improve your credit score. Maybe your problem is a low credit score, or maybe you have a debit card but can’t rent a car because you have a low score. Pay off your accounts, and make sure not to run them up to the limit.	Use someone else’s credit card to rent the car. Check around. Break down and get a credit card.
Writers tend to read a lot, and people who read a lot tend to wear glasses. Round rimmed, big, black and squared, thin tortoiseshell ones, whatever you find to your liking.; , Choose older scents from the 1930s or use lotion that smells like pies. Have a very distinct scent though that makes people have no choice but to remember you.  headphones (or earbuds), a book (always), a recycled notepad, unusual pen. Always carry some sort of bag, whether your style is a huge yellow messenger bag or a vintage Chanel purse.  Try to achieve a timeless and elegant look when out and about. At home or at the retreat, you can wear yoga pants to your heart's content.	Wear glasses. Always smell of something slightly nostalgic. Have some sort of accessory, e.g. Be classy and elegant.
It does not matter what type of fabric you use, as you will be using seam tape to fuse them together. You can use the same color for both pieces, or contrasting colors. You can even choose a pattern for one piece, and a solid color for the other.  Make sure that both pieces match up perfectly. You can make the blanket as large or as small as you like, but keep in mind that most fabric rarely comes wider than 60 inches (152.4 centimeters).  Two of the pieces need to be the same width as your fabric. The other two pieces need to be the same length as your fabric. If you can't find any iron-on seam tape, you can try using fabric glue instead. Keep in mind, however, that the glue will make your fabric stiffer.  You will be using it later.  Make sure that you are folding inward, towards the wrong side. Also, make sure that you are folding one of the narrow ends, not the wide. These folded parts will make the "opening" to your blanket, so that you can later "hem" it shut.  Make sure that the folded part is facing upwards, away from you.  Do not place any iron-on seam tape on the top, folded edge. If you need to, pin the iron-on seam tape in place. Stick the pins vertically into the fabric, with the ball/head part sticking out beyond the edge of the fabric. This way, you can pull them out.  Make sure that the folded top edge is facing away from you. It should be aligned with the folded top edge of the bottom fabric. If you need to, pin the two pieces of fabric together.  Set your iron to the temperature specified by packaging from the iron-on seam tape. Run it over the bottom and side edges of your blanket. If you don't have the packaging anymore, then set your iron to the appropriate setting for the fabric you are using.  Remember the hole you left along the top edge of the fabric? Pull your blanket through that hole. The seams should now be on the inside. The folded part should also be on the inside.  If you plan on using your blanket as a duvet cover, skip this step. Consider using a quilt batting made out of polyester; it is more likely to keep its shape than a cotton or wool one.  Make sure that you place it right between the two folded edges. Align the top edge of the seam tape with the top edge of the blanket. Pin the tape in place, if necessary.   If you want to completely close your blanket, trim the tape down so it fits the length of the hole. If you'd like to use your blanket as a duvet cover, trim the tape down to two pieces about the width of your hand. Place the tape at the outer sides of the hole. You will simply be making the hole smaller.  Make sure your iron it set to the right temperature, then run it over the edges of the hole. When you are done, remove the pins.	Choose two large pieces of fabric. Cut the fabric down to the length you need. Cut four pieces of iron-on seam tape. Set aside one of the "width" pieces of iron-on seam tape. Fold down the top 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of each piece of fabric, and iron it. Place one of the fabric pieces down, right-side up. Align the three pieces of iron-on seam tape along the bottom and side edges of the fabric. Place the second piece of fabric, right-side down, on top. Iron the edges of the fabric. Remove the pins, and flip the blanket inside out. Cut down some quilt batting to fit, and slide it inside the blanket. Place the last piece of iron-on seam tape inside the top edge of your blanket and trim it down to fit. Iron the hole shut, and remove the pins.

Look for a product labeled as “orange polish” or “orange cleaner.” It may or may not have an actual orange tint or color. You can usually apply this polish directly to the cabinets without diluting it, however, be sure to check on the packaging. This can be a more expensive option as a bottle can cost around $12.You can also make your own citrus-based cleaner by mixing ¼ cup (60 mL) of white vinegar in with 10 drops of orange essential oil.Murphy’s Oil Soap is one popular citrus cleaner that many people trust. It is considered a mild cleaner with a relatively light scent.; , If you have numerous areas with difficult stains, you may want to make your own scrub. Get out a bowl and mix together 2 parts baking soda for every 1 part vegetable or olive oil. You can use a finger or a spoon to get this into a chunky, thick paste. Then, apply it directly to the cabinets.You can also follow this method with one of the lighter cleaning options. This should leave your cabinets with no extra residue., In a large bowl or bucket, add 8 cups (1.92 liters) of water and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of liquid soap. You can also put in a few drops of citrus essential oil, if you like. Mix it all together and apply it to the cabinets with a sponge. This is a gentle cleaner that will do a good job removing general dust.If you are looking for something a bit more powerful, try substituting the liquid soap with laundry detergent., In a large spray bottle, mix together 4 tablespoons of white distilled vinegar and 2 tablespoons of vegetable or olive oil. Fill the bottle to the brim with warm water and shake to mix everything together. Spray the solution lightly directly onto the cabinets.Using vinegar also has the added benefit of sanitizing your cabinets and removing germs during the cleaning process., If you notice a liquid spill that is running down from the counter and onto the cabinets, get a paper towel or washcloth and wipe it up right away. Get in the habit of doing this while you are cooking or just working in your kitchen. This will help to prevent your cabinets from getting discolored due to continued contact with food, such as spaghetti sauce., If you plan to work with many cabinets at once, it is a good idea to buy a large, plastic leaning bucket. You can stir your warm water and cleaning agent together in the bucket. Then, you can move the bucket from area to area as you work.After you finish each cleaning session, make sure to rinse your bucket out with warm tap water and set it upside down on a towel to dry.  Find a place on your cabinet that is not easily noticeable. Apply a standard amount of your cleaning solution to this area. Watch to see if any discoloration or waxing takes place. This will let you know if this particular cleaner is safe to use on the rest of your cabinets. You may need to wait up until 30 minutes to check the results., If you notice any areas of your cabinet that appear particularly dirty or discolored, you may want to place a bit of your cleaner on a toothbrush. Then, use this brush to lightly go over the surface of the problem spot. Keep applying consistent pressure until you start to see results. You may need to rinse off the area and reapply solution numerous times.Set this toothbrush aside and use it only for cabinet cleaning purposes.  For the remainder of your cabinets, you can dip a sponge into the bucket, let it soak up the solution, and then wring it out until it is just damp. Wipe the sponge over the surface of your cabinets until they are damp as well. Try to apply pressure to the crevices of the cabinets without creating dripping.You can also use a microfiber towel for both applying the liquid and for drying. After the cabinets are damp, let them sit and absorb the solution for a couple of minutes. You can also use this time to go over any problem areas once more., Whenever you wipe with a sponge or cloth, make sure to go with the grain, not against it. This will keep the wood looking smooth and not overly grainy. It is also a good idea to wipe in gentle circular motions. Trying to create some overlap at the edges of each stroke., After the solution has absorbed for a moment, refill your bucket with just warm tap water. Get a fresh cloth or sponge and wipe down the cabinets once more. This will remove any lingering cleaning agent and should leave your cabinets looking clean and fresh. Keep wiping until the cabinets feel dry to the touch., In addition to spot cleaning, designated a day each month where you do a full cleaning of your cabinets. This will help to reduce the build-up of dirt and grime. You will also get faster at this routine and should be able to complete it in minutes after a few sessions., If you have multiple layers of cabinets, or even with a single cabinet, it is a good idea to start from the top and work your way down. Apply the liquid cleaner at the top edges and make wiping circles across. This will let you wipe up any excess that accumulates that bottom of the cabinet., Traditional cabinet cleaners will often smear when placed on glass surfaces. To clean these areas, get an ammonia-free glass cleaner and apply with a fresh paper towel or another microfiber cloth. Place the cleaner on the cloth and then rub the surface. This will keep moisture from pooling behind the glass., These are the areas that are touched the most. They will likely be covered with fingerprints and smears. Use a microfiber cloth to gently polish these candles by applying a bit of cleaning solution. Keep going until they are restored to their original appearance., Don’t forget the inside of your cabinets. These spaces are likely to accumulate dust bunnies and food crumbs. Take a moment and use a paper towel or cloth moistened with warm water to wipe out the interiors. Start at the back of the cabinet drawers and shelves and move forward.Installing shelf paper to your cabinet interiors can also help to protect the wood and improve overall cleanliness.	Use a citrus-based cleaner. Make a baking soda scrub. Make a soap-based cleaner. Make a vinegar-based light solution. Clean up spills immediately. Mix the cleaning solution in a bucket. Do a test spot. Spot treat bad areas. Apply with a sponge. Wipe with the grain. Complete a final water rinse. Stick to a monthly cleaning schedule. Start at the top. Take care with glass inserts. Spend time on the handles. Wipe down cabinet drawers.
You can form a proper ball shape by placing your hands on either side of the clay, and rotating them in a circular motion.; , Place the clay on a smooth surface and press down on it until it is flat.  Take a plastic knife or scissors and trace out the shape of an eye (simply a small circle), winking eye (a thin arch), two eyebrows (also arches, but more curved than the wink), and smile (a thick curve).  It should resemble the image above (the iPhone version)., Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool. You now have made a clay winking emoji!	Roll the yellow clay into a ball, then place it aside. Flatten your black/brown clay. Carve the facial features.  Place each facial feature onto the yellow ball until it forms a wink face. Bake the clay emoji as long as the clay package instructs.
If you want to make your finished project even fancier, then try adding beads. You can thread a bead onto one or more of your knit stitches as you bind off. To do this, carefully slide the knit stitch loop off of the needle and then thread a bead over the whole loop. Then, slide the whole loop back onto the needle with the bead below the needle and bind off the stitch.Make sure the bead openings are large enough to easily thread onto the yarn loops.  You can also make your picots smaller or larger if desired. To make picots smaller, knit and bind off fewer stitches per picot. To make picots larger, knit and bind off more stitches per picot.For example, instead of binding off four stitches per picot, you could bind off two stitches per picot for smaller picots, or six stitches per picot for larger picots.  It is perfectly fine to use the same color yarn as you used for your project, but you can also use a different color or texture of yarn to provide some contrast and/or texture to the edging.For example, you could contrast a blue blanket with some white yarn for the edging, or choose a yarn that has a fluffy texture.	Add beads. Change the size of the picots. Use a different yarn color or type for the edging.
This recipe involves additional ingredients but it results in very strong clay that can be dropped from one meter high and not break., Mix 1 cup PVA glue, ½ tablespoon stearin (stearic acid), 1 ½ tablespoon glycerin, 1 ½ tablespoon Vaseline and ½ tablespoon citric acid in a non-stick pot over low heat. Mix completely.   Use the lowest heat possible to heat up the pot.  Add the ½ cup cornstarch little by little into the mixture, stirring the whole time. Adding the cornstarch little by little prevents lumps from forming. Keep mixing the clay until you can lift the clay up from the pan.   It will get stickier and stickier and then heavier and very hard to stir but you must continue until you can lift it out of the pan.  Place the clay on a table on top of non-stick paper (baking paper). It should be hot, a little sticky and a little lumpy. Knead the clay for about 20 minutes until all the lumps disappear and the clay becomes smooth and no longer sticky.   Allow the clay to cool down for a bit if it is still hot when you finish kneading.  Store the clay in sealed plastic bags to prevent it from hardening before use. Make sure you press all the air out of the bag before sealing. Use the clay to make whatever you prefer and paint using acrylic paints.	Use this recipe for very strong clay. Combine all the ingredients except the cornstarch in a non-stick pan over low heat. Add the cornstarch little by little and keep stirring. Knead the clay for about 20 minutes. Store the clay in a sealed plastic bag.
Ask your driver about what their food and drink policies are. If they have a no eating or drinking policy, adhere to their rules. Some taxi drivers prefer to have a strict policy to prevent spills. Alcohol is a big "no-no," as passengers drinking from open alcohol containers is illegal in many areas .Do not bring and pungent foods with you into the taxi, as smells tend to linger in cars. Clean up after yourself before you exit the cab, and take any wrappers or trash with you.  When traveling in a group, don't ask the cabbie to accommodate more than three people. Every passenger must have a seat belt. Cramming more people than the taxi has room for can get your driver in trouble. Split into several groups if you have four or more people., If your driver tries to make conversation, be kind and agreeable. Let them know if you're tired or don't feel like talking. In most cases, your driver will accommodate and give you space. Do not insult the taxi driver if traffic puts you behind schedule, and avoid disruptive behavior like yelling, insensitive comments, or vulgar jokes.  Never ask your taxi driver to speed or break the law in any way. Driving safely is an important component of their job, and driving recklessly puts their employment status at-risk., Beyond the overall fare, tipping a cabbie is polite. 20 percent is standard in most areas, but feel free to give more if your driver was especially helpful. Late at night is a common time for passengers to forget, so pay extra attention to tipping if you hailed a taxi at night.	Keep food and drinks to a minimum. Don't ask drivers to take on more passengers than they have room for. Be polite when talking to your driver. Leave a tip.
Cantaloupes, also known as muskmelons, are available in dozens of cultivated and heirloom varieties, and grow best in hot weather, at least 2-3 months of consistent warmth. Cantaloupes love very sandy and loamy soil with good drainage, and a pH of around 6.   Varieties good for cooler climates include Hale's Best, Sarah's Choice, and Eden's Gem. Varieties noted for their flavor include Hearts of Gold, Ambrosia, Athena, and Honey Bun. Pay particular attention to the time to maturity listed on the seed package. Most of the time, you won't buy cantaloupe starts, you'll purchase seeds and start them yourself. On the seed package, pay particular attention to planting advice and information about keeping them safe, and pay particularly close attention to the length of time to maturation. If you want to save cantaloupe seeds from a particularly-delicious melon for planting, scoop them from the flesh and soak them for two days in cool water, then dry them thoroughly on a paper towel. Store them in a clean, dry jar in a cool, dark environment until you're ready to start your melons. While viable for around two years, it's usually best to plant seeds within the year.; , The most important part of planting and growing cantaloupe is warm soil and enough space. The vines need some room to spread out, regardless of whether you plan on trellising or letting the melons mature on the ground, so you'll need a fairly wide bed, depending on how large a crop you're going to plant.   It's a common misconception and fear that cantaloupes will cross with other members of the same family, including cucumbers, other melons, squash, and pumpkins. They won't. Don't worry about planting your vining fruits in the same area of your garden plot. Most strange or bland-flavored cantaloupe is not the result of accidental cross-breeding, but the result of environmental factors or other problems., Lay compost or well-rotted manure evenly on your planting bed to create a rich feeding area for the cantaloupe. 6-8 inches of well-tilled soil is appropriate, plus your fertilization matter.   Start cultivating soil by tilling the ground at least a foot deep, aerating and thoroughly mixing the rough soil, removing any rocks, twigs, or other hard bits. Mix in a thick layer of manure and a smaller layer of compost on top, replacing the earth you excavated. Cantaloupes grow best on mounds, slightly raised above the surrounding ground, so don't worry if you've created a big bulge in the ground. If you want, it's common to cover the ground of your plot with plastic film or weed matting prior to planting, to speed the warming process of the soil. It's important to plant cantaloupe starts in warm soil to promote healthy growth., If you knew the exact date of the last frost of the season, planting cantaloupe would be a snap. Ideally, cantaloupes will be direct-sowed approximately 10 days before the last frost, earlier in warmer climates. Because that date is ever more difficult to determine, it makes starting your cantaloupe indoors a somewhat more grower-friendly method.If you live in a cooler climate, start seeds indoors by sowing them in biodegradable seedling pots filled with rich planting soil. Moisten the soil generously, but without standing water. After a month or so, once the plants have a few mature leaves, you can transplant the entire biodegradable pot into your garden without disturbing the fragile root system.If you live in warmer climates, you can direct sow seeds when the soil temperature warms to at least 65 degrees to avoid poor germination.  Cantaloupe should be planted in rows of raised mounts, with each row at least 4 feet (1.2 m) apart. The spacing within a row depends on how you plan to grow your melons:   If you want to grow cantaloupe on trellis poles or wires, space hills in the same row about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. Trellising typically only works for smaller melon varieties. If you plan to grow the cantaloupe on the ground, space the hills 36 to 42 inches (91 to 107 cm) apart.  Wait for the ground to warm to at least 70 °F (21 °C), sometime after the final frost of the season. Depending on where you live, this may be earlier or later in the planting season.   If you started your cantaloupe indoors, plant your biodegradable pot in the middle of each mound, as close to the center as possible. Wet the soil generously during planting. If you're direct-sowing seeds, drop 5 cantaloupe seeds about one inch deep, 18 inches apart, in hills about 3 feet (0.9 m) apart.  Keep the soil around the young cantaloupe plants moist, but not standing in water. They should get around 1 or 2 inches a week. Cantaloupe will be very sensitive during periods of drought and may need additional watering, so use your judgment and keep a close eye on the plants to make sure they're growing and looking healthy.   Melons will take a while to set on the vine, but most of the sugary flavor in a melon can be determined from the leaves. Just because you don't see melons yet doesn't mean that you don't know anything about how they will taste. Pay attention to the quality and vigor of the leaves: they should be dark green, with stiff structure and and healthy color. Yellowish or spotted leaves may be a sign of dryness or disease. It's typical for melon leaves to wilt significantly in the midday and stay wilted looking until the evening in extremely hot weather. This isn't necessarily a sign that you need to water the cantaloupe more, however, so look at the quality of the leaves, not the limpness.Drip-tape can be quite effective in watering your melons, but you can also hand-water or do whatever is appropriate for the size of your plot and other planting projects. Water around the base of the vines and try not to get the fruit wet, when it sets.  Whether you're growing new plants or have transplanted your starts, it's a good idea to cover your rows with floating row cover in order to keep them warm and protect them from insects. You can use small loops of chicken wire to create a tunnel, then drape your netting over the row.   It's important to remove the matting after the threat of frost has dissipated and blooms have started to form, so that pollinating insects can reach the blossoms. You can cover the plants again once the fruits have set. Use weed killers and chemical pest controls only as a last resort. Read all label instructions to make sure the treatment is safe for use on edible harvests and will not kill pollinating insects.  It's challenging to walk around the thick network of vines, much less to weed it. To give your vines the best chance at growth, try to weed aggressively in the first couple of weeks of growth, and let them grow big enough to get a head start and beat out the weeds as the plant matures.   One of the difficult things about growing cantaloupe directly from seed is that the budding cantaloupe plant looks an awful lot like clover, a weed that you'll want to pick. Because it would be a tragedy to pull your budding plant, try to mark your start with a plant card, or wait until it distinguishes itself from the clover to start pulling weeds. After removing weeds, add a thick layer of mulch around vines to suppress weed growth and help the soil retain moisture.  Depending on how you've set up your growing patch, it may be appropriate to trellis your melons so they can grow off the ground. A fence-style trellis set low to the ground is the most effective for growing cantaloupe.    To train the vines, start by planting poles at least 6 feet (1.8 m) tall at each mound in your melon row, or up to 8 feet (2.4 m) tall for large varieties in warm climates.You can use metal wire, planks of wood, thick twine, or any other available supplies to connect the poles and provide something for the vines to cling to. Train the vines up along the poles to get them started.  To support the fruit, give them something to rest on or in to lessen the load on the vines. Place the fruit on raised mulch beds or pedestals like upside down cans or pots. You can cover the fruits with milk crates or similar protection if they are under attack by ground hogs or other animals.  When your vines start fruiting, melons seated directly on the ground are more prone to rot and being picked off by critters. If you expect damp weather near the end of the growing season, trellising is a good way to protect your melons. If the melons started on the ground, however, don't try to trellis them mid-growth.  During the growth process, it is somewhat common to use a nitrogen fertilizer on plants that have not bloomed, or seem to be moving slower than other plants. Lining some coffee grounds around the root system can be an effective way of waking up the plant.   It's also common to fertilize cantaloupe with a higher potassium and phosphorus fertilizer after the blossoms have opened, though long time deposits of phosphorus fertilization can be environmentally hazardous. Line organic matter like compost or manure around the root system if they're lagging.  Too much watering can dilute the sugar content in the melon as it ripens and affect the flavor of the fruit. It's common to hold back on your watering in the last week before you harvest the melons.   When a cantaloupe is ready to pick, the stem will start cracking slightly where it meets the stem. It's overripe when it falls off completely.It's also common that you'll start smelling the distinctive musky smell of a ripe melon when you're near the patch. If you can smell cantaloupe, they're ready to pick. Most varieties of cantaloupe will ripen within 4 weeks of appearing on the vine, though pay attention to the guidelines of the particular variety you're cultivating for more specific instructions.  Because they lay around the ground, melon vines are particularly susceptible to pests like insects, mites, and leaf miners. To keep from worrying, you can learn to recognize common problems and figure out whether or not you've got a serious problem.    Root knots and swelling mean nematodes, a significant problem that you won't be able to take care of this season. Pull up your plants and sew some cereal rye into the soil to cleanse it.  Stickiness and wilting mean aphids, which can be treated with Theodan or other organic insecticides such as diatomaceous earth or essential oil & olive oil mixtures.  Leaf tunnels and trails mean leaf miners, which isn't something to worry about. They shouldn't affect the fruit significantly.  Yellow webbed leaves mean spider mites, meaning that plants will need to be removed, if the small red mites are significant enough., Grown and watered properly, your cantaloupe should be fine most of the time. Occasionally, though, ground-vining fruit are susceptible to blights and diseases that can ruin crops if not treated immediately. You can learn to recognize the most-common varieties of blight, so you can pull up the plants and save your other crops, or start a fungicidal regimen, depending on the severity.    Yellow spots with downy undergrowth signify downy mildew. This is sometimes treated with chlorothalonil, or other organic-based wide-spectrum fungicide, though it shouldn't be necessary for most gardens. Proper trellising of vines should help circulate air and eliminate the possibility of mildew.Broken stems emitting amber-colored liquid means gummy sap blight. This is a soil-based blight, which means the crop will likely die this season, but you can treat sap blight by rotating varietals around your plot, and possibly using a selective fungicide.  Fruit rot after rain means southern blight. In regions with heavier soil, this is a common problem. Avoid over-watering and mulch between the plant and the soil to prevent rot.  After going to all the trouble to prep your ground and start your cantaloupe, there's nothing more frustrating than a mess of vines that never sets any melons. Learning from this experience, though, can help ensure that you'll have fruiting vines in the future. Most fruiting problems are the result of one of three things:   A lack of pollinating insects can result in healthy-looking vines that never set. Cantaloupe vines produce male and female flowers, and pollination between them is necessary for fruiting. If you're growing cantaloupe in a greenhouse, or live somewhere that bees are scarce, you might need to pollenate by hand. Improper ground temperature will force the plant to only produce male flowers, which makes it difficult to fruit, even if pollinating insects are very present. Make sure you wait to put your plants in when the soil is around 65 °F (18 °C). If your melon plants struggle to produce, but you're doing everything by the book, try tilling some cereal rye in plots you plan on growing in for next season about a month before putting your plants in the ground.	Select a hardy variety appropriate for your climate. Select an appropriate location for cantaloupe. Prepare the soil. Consider starting cantaloupe indoors. In your plot, create mounds for planting. Plant your cantaloupe. Water the cantaloupe deeply and sparingly. Protect the fruits as they begin to grow. Weed the area thoroughly before the vines start running. Consider trellising cantaloupe. Fertilize plants periodically. Withhold some water just before the cantaloupe reaches full ripeness. Learn to recognize common pest infestations. Recognize the symptoms of common blights. Learn why vines sometimes won't set fruit.
Replacing a damaged headlight with a new one is becoming less of an option these days. With the escalating cost of these new headlights, price conscious consumers are in need of a cost effective alternative. With an average replacement cost of $1000 per set of lights, headlight restoration offers a cost-effective solution to replacement. External headlight issues that require replacement or restoration include: oxidation, tarnishing, cracks, sand-pitting, rock-chips, and scratching due to collision. In addition, internal issues such as fixing damaged headlight seals, leaking cracks, headlight condensation, and HID hazed lenses can generate huge profits as current kits and conventional methods cannot address these issues. An internally damaged headlight can generally be repaired for $50 - $200. An externally damaged headlight can be reconditioned for $50 – 100 with the work being performed in 30-60 minutes. The replacement cost of OEM Headlights ranges from $400 to $6400 per light. The numbers clearly favor repair over replacement. It is mutually beneficial to all parties involved.; , The headlight reconditioning industry is fragmented into small, sporadically located mobile services, and a few headlight kit manufacturing companies. This is precisely what makes the industry ripe for the emergence of a high-quality specialty franchise. The small mobile services suffer from a lack of name recognition and legitimacy, network support/pricing and skilled headlight repair technicians. The kit manufacturers offer poor quality kits that have a reputation for peeling, yellowing, and oxidizing within a few months. New car dealerships, repair shops, car washes, and detail shops are all in need of a service which provides quick, efficient and accurate repair and reconditioning.  As an entrepreneur, starting your own business is filled with obstacles from building credibility to establishing customer base and ensuring customer retention. A franchise has already spent time and money establishing its brand as a nationally recognized industry leader. This allows its franchisees to take advantage of immediate credibility with consumers. Selling Power: Ask anyone you know who has ever tried selling their service to a new car dealership and they will tell you it is close to impossible. Large nationwide accounts prefer to negotiate with national companies. Franchise sales staff will do just that… Sales associates will negotiate with new car dealerships, national auto service centers, insurance companies and others to help ensure your success over your local competitors. Proven Success Record: To make a new business as successful as an existing franchise you would first have to develop a comparable headlight restoration process and be proficient in all areas of the business: Legal, Sales, Marketing, Accounting, Computer Science, Promotions, Telemarketing Sales, Tax Law, & Back Office Services. Buying a franchise eliminates the learning curve and allows you to concentrate completely on achieving your goals. Buying Power: When a local business buys a roll of tape, the business often purchases for a single location only; therefore, it is buying a lower quantity at a premium price. When a franchisee buys the same product – even the same volume of product – it can take advantage of national accounts that significantly reduce costs for the individual dealer. Taking advantage of substantial buying power will help reduce your franchise´s expenses over your local competitors. Networking Opportunities: Unlike individual businesses that can´t share best practices with one another owing to competitive pressures, our franchise system is designed to allow for networking and knowledge share in a non-competitive environment. That way, you´ll be in a better position to learn from not only the franchises corporate staff, but also from other more experienced franchisees.  Franchisees command more money for three reasons: brand recognition, consistency of finish and warranties. Customers like the peace-of-mind that comes with the knowledge that an individual’s work and warranty is backed by a national company. Depending on the particular franchise, you may have free access to personal website development, search engine optimization, on-line ad creation and more… Some franchises even offer their franchises complete turn-key build-out including on-site training and commercial account acquisition, allowing the new franchisee to begin generating substantial revenue immediately. ,,,,,	Understand the demand. Study the industry (the supply). Consider the benefits of a franchise:   Brand recognition. Brand, Support, Margins: On average, franchisees command between two and three times the price point over competitors per restoration. Choose a process; headlight cleaning kits, buffing or polishing.  , Create warranty terms; None, 1-Year, 5-Year, Lifetime.  , Decide who your market will be; wholesale, retail or sublets.  , Develop your sales approach.  , Register your business with the Secretary of State.  , File with the IRS for a TIN or EIN.
Look for hand carders that have fine needles and carding cloth.; , Don't take too much; judge how much is good to handle by the size of your carders and your own ability.  Start on the bottom of one carder brush. Gradually add the angora fiber to the base of one carder brush and build up the amount.  Fill in the rest of the hand carder brush.  Start at the bottom and begin passing across the carded fiber from the first carder to the second carder. You will be transferring the angora fiber completely onto the other carder.  As you are transferring the fiber from one carder to the other, the goal is to really line up the fibers together, in straight rows. Make sure that they are all parallel to each other.  You should pass the angora fiber between the carders at least three times. When you have a good quality fiber to start with, three times should be sufficient; lesser quality fiber may require more passing.  Once you start getting close to finishing the carding, check the length of the small fibers. They should be at least 3" / 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) in length. That makes the yarn easier to spin, more uniform and better overall.  Once the fiber is the right length, and very smooth, it is ready to remove from the carder brush for use.  Lay down the carder brush.       Have the fiber facing up.       Take the bottom fiber (opposite to handle side of the carder brush) and roll the fiber off in the direction of the handle.  Repeat as many times with new clumps of fiber as needed to complete your project.  When you've made enough to fill your bobbins, commence spinning your yarn.	Obtain some hand carder brushes. Take a clump of angora fiber. Commence with the first pass. Continue moving it across. Take the other carder. Line up the fibers. Continue with the second pass. Check the length of the fibers. Prepare for removal from the carder brush. Put the carded fiber to one side. Start spinning.
Clasped bracelets are more advanced than stretchy bracelets. You will need additional tools and supplies in order to finish one. Here is a list of what you will need:   Beading wire Clasp and hook 2 crimp beads 2 seed beads Beads Wire cutters Needle nose pliers Tape or binder clip  , You are making the bracelet longer so that you can finish it. You also want the bracelet to be somewhat loose, or it won't be very comfortable. Lastly, you are adding extra length because some beads add more bulk than others., You want to use a soft, flexible wire. Do not the stiff kind meant for wire wrapping. You can find beading wire in a bead shop or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. It usually comes on a flat, disk-shaped spool.  You are doing this so that you can string the beads on without losing any. If you don't have any tape, you can use a binder clip instead.  If you do not have a beading tray, lay your pattern down on a table, right next to the measuring tape. This will allow you to determine how many beads you will need for your design. If you are doing a simple design (such as two altering colors) or a random design, you do not need to do this.  Once you have decided on your pattern, start putting the beads onto the wire. You do not need a needle for this. Simply hold the wire close to the end, and start popping the beads on. Be sure to measure against your wrist from time to time; large beads will add bulk, so you may need to make the bracelet longer to make it fit.  Once you have all of the beads on the wire, put on a crimp bead, then a seed bead, and finally a clasp. It does not matter which part of the clasp you put on first.   You can use any type of clasp. A spring or lobster-claw clasp is the most traditional, but a magnetic one may make the bracelet easier to take on and off.  The clasp should be hanging off of the top of the loop.  You want them to be snug, but still loose enough so that the clasp can still wiggle. Leave about an inch (2.54 centimeters) long tail on the wire.  Be sure to pinch the bead tightly. The crimp is your "knot," so it needs to be secure. Gently tug on the wire. If it moves, pinch the crimp bead tighter. Do not trim the tail off.  The beads will slide down towards the crimp and clasp. Tuck the tail into those first few beads, hiding it. Take off the tape or binder clip from before.  Put on a crimp bead, a seed bead, and the other part of the clasp. Thread the wire back through the seed bead and crimp. Gently tug on the tail until the beads are flush with the clasp.  If the bracelet is too big, you will need to take off a few beads. If the bracelet is too small, you will need to add some more beads. To do this, simply pull the clasp, seed bead, and crimp off, and then make the adjustments. Be sure to replace the crimp, seed bead, and clasp once everything fits.  If you see things shifting a little, simply pinch the crimp harder.  Press the flat side of the wire cutters against the bead and carefully snip off the read of the tail.	Gather your supplies. Measure your wrist with a measuring tape and add 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters). Use wire cutters and cut some beading wire according to that length. Wrap some tape around one of the ends of the wire. Consider laying out your design on a beading tray. Put the beads onto the wire. Finish off by putting on a crimp bead, a lard seed bead, and one part of the clasp. Thread wire back through seed bead and crimp, making a loop. Gently slide the crimp and seed bead towards the clasp. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pinch the crimp bead. Turn the bracelet upside down and tuck the tail into the beads. Repeat the process for the other end of the wire, but don't pinch the crimp yet. Try the bracelet on and make any adjustments, if necessary. Pinch the crimp bead with a pair of needle nose pliers and tug gently to test the tension. Thread the tail through two to three beads and snip off any excess wire.
Stopping and starting puts stress on the engine that can cause it to overheat, especially in older cars. Ease off the break and let your car roll forward slowly, knowing that you will likely have to stop again when you reach the next car's bumper anyway.Making checking your temperature gauge a regular habit at red lights and stop signs.  The AC uses engine power to cool the air in the car, putting extra strain on the engine. The first thing you should do when overheating is to turn off the AC, but you should avoid using it at all if you fear your car might overheat for any reason.   If you are very late for an inspection, find a leak in your radiator, have unresolved AC issues, or are low on coolant, try not to use the AC at all., Old oil can lead to overheating, especially when coupled with low coolant or other issues. Whenever you get your car's oil changed, ask the mechanics to look at your fan as well -- spotting an issue now can save you a costly fix later on.   You should hear your fan whirring after you've turned you car off, as it is still working to cool your car off., Check your coolant reservoir and make sure that the levels are still where they need to be as indicated on the sides. If they are a little low, mix equal parts coolant and water and add it to the recommended level. This is especially important if you live in hot areas.When checking the coolant, take 2-3 minutes to search for any leaks as well. Coolant is usually green and smells sweet. Check under the car, around the engine, and on any hoses or radiator parts that you can see.  You don't want to be stranded in the middle of nowhere with an engine you can't use. A simple preparedness kit will help keep you and your car safe, especially if you need to keep driving to get to a mechanic. You should pack:Extra coolant. A gallon of water. A tool-kit. A flashlight. Non-perishable food. A blanket. A straight razor blade. Duct tape. Philips and flat head screwdrivers.	Drive at a slow and steady pace instead of stopping and starting in traffic. Use the windows, instead of the AC, when to cool the car. Change your oil regularly and have your fan checked simultaneously. Top off your coolant at the beginning of summer. Keep an emergency kit in your car for overheating issues.
You will need a trainer or mentor to help you learn the correct habits to take care of your vocal chords so that you don't accidentally damage them. They can help you decide what songs to sing, teach you scales and the basics of music, and give you private lessons to identify your areas of weakness and strength.To find a teacher, you can look online to websites like ClassicalSinger.com or NATS.org which host searchable directories as well as magazines, online communities, your music teacher at school, or the parents of any friends who are also taking voice lessons. Your teacher does not have to be accredited, a professional singer, or cool. Instead, look at a teacher's history and see how their students have fared. Even if you believe that you have not and will never injure your voice, there may be tiny things you do that you are unaware of that could have serious consequences later. A teacher can identify and stop you from doing those things so that you can have a long and successful career., While there are some people who brag about teaching themselves and not knowing about the mechanics, if you want a career in music, then you will need to understand notes, melody, harmony, keys, scales, measures, beats, majors, and minors as well as many, many other things.While this may feel daunting at first, it is necessary so that you can both improve yourself to stand out from the competition as well as to show other people that you are serious.   Consider songs as mini plays where you, the singer, are playing a part. Ask yourself who you're supposed to be, why you're singing, how you're supposed to feel, and who you're singing to.You will need to spend many hours practicing the basics likes scales both at home and in your lessons.  You should try to make yourself known locally. School plays with singing parts and solos in your school or church choir are a great, free way to try to seek the spotlight that contribute to your community. Have someone record your performance to distribute it online to family, friends, and social media followers later.  If you feel ready for bigger audiences, auditioning for a broadcasted TV show like America's Got Talent is one way of getting your name and face out there. There are also national and local casting calls going on all the time. Try 2016auditions.com, kidscasting.com, and castingcallhub.com for roles involving singing and dancing. There are also prestigious regional competitions for singers that you can find more information about at NATS.org.When you show up to audition, be sure to be dressed nicely, have your song materials preselected, be aware of what you're auditioning for (especially if it is a musical play with a story and specific songs), and be sure to have a good attitude. Auditioning is a skill itself: you will probably need to audition many times to learn what kinds of questions and suggestions you will receive, as well as how to handle yourself. Don't be discouraged if you don't get the role the first, second, or even tenth time., Especially if you're looking for work as a singer-songwriter or singing as a pop star, try looking for local places like coffee houses and restaurants that hire singers for live entertainment.This will help get your name and face out there to get more and bigger jobs. It will also help you all to recover costs for training and advertising.   Use websites like Craigslist, Gigsalad, Backstage.com, YapTracker, and ReverbNation to find singing jobs that you can take.Some, but not all, of these are free to use. Some jobs, often called "gigs," will help you to build a fanbase but don't pay well, like playing at a friend's house for a birthday party, and others will pay well but not build you much of a fanbase, like singing for a wedding. Many gigs call in between as well. Try to consider what your goals are with taking a job: is it most important to make more fans, or to be paid well, or have you reached the point that you should aim for both?Be prepared to be persistent. Some places will not agree to book you the first, second, or even ninth time you call!Be careful when accepting jobs: have your parents or a legal guardian look at the job posting with you and contact the individual hosting it for you. These are people that you do not know, and it is important that even if you are eager to start making a name for yourself that you be safe.	Find a teacher. Learn and practice. Participate in school plays and church choirs. Audition for singing opportunities. Take singing jobs.
Line the edges of a sheet of printer paper with glue, then press a sheet of tissue paper directly on top. Let dry.Use a glue stick or a very light, thin line of glue. Tape could also work. The tissue paper needs to stick firmly to the printer paper, but if the glue is too thick, your printer may not be able to feed it through properly.; , Place the tissue paper structure in your printer, then print out the picture you want to use. Make sure that the picture prints onto the tissue paper, not the regular paper.   You also need to make sure that the picture is sized accordingly before you print it. Resize the picture using a photo editing or word processing program so that it will fit onto the candle without difficulty. Set the printer paper properties to a "transparency film" setting for best results.  Use scissors to cut away as much excess paper from around the border of the picture as possible.   During this step, the tissue paper should also be freed from the computer paper. Dispose of or recycle the printer paper. Keep only the inked tissue paper for this project. Some border can be helpful since it makes the picture easier to hold and maneuver, but this border should still be as thin as possible.  Press the picture against the side of the candle at the position you want it.   Usually, there will be enough static to help hold the tissue paper in place. If the picture does not stay still on its own, however, you can apply a very small dab of glue to the corners before pressing it onto the candle. The picture should be ink-side out when you place it on the candle.  Wrap a sheet of wax paper around the candle. Keep it flush against the sides of the candle, and hold it in place from the back (the side opposite the picture).The wax paper makes it easier to maintain the shape of the candle. It also protects your hands from high, direct heat. Make sure that the waxed side of the wax paper faces toward the candle.  Use a handheld embossing tool or heat gun to blow hot air onto the picture for several minutes. When the ink starts to show through the wax paper more clearly, turn off the heat.Keep the heat gun moving so that the entire image transfers onto the candle evenly. The wax on the wax paper should melt, sandwiching the image in between the wax of the candle and the melted wax of the wax paper. If you do not have a heat gun or embossing tool, use a strong hair dryer or carefully hold the picture-side of the candle over the hot eye of a stove.  Carefully peel away the wax paper from the candle. If done right, the image should remain on the candle.   If there are any pieces of wax sticking up afterward, wait until they cool and lightly pat them down or wipe them away. This completes the project.	Attach tissue paper to printer paper. Print the picture out. Trim the picture to size. Place the picture on the candle. Wrap wax paper around the candle. Heat the entire structure. Peel away the wax paper.
Singing uses more breath than speaking, so you might be tempted to gulp your lungs full of air. This is not as helpful as taking steady quick breaths while you sing. Practice drawing in ordinary amounts of air at the beginning of each phrase you sing.If you catch yourself gulping or gasping, pause and begin again. Trust your lungs to do their job. You will need more air to sing long notes, but you'll get more duration of a slow exhalation than you will out of a deep inhalation.; , Your breath carries your voice. If you force out air, or try to choke it back, you will not be able to hold long notes. As you sing, notice yourself pushing or halting your exhalation. If you are pushing, you may sound shouty or breathy. Relax your abdominal muscles and try again.If you are choking your exhalation, try this exercise: sing a vowel at a pitch in the middle of your range, then gradually shift the note to being a stream of air with no vocalization. Once you have mastered moving gradually from a clean tone to a breathy tone to no tone while maintaining pitch, you can try the technique on higher notes. Notes that are held are often high, so this is an exceptionally useful exercise.  You need breath to sustain a note. Practice singing without releasing air by listening to your voice. Do you sound breathy? Try to sing the same note again, clearly. Hold a mirror in front of your mouth while you sing the note. The mirror will fog up if you are releasing breath.   Generally, trying to actively control the flow of your breath will cause you to inadvertently choke or force the air, leading to uneven tone and loss of breath.  Breathe in, and exhale while saying "SSSS." Release your breath evenly and entirely. Do it again, trying (without pressing or forcing) to say "SSSS" for slightly longer. Don't press or force your "S," but try to release your air evenly and slowly. Incorporate this exercise into your regular warm-up routine., Lie on the floor with your knees up, and inhale and exhale slowly. Feel your back press into the floor. Balance a book on your stomach and exhale. The book should rise: you want to be breathing into your belly, not your chest.This exercise helps you regulate your breathing and can train you to trust your lower back to support your voice.  In this technique, you will breathe in for three seconds, hold your breath for three seconds, and release your breathe for three seconds. Your inhalation, hold, and exhalation of breath should be even and should not leave you gasping for air. Once you have completed the cycle smoothly, go immediately into the next cycle, this time breathing, holding, and exhaling for four seconds each.Do as many cycles as you comfortably can, each time adding a second per stage. Stop when you feel abdominal pressure or lightheadedness. Six cycles is probably your maximum for your first round, unless you are already a trained vocalist. Once you have reached your maximum, repeat the exercise in reverse, subtracting one second per cycle. Use a stopwatch or metronome. Do this daily, increasing your seconds per cycle, without pausing between cycles.  Raise your arms over your head as you inhale. Keeping your sternum in the same position, lower your arms as you exhale. Another technique is to layer your hands on your lower back, palms outward. Practice the posture of singing with a lifted sternum until it becomes natural.Singing with good posture will help you sustain high notes. Your sternum should be raised, and your chest should stay in the same position. Sing in front of a mirror to monitor your posture.  Before you sing, spend a moment flexing and noticing the muscles of your lower abdomen, lumbar spine, and pelvic floor. As you sing, check in again with these muscles, and engage them if they are relaxed. The air flowing through your diaphragm is controlled by these muscles, and engaging them allows you to control the flow of your breath.Use your lower abdomen, lumbar spine, and pelvic floor muscles whenever a vocal coach tells you to "use your diaphragm." Use this technique rather than that of contracting your abdominal muscles. This will cause uneven pressure and result in injury., When you sing long notes, which are often high notes, you need your tongue to be relaxed. As you sing, check if your tongue is tense. Push your thumb underneath your chin, which is where the bottom of your tongue is rooted. If you feel tension, massage under your chin while continuing to sing.   This will help you practice relaxing your tongue as you hold those long high notes.	Breathe in quickly and steadily. Breathe out slowly. Let no air escape. Hiss. Lie on your back and breathe. Use the Farinelli technique. Raise your sternum. Engage the muscles that effect your diaphragm. Check for tongue tension.
It is extremely important that you determine the correct type of differential fluid for your vehicle. Ask the clerk at your local auto parts store to help you find the correct fluid to use.Be sure to provide the year, make and model of your vehicle to get the right fluid. Your vehicle’s owner’s manual should also indicate the correct type of differential fluid to use.; , Be sure the vehicle is parked on a level surface that is strong enough to support the weight of the vehicle centralized beneath the jack. Black top or concrete are the optimal surfaces. Slide the jack beneath the vehicle at one of its designated jack points and use the handle to jack the vehicle up off the ground.If you are unsure of where the designated jack points are for the rear of your vehicle, refer to the owner’s manual for guidance. Never jack up a vehicle on grass, gravel or dirt.  Never work beneath a vehicle that is supported only by a jack. Once the vehicle is jacked up to a sufficient height, slide jack stands under the vehicle at another designated jack point.Jacks may lower the vehicle unexpectedly while you’re beneath it. Lower the vehicle onto the jack stands slowly to ensure they are positioned correctly.  The rear differential is located between the two rear wheels of the vehicle. While it is not always located directly in the center of the vehicle, it is usually close to the middle. The differential may resemble a basketball or a pumpkin, prompting some to refer to it as “the pumpkin” of the vehicle.Along the bottom of the differential there is a bolt that can be removed to drain the fluid. The drain bolt will resemble the one you might remove from an oil pan to drain the oil from the engine.  Make sure you have a sealable container to catch the old differential fluid as you drain it from the vehicle. Place the container beneath the drain bolt so the fluid will pour into the container once you remove it.Used differential fluid will need to be brought to a certified recycling location. Do not mix old differential fluid with oil or gasoline.  Use a hand or socket wrench of the appropriate size to turn the drain bolt counter-clockwise to loosen it. Once the bolt is hand loose, use your hand to unscrew it while applying pressure inward to keep it from leaking as you loosen the plug. Once it is completely unthreaded, pull the plug away and let the fluid pour out.You may want to wear gloves to avoid getting old differential fluid on your hands. Make sure the vehicle is cool when doing this otherwise the fluid may burn you.  It may take a few minutes for the differential fluid to drain out completely. Make sure the container is positioned properly and does not overflow as the fluid drains out.Allow the differential to drain until there is only a slow drip of fluid remaining. Seal the container once the differential has finished draining for storage and transport to a recycling center.  Once the differential is empty, use your hand to thread the drain bolt back into place, then use the wrench to tighten it until the differential is once again sealed.Do not overtighten the drain bolt. It only needs to be tight enough to provide a seal. Be sure to use the correct size wrench to avoid stripping or damaging the head of the bolt.  With the differential drain bolt in place, locate the fill bolt near the top of the differential. In some vehicles, you will not be able to see it easily, but you should be able to feel it if it is on the top. Many vehicles now place the filler bolt on the back side of the differential for easier access.Use a hand or socket wrench to remove the filler bolt. Set the bolt aside some place safe so you don’t lose it as you fill the differential.  Use a hand pump to fill the differential with fluid. You will not be able to pour the fluid directly in because of the angle. Hand pumps come in a number of varieties and will allow you to pump the fluid out of the container from beneath the differential.Open the seal on the top of the differential fluid and insert the inlet hose or tube for the hand pump. Be careful not to tip the differential fluid over with the pump as you get situated beneath the differential.  Crank or pump the hand pump to introduce new fluid into the differential. Continue to pump until you reach the maximum capacity listed in the vehicle’s owner’s manual or until you see fluid start to seep out of the filler hole.You can purchase hand pumps at most auto parts stores. Check the automaker’s website for maximum capacities if you do not have an owner’s manual.  Once the differential is full of new fluid, replace the filler bolt with your hand, then tighten it using the wrench. Ensure the filler and drain bolts are both secure and wipe them down with a rag so you will be able to identify any leaking in the future.Take the vehicle for a short drive, then check to ensure neither bolt is leaking. If you spot a leak, tighten the bolts and wipe them down again.	Purchase the right differential fluid. Jack the car up. Support the vehicle with jack stands. Locate the differential and drain bolt. Place a container beneath the differential. Remove the drain bolt. Allow the fluid to drain completely. Replace the drain bolt and wipe down the area. Locate and remove the differential fill bolt. Insert a pump into the differential fluid. Slowly pump the fluid into the differential. Replace the fill bolt.
The warp and weft threads must be approximately the same (this means fabric with and even, symmetrical weave). Heavy linen with coarse regular weave is ideal because it ensures that you can count the threads easily., While traditional Hardanger embroidery is white worked on white, today's range of fabric colors and threads open up a wider possibility of color choices.  Hardanger is not hard but it must be accurate. Counting the threads is the most important part of Hardanger embroidery. One mistake will ruin the pattern and make it necessary to start the work all over again.  The stitches used in Hardanger are the Kloster blocks stitch (satin stitch) for solid sections of the designs and under-and-over woven bars (or wrapped bars) for the cut and drawn pieces.   The Kloster block stitches are arranged to outline the cut spaces - it is these stitches that construct the major parts of the design.Additional stitches that may be used include: eyelet, back stitch, lace stitch, and fagoting.  Prior to mounting the fabric for a Hardanger project, given that the fabric may have a tendency to fray as you stitch it, overcast it first on all of its cut edges.  Make your design on paper first. By necessity, Hardanger stitches will be geometric in shape, taking on the forms of squares, triangles, oblongs, diamonds, rectangles, etc.While the outer edges of the larger designs will appear very straightforward, it will be the smaller shapes developed around the larger ones that create the textual contrasts and provide the interest to your Hardanger piece.  That way, the Hardanger decoration will be exactly in place.  A pointed needle will split the threads and make accuracy impossible.  Start a thread by placing a few stitches into the fabric and covering these with the embroidery stitches. Fasten off threads by running back on the underside of the fabric.  Try making little Hardanger embroidery squares or diamonds on a sampler. This way, you will become familiar with the work of counting threads and mistakes will be easy to remedy.	Select fabric that has counted threads. Choose a fabric color that suits your needs. Pay careful attention to accurately counting the threads. Learn the stitches used for Hardanger. Prepare the fabric well. Plan ahead. Place a basting line on the exact spots where the Hardanger embroidery will be placed on clothing and cloth items. Use a needle without a point with a large eye. Get used to the feeling that you do not use knots in Hardanger embroidery. Practice on small pieces when beginning.
Some plants only bloom during the evening and attract nighttime pollinators, such as moths. You should include nighttime bloomers in your moonlight garden because they will add both colour and fragrance to the garden. If possible, purchase night blooming flowers in white or other cool hues. A few night bloomers to consider include:Evening Primrose Moonflower Night Phlox Evening Stock Night Blooming Cereus Four O’Clock  , Some flowers that bloom all day become more fragrant in the evening. These flowers will give your moonlight garden a beautiful fragrance and will make walking through your garden in the evening a sensory experience. Some fragrant evening flowers include:Petunias Japanese Wisteria Jasmine Lilies Honeysuckles  , There are also a variety of flowers that are fragrant throughout the day and come in light colours. These floral varieties are perfect for a moonlight garden. For example, lavender has a cool purple hue and is also extremely fragrant.	Include plants that bloom in the evening. Try plants that become more fragrant at night. Include light coloured fragrant flowers.
You can choose a new or a used amp, and sometimes it would be cheaper to by used gear, but remember that some used amps will have some kind of problem that you might find when you get it home that you will have to correct or live with.; , A watt is a watt, with tube and solid state they're all the same. Just take notice that tubes will get hotter than you can hold them and will break often when playing, but solid state are almost the exact opposite but will get warm, and sometimes used amps have a very bad smell to them when they get hot inside.  Combos have the head and speaker both in one, while it's opposite for headers and cabinets. It's easier to carry and practice with combos, and some will have every effects pedal you can imagine, but at a gig you'll have to mic it up to hear the full sound. Headers and cabinets are separate so you can switch any heads or cabinets to hear a different sound or even plug in two cabinets in one head.  For the best quality and sound, choose between 10" to 12" speakers, they sound best because they vibrate and retract respectively when playing, and horns and subwoofers add for true bass and volume, so if you do see these on amps they can mean the amp is expensive.  There really aren't any set rules to finding your perfect amp, but a few are "don'ts":   Don't play bass or bass notes on your or the store's guitar amps. Don't use instrument cables to connect a head to a cab and vice versa. Never plug in your guitar into a live amp that is on and connected to PA mixers and everything else. Don't neglect to keep spare parts and spare amplifiers just in case.	Start by picking your options. Don't worry about the myth about tube or solid state amps. Choose between combo or header and cabinet. For cabinets and heads, again choose your options. Keep in mind some "don'ts".
You need to use a chalk line and box to mark a straight line on the concrete. This is the area to be cut.; , This works particularly well when working with a sidewalk.   Set the blade depth of your circular saw at 2 inches (50.8 mm). Begin cutting at the edge of the concrete and slowly follow the line you have laid out with your chalk line. I have found keeping the blade wet by pouring water on it as you cut reduces dust and helps keep the blade cooler. This depth of cut will give you a straight edge scoring the concrete to finish breaking the remaining depth and a straight edge at the top to tie in with fresh concrete.    The cut-off saw allows you to penetrate to a depth of 6 inches (152.4 mm). Most driveways, housing slabs and basement or concrete retainer walls are in this range.    Cut concrete to the correct depth. Proceed slowly, maintaining minimum RPMs of the cut-off saw. Slow speed allows the saw to keep from overheating the blade and causing shrapnel-like pieces to be tossed into the air from a broken blade. If you have helpers, have them keep the chalk line free of concrete dust made by the saw cut.	Lay out the area of concrete to be cut. Use a 15-amp circular saw with a diamond or abrasive blade to cut a depth of 2 inches (50.8 mm). Employ a gasoline or electric powered cut-off saw to get the job done when working with concrete deeper than 4 inches (101.6 mm). Follow the same steps as you did in the use of a circular saw and identify your starting point.
Make sure to wear gloves, mask and eye protection. You should also wear an apron and rubber boots to protect yourself.   You should maximize ventilation by placing a running fan in the bathroom window to exhaust air. If you have a bathroom exhaust fan, turn that on too.  Use a sponge to remove the water left in bowl. This will ensure the acid will clean the bowl to the bottom, including the critical jet-hole. This is a smaller hole at the bottom of the toilet bowl; water is pushed out of it forcefully to help the toilet flush. You’ll see it in action at the end of a flush, and buildup here may be responsible for a slow flush.  If there is a fill tube on top of the overflow tube, carefully take that off first. The funnel’s opening should be as large as possible, to facilitate pouring, but fit snugly in the overflow tube.   Make sure not to use a metal funnel; the acid will corrode it. Rinse the funnel well after use and do not reuse it for food.  You should only pour a few ounces of acid into the tube.You should pour fast enough that it begins to flow out of the holes in the toilet bowl rim but not so fast that the funnel overflows or falls out, as this would splash acid and be extremely dangerous.   Pour the rest of the gallon into the toilet bowl; this will help clear the drain.  The tighter the seal the better. Just cover the bowl portion, do not include the seat. This will keep the acid’s fumes from filling the bathroom.Alternatively you can use a clear trash bag to cover the toilet bowl.  If there are children or pets in your home, make sure the door to the bathroom is closed and locked. The acid will dislodge mineral deposits in the toilet bowl and the drain over time., You’ll have to make sure to turn on the water first. Extra flushes are advisable in older homes with iron drain pipes, as prolonged contact with concentrated acid will damage them., You can find these holes under the toilet rim. They propel water to fill the bowl whenever you flush. Make sure that water flows freely from these holes whenever you flush. You can also use a coat hanger to check the holes for obstructions and other build ups.   Repeat the procedure if necessary.	Take the necessary safety precautions. Turn off the water to the toilet and flush. Take off the tank cover and insert a plastic funnel into the overflow tube. Carefully pour muriatic acid through the funnel. Tape a clear piece of poly-film over the toilet bowl and tank opening. Let the acid sit in the toilet for 24 hours. Remove the poly-film and flush a few times. Check the rim holes for proper flow.
For example, you might need a car loan so that you can purchase a car to remain steadily employed so that you can earn enough to apply for credit, but you need credit to be able to get the car, to get the job....! If you find yourself in this frustrating circle, you may be able to get out of it by finding a cosigner.   If you are young or have just started your work history and have never applied for a credit card or loan before, you are unlikely to be able to secure a car loan by yourself. Applying with a cosigner will make you less of a risk in your potential lender's eyes.; , Even if you have managed to establish a credit history, your score may not be strong enough for you to qualify for a loan with favorable terms. You may be denied a loan or will only be given one with a prohibitively high interest rate.   Credit scores (often referred to as FICO scores) range from 350 (which indicates that you are high risk and likely to default) to 850 (which indicates that you are a very low risk borrower).Ideally, your credit score should be above 700. The further below that your score falls, the higher your interest rate will be, assuming you will even be granted a loan.  Even if you have a credit history and a good credit score, you may be denied a car loan. There are many possible reasons for this, just a few of which are as follows:   You may not have a long enough credit history, you may have recently been late on a payment (which won't lower your credit score much, but which could make the current lender see you as a risk), or you could have recently applied for too many other lines of credit.If this is the case then getting a cosigner may be your only recourse if you really need this loan.  Again, there are various reasons why you may be offered a loan with unfavorable terms, such as a high interest rate. Your credit history may not be long enough, your score could be lower than you think it is, your income could not be high enough, etc.   Your credit risk will be lowered if you have a cosigner—the lender can be more assured that they will be paid because your cosigner is guaranteeing eventual repayment. Thus, you should be charged a lower interest rate than if you had secured the loan by yourself. , Your decision about whether to ask someone to cosign for you will be aided by knowing what your current credit score is. You should also know this before you apply and begin to negotiate the terms of your loan.   You are entitled to a free credit report once every twelve months.See our related wikiHow to learn how to get your credit report for free. Keep in mind that credit reports summarizes your credit history: what credit cars and loans you have/have had in your name, how much money you owe, and your payment history (whether you pay your bills on time or late).They do not contain your FICO score, which is based on your credit history. The only way to know your score is to pay for it (various companies provide this information for a fee), but so long as you know your history, you can have a good idea of whether or not your score is strong or weak., One of the advantages to having a cosigner is that you can give yourself a bit of breathing room to improve your credit score.Assuming you will make timely payments, you will be in a better position down the road to be able to get loans on your own at good interest rates and with favorable repayment plans. The cost of securing loans with a bad credit score is high: on a $20,000 loan, people with low credit scores pay an average of $5000 more than those with strong credit scores., Nearly three out of four cosigners end up being responsible for the principal borrower's loan.Another way of understanding this: almost 75% of people who secure cosigners default on their loans and place the burden of repayment upon their cosigners. As you might imagine, this can lead to strained relationships.  Should you default, late fees and collection costs may be passed on to the cosigner, which increases the cost of what they are now responsible for paying, often beyond the amount of the original loan (remember that interests rates also apply).In some states, lenders are allowed to seek repayment from cosigners without first making efforts to contact you (the principal borrower).Your cosigner could be sued, and/or their wages could be garnished if you fail to make repayments, even if you haven't yet received notices from your lending company or a collection agency.  Once you decide that you need (or will benefit) from having a cosigner, you'll need to identify an excellent candidate. Deciding to ask a parent or family member with whom you are on good terms could be a smart move.   If you live with your cosigner, this can also help simplify the process, as the correspondence relating to your loan will be sent to the same address.  If you are married or in a domestic partnership, a natural candidate for a cosigner would be your partner. You may think that you should (or have to) apply jointly for credit if you are married, but this is not the case.Indeed, it's important that you retain your own credit history throughout the course of your relationship. If everything is always in your spouse's name, you will be left with no credit should the relationship end. Thus, you can apply for a loan as the principal borrower, but have your spouse or partner be a cosigner. It's not necessary, though, that you have your spouse cosign.You may choose anyone you want., You needn't feel as though you must ask a relative to cosign. Indeed, you may prefer to keep your financial and family matters separate.   You want to select someone who knows you well, who trusts you, and who you will be able to contact easily and communicate with clearly. Additionally, your potential candidate must actually qualify to be a cosigner. We'll explain how you can assess this in a later step.  Asking someone to be a cosigner is a big favor, and should they agree, they are taking a substantial risk for you. You want to convince them that you are fully serious and responsible, and so you ought to treat this as a serious business matter. One way to do that is to request an appointment with them.   For example, rather than putting your mom on the spot at the dinner table, try the following: “Mom, as you know I've been researching cars and loan options. It looks like I'll be able to qualify for a much better loan with a cosigner. Could we talk sometime in the next day or two about you cosigning for me? I can show you all of the relevant paperwork then and address any of your concerns.”  , You will have better luck convincing them to cosign if you can show them evidence of why you need or would greatly benefit from having a cosigner. Be prepared to show them paperwork which explains either why you can't get credit or would get much better credit with a cosigner.  You should also be able to show your potential cosigner any information about the details of the loan you are hoping to get: what will the balance be? What will the interest rate be? What will your monthly payments be, and for how many months/years will you be making payments?  , Since how you handle your repayment can affect your cosigner’s credit history, you must do your best to submit your loan payments without delays. Your potential cosigner may be worried about your ability to do this, so you should be willing to present them with a detailed plan or schedule of how you plan to make your payments.   This means that you are going to have to be willing to share personal details about your monthly income and expenses.  If the person you are approaching doesn't understand the role of a cosigner, be sure to clearly explain that to them. You should also be sure that they understand how their credit may be affected.   Even if your cosigner is never asked to take over payments, the fact that they have signed on as a guarantor for your loan will be included in their credit report. This could bring their score down.Because your cosigner is now responsible for your loan, they may not be eligible to receive other loans for themselves., It's important that you express to your potential cosigner both your understanding of the magnitude of this favor and your appreciation, should they agree to help.   The other person may feel taken for granted if you approach them with the attitude that they have to help you because they are your relative or friend. This may make them question your commitment to repaying the loan and protecting them. Be sure to conclude your presentation and request with something like the following: “Mom, I know I'm asking you to take on a significant risk, and so I want you to know just how serious I am about handling this loan responsibly. I would be so grateful if you would be willing to help.”  , It may be hard not to take it personally if the first person you approach is not willing to cosign for you. By all means, you may politely ask them if they are willing to share their reasons with you. It's possible that you can then address their concerns and turn things around.   If they remain firm in their denial, though, you will have to accept that. A person's reasons for not taking on a financial risk can be varied, and they may not want to share them with you. It's not worth destroying what was an otherwise good or important relationship over money matters.  Your cosigner will need to have a good or excellent credit history to balance out your own bad credit. Similarly, they must be capable of shouldering the repayment obligation in case you fail to keep up with the repayment. If you default on your payments, the cosigner will be required to make the repayments, or your lending company can take legal action against both of you.   Typically, cosigners are required to have credit scores of 700 or above., Because your cosigner will be asked to provide evidence of sufficient income and/or assets to be able to guarantee your loan should you default, they may have to be prepared to show pay stubs, wage vouchers, or income tax returns.They may also be required to provide evidence of stable employment and residency., Once your cosigner has agreed to help you out, you both should be fully aware of the details of the repayment agreement.   Make sure that it's clear when and how late penalties will be assessed, how many payments can be missed before the cosigner becomes responsible, and how your cosigner will be contacted., It may be possible to obtain a contract in which your cosigner will only be responsible for repaying the principal balance of the loan, should you default.Don't assume that this will be the default arrangement; you'll most likely have to negotiate for such a clause.  It's very important that neither you nor your cosigner miss any notifications from your lender; unfortunately, it can happen that mail can be lost or sent to the wrong address, particularly if you and your cosigner don't share the same address.In the meantime, late fees and penalties could accrue, and both of you could be on the hook.  Keep copies of all of your loan documents, and also keep copies of your payment information. Avoid making late payments, and inform your cosigner if you do fall behind.   It's also a smart idea to make arrangements at the time of the original agreement to have your lender send written notifications to your cosigner when/if you fall behind payments.	Consider finding a cosigner if you have no credit. Consider finding a cosigner if you have bad credit. Consider finding a cosigner if you've been denied a loan. Consider finding a cosigner if you've been offered a loan with bad terms. Get a free credit report before applying. Buy yourself time to build (or rebuild) your credit with a cosigner. Understand that relationships may be jeopardized. Understand the full extent to which your cosigner will be on the hook. Consider asking a parent or close relative to cosign. Consider asking your spouse to cosign. Consider asking someone else close to you. Make an appointment. Clearly explain why you need a cosigner. Do your homework about the loan. Share your repayment plan with your potential cosigner. Explain how they will be affected should they cosign. Remember to express your gratitude. Shrug it off if you are denied. Be certain that this person qualifies to be a cosigner. Have your cosigner gather documentation. Read the contract carefully. Negotiate for the best possible terms for both of you. Provide your lender with complete contact information. Keep your cosigner in the loop.

To prevent puckering when you are serging an inside corner, it helps to make a small cut in the fabric starting at the corner.Cut about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch in from the corner, or the approximate width of your serged stitches., When you are ready to start serging, start at the top of the material. Then, serge straight down the edge towards the corner. As you approach the corner, slow down. You will need to straighten the fabric and serge over the corner slowly., Just before you reach the corner, pull the edges apart to straighten out the corner.Then, continue serging over the corner and turn the fabric slightly as you transition to the new edge.   Another option is to serge down to the corner, stop your machine, and then pivot to continue serging over the next edge. This may be a good option for thicker fabrics that are hard to straighten out., Serge to the bottom of the new edge and go past it by about an inch or two. This will leave a tail that you can sew back into the fabric, or sew over it as you go around an outside corner.  There may be a few wrinkles in the fabric after you serge over the corner. However, you can simply iron the fabric to get these wrinkles out.	Snip the inside corner. Serge down the first edge. Straighten the corner. Continue serging to the end. Iron out any wrinkles in the corner after you are done.
If it is still light outside, use your power outage as an excuse to go outside and get active. Your mind will focus more on moving and breathing, and less being bored. If it is dark outside, you can still do some simple exercises inside, such as stretches or yoga. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:   Bike ride Jogging Jumping jacks Stretches or yoga Walk around the block If you live in a good neighborhood and the weather is nice, send the kids outside to play., Having no power at home is a great opportunity to get out of the house and do other things. If the people you are visiting don't have power either, be sure to bring along some candles, games, and snacks. You can have a fun game night while you wait for the power to come back., Is there anything in your house that needs painting or repairs? Does your bathroom need thorough scrub? So long as there is enough daylight, there is plenty you can do in your house. By the time your power is back, you might even have a sparkling-clean bathroom and a freshly-painted bedroom.  If the weather is decent, you can always pack your car, and go on a road trip. You don't have to go far. You can even go to the park or the library. If there is a big city or national park close to you, you can drive there and spend the day exploring. By the time you come home, the power might already be back.  When all else fails, you can always take a nap. You may end up having a great, exciting dream.More importantly, you will wake up feeling refreshed and energized. You may have more motivation to do things you'd usually find boring (such as cleaning), or you may get some ideas for new projects (such repainting your cabinets or working on a painting).	Exercise. Visit your friends, family, or neighbors. Catch up on some cleaning or housework. Go on a road trip. Take a nap.
Try a mnemonic device to help you remember the names of the strings: EADGBE. Simply make up a sentence where the first letter of each word is the name of a string.If you're having a hard time coming up with your own sentence, you might want to use "Eat All Day Get Big Easy." Hold your guitar in front of you so that it's facing you and look at the strings. The thickest string on the far left is low E. The A string is next to it. The third string from the left is D, followed by the G string and the B string. Finally you have the high E string to the far right, which will be the thinnest string on your instrument. One thing to keep in mind is that as you're looking down at a guitar from a playing position, the lowest strings will be on the top of the instrument (if you're playing right-handed). However, when you're told to play the "top" strings, you're actually playing the thinner strings that correspond to higher notes. The "bottom" strings are the thicker strings that correspond to lower notes.; , The frets are the bars that span the neck of your guitar, spaced about an inch apart. You'll be placing your fingers along the neck of the guitar at a position just above the fret indicated.         The first fret will be about an inch down from the nut or top of the guitar neck. The second fret is about an inch below that, the third fret about an inch below that, and so on. Basic open chords typically only use the first three frets, so when you're just starting out that's all you need to be worried about.  Even if you know how to read music, musical notation won't tell you where to place your fingers to play chords on a guitar. Fingerboard diagrams can help you learn where to place your fingers. Find them online, or download a free mobile app.The fingerboard diagram reads from left to right. If you hold up your guitar in front of you as you did to learn the strings, the line to the far left of the diagram is low E. The vertical lines on the diagram are the strings, while the horizontal lines are the frets. There will be circles on the diagram to show where your fingers should be placed. You'll see a number in the circle that corresponds to the finger that should be placed there. Memorize the finger numbers. Your index finger is your first finger, your middle finger is your second finger, your ring finger is your third finger, and your pinky is your fourth finger. Some more complex chords also require you to use your thumb, which is represented by a "T" on most fingerboard diagrams.  The G major chord is probably one that sounds familiar, as it is the basic chord in a lot of popular songs. To finger a G major chord, put your third finger on the third fret of the low E string, your second finger on the second fret of the A string, and your fourth finger on the third fret of the high E string.         If this finger position feels uncomfortable, you can also make a G major using your first, second, and third fingers instead of your second, third, and fourth. However, keep in mind that as you progress this finger positioning may make it more difficult for you to transition quickly from G major to other chords. When you first place your fingers, strum each string individually. For G major, you're going to strum all six strings, even the unfretted ones. This is what makes it an open chord. With an open chord, each chord you strum should sound clearly. If a string sounds flat or muted, check your finger positioning. You should put the tip of your finger on the string to press it down, but your finger shouldn't touch any other strings.  To make a C major chord, put your first finger on the first fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the D string, and your third finger on the third fret of the B string.Notice that the finger numbers correspond to the fret numbers. That makes C major a pretty easy chord to remember. When you strum a C major, you want to stick to the top five strings – don't strum the low E. Since you're used to strumming all six strings with G major, this might take some practice to get right. Now that you know two chords, you might want to practice transitioning back and forth between them. This will help you memorize the chord shape and your hand positioning so that you can find the chords without needing to look at a fingerboard diagram.  To make a D major chord, you'll place your third finger on the third fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the high E string, and your first finger on the second fret of the G string.         To strum D major, you only want to strum the top four strings. In addition to the low E string that you left out when you strummed C major, you're also leaving out the A string. You might want to practice transitioning back and forth between G major and D major, so you can get a better feel of which strings should be strummed.  Once you're comfortable with G major, C major, and D major, you have all you need to learn some classic songs that can be played using only these three chords.         Some examples of popular songs that you can play once you know G, C, and D include Already Gone by the Eagles, Small Town and Jack and Diane by John Mellencamp, and Thunder on the Mountain by Bob Dylan. You can find lists of songs that use those three chords online. If you can't read music, look for tablatures (or just "tabs") that simply give you the names of the chords played. You'll want to start slow. Eventually, you can pull up the audio recording of the song and play your guitar along with the recording. If you can find a live video of the musicians performing, this can help you nail the strumming pattern. It may be tough to get the hang of at first, but this will help you get your strumming and chord transitions up to speed.  If the strings are buzzing or sounding flat, it could be because your fingers are flattening out and touching the strings beside the string you're fretting. Your two finger joints should make something of a box over the neck of the guitar.The first finger joint often has the most tendency to flatten out, and can muffle or mute the string next to the one you're fretting. To help get your fingers in the right position, think of holding an apple or a tennis ball in your hand with your fingers curled around it. This is how you want your fingers to be on the neck of the guitar – not flat. C major and G major are good chords to use to check your finger positioning. Since your fingers are further extended, it can be easier for the knuckles to flatten out.  If the chord isn't sounding right when you compare it to audio files, assuming your guitar is in tune, the problem may be that your fingers aren't close enough to the right fret.Generally, you want to try to keep your fingers as close to the fret as possible – but not on the fret. In your mind, visualize the space between the frets as divided into quarters. Your finger should be in the lower quarter of this space, and no higher. For example, if you're playing a chord that requires your third finger to the on the second fret, your finger should be about three-quarters down from the first fret, just above the second fret.  You don't have to press down too hard on the string to make the note sound. Too much pressure can cause tension and pain in your hand, not to mention injuring the skin on your fingers.         When you make a chord, you should be applying even pressure on each of the strings that you're fretting. If you're applying too much (or too little) pressure to one of the strings, it can cause the chord to sound off.  Your wrist positioning is in many ways just as important as your finger positioning, especially if you eventually want to learn more advanced guitar chords and techniques such as bar chords or power chords. Make sure your wrist is in a neutral position.         If you tend to kink your wrist forward in front of the guitar neck, you'll probably experience pain after playing for awhile, and your fingers will have less mobility. You also may have the tendency to kink your wrist behind the guitar neck. This may inhibit your ability to get a clean sound from your chords, as well as causing your fingers to flatten. Keep in mind that kinking your wrist not only affects your guitar's sound and your ability to position your fingers correctly, it also can damage your wrist and lead to more serious issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome over time. If you plan to play guitar often, find some good wrist strengthening exercises and stretches to help take care of your wrists and prevent such problems.  If you aren't sitting (or standing) with good posture, you may have problems positioning your fingers or wrist correctly. Keep your thumb on the guitar to distribute the weight, and make sure your arms and shoulders are relaxed.If you're hunched over or crunching your shoulders, you probably also have the tendency to kink your wrist. Check your elbows as well. The elbow of your fretting arm should be close to your side, not jutting out away from you. If you have the tendency to jut your elbow out, this may be causing you to hunch over or to kind your wrist. At least when you're first learning to play, it's typically a good idea to practice while sitting rather than trying to stand. That way you can balance the bulk of the guitar's weight on your lap rather than hanging from a strap, which can cause you to hunch if you're unaccustomed to the weight.  To finger E major, your second finger will be on the second fret of the A string, your third finger on the second fret of the D string, and your first finger on the first fret of the G string.         From E major, if you lift your first or index finger off the string and strum, you have an E minor chord. Practice strumming these two chords together by lifting your index finger on every other strum.  With A minor, you use exactly the same finger shape that you used to make E major, but you move your fingers over to a different set of strings. This makes A minor easy to find after you've been practicing E major.When you strum A minor, leave the low E string out and only strum the top five strings. You'll strum the same strings for A major as you do for A minor.  For A major, your first, second, and third fingers will all be lined up along the second fret of the D, G, and B strings. This finger positioning can be difficult because there isn't much room for your second finger between your first and third.         You'll find that your first and second fingers can't really be as close to the fret as would be ideal. You'll get more comfortable with practice and be able to stretch your fingers closer to the fret. Practicing switching from A major to E major is a good way to practice both chord shapes together. Remember that with E major you're strumming all six strings, while with A major you're only strumming the top five strings.  While there is a more complex version of the F major chord that is a bar chord, you can learn a three-note F major chord that is much simpler. The key difficulty for you in playing the F major chord may be strumming the right strings.         To make an F major chord, put your first finger on the first fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the G string, and your third finger on the third fret of the D string. You probably recognize this configuration as the same you used for C major, just on different strings. When you strum F major, you only want to strum the three strings that you've fretted. Don't strum the low E, A, or high E strings.  Now that you know eight chords, there are hundreds of popular and classic songs you should be able to play. Search online for tabs of songs that you enjoy. Take it slow, concentrating on one song at a time until you get to the point that you can play it without the tab.         For example, since you know G, F, and C, you can learn Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones, which uses those three chords. There also are a wealth of popular songs that use four chords. In fact, C, A minor, F, and G make up the most popular chord progression for country, rock, and popular music. Note that if you find the F major chord difficult, you can transpose the chords and play G, E minor, C, and D instead.	Memorize the names of your guitar's strings. Get familiar with your guitar's frets. Use fingerboard diagrams. Try a G major chord. Move on to C major. Find D major. Start playing some songs. Curl your fingers. Stay close to the fret.

It takes a lot of equipment to plant a garden, but once you buy most of the supplies they will last through many gardening seasons. You'll find the best selection at a home and garden store or a nursery. Gather the following supplies:   Seeds or young plants. You can choose to either start your garden from seeds or buy young sprouted plants that already have a head start. Check the list of plants you intend to grow and buy as many seeds or young plants as you need for the different components of your garden. Soil fertilizer and topsoil. Bone meal, blood meal, and other fertilizers help your plants grow healthy, and a layer of topsoil is useful to have in case you're planting something that needs extra protection. Compost. You can mix compost into the soil to improve its moisture retention, buffer pH, and provide micro nutrients. You can buy compost or make your own. Mulch. Many plants require a layer of mulch to protect them from inclement weather and extreme temperatures while they're in the early stages of growth. Mulch should be spread on top of the soil to help retain moisture and reduce weeds. Soil tilling equipment. If you're planning to create a large garden, you might want to buy or rent a soil tiller, which is wheeled over the ground to break up the soil and make it into a soft plant bed. For smaller areas, a garden rake and hoe should be sufficient. A shovel and spade. This equipment makes it much easier to dig the proper-sized holes for seeds or young sprouts. A garden hose. Get a hose with a fixture that allows you to either lightly mist or fully spray plants, depending on what each one needs. Alternatively, if you are planting a large area, a sprinkler and even an automatic timer will save you time. Fencing materials. If you're planting a vegetable garden, you may need to construct a fence around it to keep bunnies, squirrels, deer, and the neighborhood pets from taking ripe vegetables.  Use the soil tiller or garden rake to break the soil in the area you mapped out for your garden. Work the soil to a depth of about 12 inches (30.5 cm), making sure it is loose and does not have large clumps. Remove rocks, roots, and other solid objects from the garden bed, then fertilize it and work in compost to prepare it for planting.   How your plants grow depends on the quality of the dirt. You can buy a soil testing kit to find out the amount of organic matter, the amount of nutrients, and the pH level of the soil. Use the results to determine how much fertilizer and other ingredients to add. Alternatively, you can take a soil sample to your county extension office and they will test the soil for free or a small fee. Don't add more fertilizer than the directions tell you to. Extra fertilizer can be toxic to plants. Note that not all plants like very fertilized soil; some would actually benefit from poor soil, so remember to find out the soil preferences of the plants you choose. If your soil test shows a pH level that is too acidic, add limestone to raise the pH. If your soil is alkaline, you can add cottonseed meal, sulfur, pine bark, compost, or pine needles to make it more acidic.	Buy gardening supplies. Prepare the soil.
Look for a coin holder that is advertised as "dust-free". The paper dust from the cardboard can cause spotting over time.; ,,,, Be sure not to staple too close to the coin because the metal can leach chemicals into the coin, and the coin can get scratched when it's being removed. At the same time, you don't want to put the staple so close to the edge that it doesn't hold it in place strongly enough. • Even if your coin holder is self-sealing, the adhesive can wear out over time and cause the holder to pop open, exposing and possibly losing your coin. Use stapling in addition to the adhesive, or consider not using the adhesive at all if you're concerned about its potential damage to the coin. •Use a pair of pliers to gently squeeze and flatten the two prongs of the staple that get folded at the back of the coin holder. This will ease sliding the coin holders in and out of the pockets of 8.5 by 11 inch clear plastic coin holder sheets. , You're done! Happy storing!	Choose your coin and the correct sized holder. Place the coin in the holder over the plastic.  , Fold the holder at the perforation.  , Hold the top side down.  , Staple at the bottom of the holder. Repeat for all four sides.  , Write any information about the coin on the front of the holder (year, grade, grading service, mint mark, etc.).
You can train your tree to grow into a distinct shape. You can also dictate the direction of growth. Before you begin pruning your persimmon, take some time to learn about growth systems.Growth systems offer many benefits. For example, choosing a uniform system will allow more sunlight to filter through the canopy and reach the trees in your orchard. If all of your trees are growing in a uniform system, it will simplify your operations. It will be easier to prune and harvest. A central growing system can also reduce limb breakage. This will help your tree to bear more fruit.  One common training system requires the use of a trellis. You will need a frame trellis. You can either build or purchase one at a garden supply center.If you are attempting to grow espalier fruit trees, this is a good system for you. Espalier is when trees and branches are all pruned to be on one level. This is commonly done against a wall or fence. Plant your persimmon tree approximately 6-10 inches from the fence. If your tree borders a walkway, you will need the frame trellis to support and train the branches. With a young tree, you can also train by movement. This means you should bend the branches in the direction you want them to grow. You don't always have to prune each branch of a young tree.  The central leader system is one of the most common ways to train a persimmon tree. It is an inexpensive and basic system. One disadvantage is that your tree might grow taller than you wish, since it is not trellised.After planting, choose a healthy shoot near the center of your tree. This will be your central leader. During pruning, remove shoots near the central leader. You do not want other branches to compete with it. In the winter, prune your leader by 1/3. Tie down competing branches. Repeat this process for two years. This will keep any side branches from becoming strong enough to compete with the central leader.	Learn about growth systems. Use a trellis. Use a central leader.
Get out a sheet of paper and draw a simple design using a dark-colored pen. If you don't know how to draw, find a simple outline online and print it out. You can also tear a page out of a coloring book.  If you can't find one, you can use a plastic zippered sandwich baggy instead.Plastic wrap may also work; be sure to tape it to your work surface, over your design.As a last resort, you can also try wax paper.Avoid parchment paper. It will absorb the glue and make the window clings difficult to remove later., Measure out 2 tablespoons of white school glue and put it into a bowl. Add 2 drops of dish soap. Stir in some liquid or gel food coloring.How much food coloring you use is up to you. The more you use, the darker and more vibrant the color will be. You can also use liquid watercolor instead of food coloring.If you don't care about the window clings being translucent, you can add a few drops of acrylic paint instead. If you want to make more colors, repeat this step for each color. Stir in some glitter for a more sparkly effect.  You want the paint to be thick enough so that it will be sturdy.Avoid making it too thick, however, or it will run and not dry properly.Make sure that the colors touch, or your window cling will fall apart.For a neater finish, outline your design first using glitter glue or a glitter glue pen. Puff paint may also work., If they still appear milky, they may not be ready yet. Take a peak under the template to make sure.  Do it slowly and use both hands. If the window cling is very large, you may have to pull it off bit by bit. If the window cling is difficult to pull off, it may be too thin. Paint another layer of glue on top, let it dry, and try again.If your window cling is still too difficult to pull off, stick it in the freezer for a few hours.  Press the smooth side (the one that was against your template) against a clean window. For a sun catcher-like effect, place it in a bright, sunny window.	Draw your design. Slip your design into a plastic page protector. Mix the glue, dish soap, and food coloring. Apply a thick layer of paint to your design with a paintbrush. Let the window cling dry overnight.The window clings will become more translucent as they dry. Peel the window clings off. Use the window clings.
The goal is a vegetative light cycle (18 hours of light at least), with eight or more hours of direct sun or bright artificial light. If you need lots of an herb, you will need to take care of the herb's lighting needs. For example, basil and coriander (cilantro) need just a bit more light than other herbs, and really prefer 8 hours or more of direct light each day. In addition to this, if you want fresh pesto, just a pinch here and there is not going to cut it. Here's what you can do about it:   Whenever the light levels are low, give them a boost. Two or three fluorescent lights above your plants will greatly increase growth and yield. You can grow enough basil for a few servings of pesto now and then and still have enough always at your fingertips. With a small metal halide light, you would have a larger area with better lighting. You could produce an abundance of any herbs you choose for your culinary and aromatic delights. Basil would take well to the bright conditions under a metal halide, as it is a Mediterranean, sun-loving herb.; , Some herbs grow better in poor soil, as they can develop a stronger flavour. The oils in herbs make them special. Very fast growing herbs often grow plain leaves and stems more quickly than they can produce tasty essential oils. Often you will hear, "Basil grows better in poor soil," or, "Your basil will taste better if you don't fertilize". What is really meant here is, "Don't grow your basil too fast." (Basil is an example to which this applies).  When growing in a container it is a little different. The plant still needs some food to grow, and when that food runs out you will need to fertilize. However, as you will see next, this is all taken into consideration together with the growth habits of your herbs:   To keep initial growth rates in control, use a soil mix with just enough nutrients. Mix 2 parts coir (coconut fibre) compost to 1 part perlite, and then add 20 percent worm castings. Test the pH of any mix, and if it is acidic, add one gram of hydrated lime for every litre of soil mix. Or, you can substitute with vermiculite, which does not need pH adjusting. Finally, add 1 tablespoon of kelp meal for each gallon of soil to add plant hormones and to give beneficial micro-organisms something to feed on. Use this mix whenever you transplant.  If the surface of the soil feels dry, you need to water. Another way to tell is to pick up the container and check how heavy it is. Your herbs like their soil to drain fast. You need to have containers with holes in the bottoms, and you need to add a layer of broken roof tiles (slate is ideal) or other small flat stones, or a centimetre or so of perlite or gravel to the bottom of each container as you transplant. It is best to water thoroughly but less often. Water the container until some water comes out of the bottom, but don't over-water.  When the herbs have been in any container for ten days or more, you need to begin feeding them. In a container, the roots are stuck in a small space and will quickly mine it free of any nutrients, especially if you have been going easy on the nutrients to begin with. Feed with half-strength nutrient such as Maxsea 16-16-16 every two weeks.  If you really want to keep your plants healthy, it is recommended to use 10 ml/gallon B1 plant mix and liquid seaweed in every drop of water you give to your plants. The B1 consists of vitamins and root hormones, and the seaweed is trace nutrients and plant growth hormones. This will help with essential oil production. Finally, water basil from around the base; it does not like water on its leaves.  As soon as the herbs have grown enough leaves to be pinched without affecting their growth, you can begin using some of the herbs. This usually takes about 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the herbs. Herbs like basil are best when harvested before flowers open. You will get your highest essential oil levels when you harvest at the end of the dark period, assuming you do not leave the lights on 24 hours a day.	Provide adequate light. Select the proper soil. Correctly set up your containers. Know when to water. Start feeding your plants after 10 or so days. Give an additional boost to your herbs. Use your herbs when they're ready.

Before you can begin to count in music, you need to understand how long an individual note or rest lasts. Notes are the periods of sound in a song, and rests represent the lengths of the silences in a piece of music. A whole note lasts for four beats. A half note lasts for two beats. A quarter note lasts for one beat. An eighth note lasts for a half of a beat. A sixteenth note lasts for a quarter of a beat. Rests follow the patterns of the notes. For example, a half rest is a silence that lasts for two beats. A dot next to a rest or a note means that the note or rest is increased by half its value. For example, a dotted half note lasts for three beats. , Make sure you understand that every piece of music is divided into parts called measures or bars. This will help you count beats. Every measure in a piece of music has an equal number of beats.  The time signature appears at the beginning of every piece of music as a fraction. It may change throughout a song, and if it changes, the new time signature will appear at the beginning of a bar. Look to part three below for more information on understanding time signature and determining a time signature by listening to a song.  As you read sheet music, articulating the beats in a song make them easier to understand and keep track of. For eighth notes, use “and.” Say, “one-and-two-and-three-and-four.” For sixteenth notes, use “e” and “a.” Say, “one-e-and-a-two-e-and-a-three-e-and-a.”In a song, the downbeat is the first articulated beat in a bar. For example, the “one.” Make sure you find and articulate this first. The upbeat is the “and.” For example, if you are tapping your foot to a beat, the upbeat is the time when your toes are in the air.  If you know the time signature of a piece, a simple way to help keep a steady tempo while counting beats is to use a metronome. A metronome gives a regular ticking sound with a set rate of beats per minutes. Many free metronomes can be found online.	Know your notes. Measure it. Determine time signature. Use your words. Use a metronome.
Growing kiwifruits from seed is a fun project and will give you a nice ornamental plant. Kiwifruit do not always grow true to type, meaning that your plant may not produce edible fruit like the one it came from.If you want to grow a kiwi plant for its fruit, purchase a grafted plant from a nursery. Three major types of kiwifruit are:    Common kiwi – This is the type of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) typically found in grocery stores. It is a brown, fuzzy fruit with a thick skin and green pulp. For optimal growth, it requires about a month of cool weather with temperatures ranging from 30 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 to 7ºC). Common Kiwi can be grown in USDA hardiness zones 7-9.Golden kiwi – Another popular type of kiwi, the golden kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) is sweeter but more delicate compared to the common kiwi. It is closely related to common kiwifruit but is less fuzzy and more yellow. This fruit grows best in zones that experience winter lows ranging from 10 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (-12 to -1ºC).Kiwi berry – This name usually refers to two different kiwi species, the hardy kiwi (Actinidia arguta) and the super-hardy kiwi (Actinidia kolomikta). These kiwifruits are much smaller compared to common and golden kiwis and have a thinner, smooth skin. As their names suggest, this type of kiwi is the most cold-tolerant and can be grown in areas that experience harsh winters.These varieties are sometimes able to produce fruit after just one growing season, in contrast to most others that take years to mature.; , If you've decided to grow common kiwifruit, getting seeds can be as simple as going to the grocery store and buying a fruit. According to some gardeners, seeds from organic fruits are more likely to germinate and grow hardy adult plants. For more exotic types of kiwi, you can order inexpensive seeds online from a variety of vendors.   To remove seeds from a fresh kiwifruit, simply slice the fruit in half and scoop a them out with your fingers or a spoon. Place the seeds in a small bowl or cup and rinse them to remove the fruit. To rinse, swish water around in the bowl and strain it back out a few times.Keep in mind that most kiwi growers favor purchasing young plants created through propagation from nurseries rather than sprouting them from seeds. This is partly because propagated cultivars possess traits that are much more consistent over generations. Additionally, most varieties of kiwifruit are delicious, meaning that both a male and a female plant are required for fruiting to occur. Since the only way to tell the difference between the two is through their flowers and flowering usually takes three or more years to start happening, it's difficult to accurately space seedlings for optimal pollination and fruit production.  Place your seeds in a resealable plastic bag along with a damp paper towel. Zip the bag up and put it in a warm spot. Check your seeds every day until you see that they have sprouted.   If you notice the paper towel drying out before your seeds have germinated, be sure to moisten it again. The seeds need a humid environment to sprout., Prepare and moisten a few pots of seed starter potting mix, one for every three or four seeds. Tear off a section of the moistened paper towel you used to germinate the seeds that has a three to four seedlings clinging to it. Plant this, paper towel piece and all, into one of your pots. Repeat until all seedlings are planted., Windowsills are generally the best choice unless you have a basement equipped with grow lights.   Young plants are especially sensitive to winter chills, so many growers keep their kiwi plants indoors for the first two years or so.Remember to transfer your plants to new, larger pots as they begin to outgrow their smaller ones. At this stage, begin boosting their nutrition using a generic starter fertilizer., Make sure conditions there are suitable.   You will need adequate space for your kiwifruit plants to grow. Most kiwifruit plants grow best in either full sun or light shade.Kiwifruit generally need slightly acidic soil that has a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. If your soil is too alkaline, you can try to acidify it to make conditions right for growing kiwifruit.The soil must be moist but well-drained., Remember that kiwifruits are vine plants that can grow up to 30 feet long and weigh a fair amount.Like other vines, they grow best across vertical structures that provide support and greater access to light.   Kiwifruit vines can grow on most types of trellises, gazebos, and fences. Commercial kiwifruit growers use six-foot-high wire trellises with T-bars spaced 15 to 20 feet apart. , Transplanting kiwifruit plants is largely the same as other types of plants. The major difference is that you must space your plants so that each is at the base of its own support structure. Simply dig a hole for each plant that is a little bigger than their current pots. Carefully lift each plant out of its pot, including the roots and the dirt they cling to, and place the roots into the holes you just dug. Finish by filling in the edges of the hole with loose dirt.   Try to disturb the roots as little as possible to avoid shock.If you plant to grow fruit, keep as many plants as you have room for. Once they flower, which can take up to five years, you can identify the male and female plants and cull the extras.  Even if all other conditions are perfect, your plants may be destroyed by various pests. Kiwifruit plants will be especially vulnerable until they have fully matured.   The leaves of kiwifruit plants can sometimes attract deer. Keep your young plants safe by keeping deer out of your yard with either a fence around it or chicken wire surrounding your plants. Cats respond to kiwi leaves similarly to catnip. If you've ever tried to grow catnip, you probably know that neighborhood cats can easily destroy your plants. If there are outdoor cats in your area, take measures to keep them out of your garden. Example strategies include building a fence, putting chicken wire around each of your plants, and spraying with repellents. Unlike many other commercial fruit-bearing plants, kiwifruit do not have many insect enemies, so regular pesticide use is usually unnecessary., As your kiwifruit plant grows, it will begin to send out shoots. You will need to train these shoots to grow on the support by wiring the vines to the trellis. This will ensure that the plant will grow a strong "trunk" section., You should prune your kiwifruit plants once a year. Trim excess canes (vines that have grown a bark-like skin) and any lateral shoots not supportable by its trellis. Lateral shoots are branches that go off to the sides. Your kiwifruit vines will not be able to support the weight of such shoots on their own until they've reached the top of your trellis (when using the T-support system). Once the vines reach the top of the trellis, they will be able to grow more horizontally across it.   The optimal time for pruning female plants is late winter while the plant is dormant. Male plants can be pruned sooner, right after flowering., Kiwi plants will usually flower within four or five years of planting. When this happens, you can identify the male plants by the bright yellow, pollen-covered anthers in the flower's center. The female plants have sticky stalks (stigma) in the center instead, and white ovaries at the base of the flower.Since only the female kiwi vines produce fruit, you'll want one male plant to pollinate every 8 or 9 female plants, rather than an even split between the two. Remove the excess males and space the survivors an equal distance apart among the female vines., After a few years (or even that same year for hardy and super-hardy kiwi), your plants should start producing fruit. Yields may start out small but typically increase every year as the plant matures.   Kiwifruit usually ripens in September and October. If frosts typically happen by then in your area, you will need to harvest the fruit before it's ripe and let it finish ripening under refrigeration.Snap kiwifruit off at the stalk when their skin begins to change color (to brown for common kiwifruit). Another way to check for harvest-readiness is to look for black seeds in a sample fruit.	Choose a type of kiwifruit. Obtain kiwifruit seeds. Sprout your seeds. Plant your germinated seeds. Place your plants in a spot that gets plenty of light. Find a good spot in your garden for your kiwifruit. Build a sturdy trellis for your plants. Transplant the young plants. Protect your kiwifruit from animals. Tie shoots to supports. Prune your plants regularly. Cull the male plants. Harvest your fruit once it's ripe.
Poison ivy can take the form of an upright woody shrub, and trailing shrub, or a woody vine, but the leaves are always compound leaves consisting of three leaflets coming off the same stalk.Each leaflet is generally 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. The middle leaflet is usually slightly bigger than the other two.       The leaves have pointed tips and are often green and glossy, but some poison ivy plants have dull green leaves, instead.       Poison ivy plants can grow in a range of areas, but it is most commonly found along wooded trails, roadsides, and fenced rows.; , Wear gloves as you work to prevent the plant from coming into contact with your skin. Wear long pants, long sleeves, socks, and shoes. Cover as much skin as possible.   Discard or wash the gloves after the plant has been removed. Also wash the clothes you wore. Thoroughly rinse the washing machine after washing your work clothes to avoid contaminating the rest of your laundry.  New or small poison ivy shrubs can be dug up using a shovel. When removing the plant, remove all parts, including the entire root.   Note that poison ivy plants can grow from root sections, so the entire root must be removed in order to ensure that the plant will not return.       Removal is most effective when the soil is moist.  If you cannot pull or dig out the root of a long vine or mature plant, use sturdy garden shears to cut the plant off at the base.Sever the plant as close to the ground or visible base as possible. Keep up on the process. You may need to continually cut the plant down before you successfully starve it. Thoroughly clean the shears after cutting the plant to wipe away the poisonous oil. Use soap and water or bleach diluted with water.  Chemical herbicides can be applied to freshly cut poison ivy or to poison ivy plants that have not been cut.   To maximize effectiveness, apply a chemical herbicide immediately after you cut the plant down to the ground. Do not wait to do so since the plant may close the fresh "wound," thereby eliminating your ability to access the plant's roots through the exposed portion. Note that herbicides capable of killing poison ivy will also kill other plants. For this reason, it is important that you apply the chemical directly to the poison ivy plant. One of the best ways to do this is with a small foam paintbrush. When possible, look for an herbicide that is specifically labeled for use against poison ivy. Chemicals commonly used against poison ivy include glyphosate, triclopyr, and amino triazole., Any plants or plant sections that have been removed should be wrapped in a plastic bag and thrown out.   Do not burn the poison ivy. When burned, poison ivy produces a dangerous smoke that can cause damage to your eyes, skin, or respiratory tract.	Identify the poison ivy. Take protective measures. Dig up small plants. Cut down larger plants. Apply herbicide. Discard removed poison ivy plants.
All fabric has a direction, which refers to how the grain line of the fabric moves. When cutting your fabric, you want to make sure you're cutting in the direction of the grain line. If you're not, this could result in a tight, ill-fitting final product.         Stretch out either end of your fabric. One end of fabric should stretch out slightly further. The side that stretches further is your fabric's direction. You'll want to cut in the direction of the stretcher side when cutting your fabric.; , With a fly zipper, you'll need to sew it into two matching pieces of fabric. These pieces of fabric make up the front of your pants, or skirt. You should use a pattern here, especially if you're new to sewing. The precise size you'll need will depend on your measurements, or the measurements of the person who you're making the outfit for.         On a fly zipper, each pant front has an outward flap. This is a small, somewhat rectangular curved portion of fabric that sticks out from the edge of the pant fronts. You will sew the zipper into these flaps, as they will eventually form the fly of the pants. Your pants fronts will essentially be two rectangles of equal size. Each rectangle will have one outward flap. The flaps should also be of equal size. One rectangle should have an outward flap on the top right corner. The other should have an outward flap on the top left corner.  You will want to sew the two pant fronts together. You will be sewing together the sides containing the outwards flaps. Consult your pattern here. The seam line should be drawn about half an inch into the pant flap, leaving some overlap between each flap. The precise overlap depends on your pattern's requirements.         Use a pen to draw the seam line. Make sure you draw the line on the backside of the fabric. This is the side of the fabric that will face your body when you wear the outfit. It is usually a duller color than the front side of the fabric. The seam line is a straight line that runs along the long side of each pant front. Use a ruler to keep your seam line as straight as possible.  You want to baste a certain portion of the seam line. You baste this portion as basting stitches can be undone easily. The basting line will be removed once the fly zipper is installed.You will start sewing at the bottom of the pant fronts and sew upward towards the outward flaps. At a certain point, you will stop sewing and begin basting. Consult your pattern to see how many inches you sew upward before you begin basting. Find the point where you begin basting with a ruler and mark it with a pen. You can mark the beginning of the baste line with a dot, a horizontal line, or another marking of your choosing.  Take your two front pieces. Place them on top of one another, with the front sides of the fabric touching. Make sure you line up the front pieces so they're matching. If you look at your lined up front pieces from an eagle eye view, they should look like a single piece of fabric.  Start at the bottom of the seam line. Do regular sewing, preferably using a sewing machine, until you reach the marker that indicates you've reached the basting line.         Make sure to use the same color thread as the fabric you're using. If you don't have the right color handy, go one shade darker rather than one shade lighter. This will look less awkward when you complete the project.Once you reach this marker, you'll want to back stitch slightly. This means you'll sew backward for an inch or so, sewing over the stitches you've already made.  Once you've reached the baste line, switch to a basting stitch. Continue basting until you reach the top of the pant fronts. A basting stitch is a light, simple stitch that can easily be undone.         To do a basting stitch, you sew in a straight line and weave the needle in and out of the fabric. Press the needle through the underside of the fabric and pull it out onto the upper side. Then, move the needle forward about half an inch. Push the needle through the upper side of the fabric and pull it out onto the underside. Try to keep the space between stitches as even as possible as you work. Repeat this process until you've reached the top of the basting line. A basting stitch should look like a dotted line running along the fabric.  Once your pant flaps are sewn together, spread them apart. This is sort of like opening a book or newspaper. When spread apart, the pant fronts should form a rectangular shape. Place the now connected pant fronts on a flat surface, with the underside of the fabric pointed upward. You will notice the outward flaps have spread apart and form a circular shape on the top of the pant fronts. You should also notice the seam.         Remember, the seam line was drawn about half an inch into each pant front. Two strips of fabric should be pressed against each other, running down the center of the connected pant fronts to form a vertical line. You'll want to separate these strips of fabric. Like spreading the pant fronts apart, this is like opening a book or newspaper. When you've separated the strips, flatten them against the pant fronts. When you're finished, there should be two rectangular strips of fabric side-by-side that run down the center of the connected pant fronts.  Take your zipper tape and place it on the top of your pant fronts. The zipper tape should lie on the left outward flap. The right side of the zipper tape should line up with the basting line.         The actual zipper handle, found on the end of the zipper line, should not be on the edge of your pant fronts. You'll eventually add a waist line to your pants, where you'll likely add a button.There should be a few inches of loose zipper line between the end of the pant fronts and the zipper's handle.  Once your zipper is in the proper place, take some pins. Use these pins to secure the zipper in place.         It's a good idea to place the pins parallel to the seam. They will be easier to remove, and stay in place more., Grab onto the left outward flap. This is the outward flap to which the zipper line is now pinned. Pull the outward flap upward. Then, press the pant fronts together, like you did when you initially sewed them. The pant fronts should be on top of one another, with the left outward flap sticking out to the left. You want to separate this outward flap from the actual pant fronts so you can sew the zipper into this flap.  From here, you'll want to begin the process of sewing the zipper to your pants. You'll want to first sew the left side of the zipper line onto the outward flap. This should be the side of the zipper line closest to the curved outward flap. Do not sew the side of the zipper line closest to the pant fronts.         Sew the zipper onto the outward flap by sewing the length of the basting line. Start at the bottom of the zipper line and work your way up to the top.  Pull the zipper line upward. Fold the pants fronts in half, dividing them by the zipper line. The idea here is to get the bulk of the fabric out of the way so you're just targeting the zipper and a small portion of pant fabric when you sew next. You should be left with a rectangular shape of layered fabric, with the zipper line sticking out its left side.  A small amount of fabric should be folded over the right side of the zipper line. Along this fold of fabric, you will see one of the basting lines you originally drew. Sew along this fold, following the basting line. This will help secure the zipper in place further.  From here, reach underneath the folded fabric. You should feel the right outward flap. Move this flap out from under the folded portion of fabric. Lie it flat against the table.  Pin the zipper line onto the right outward flap. Then, sew the right side of the zipper line into the right outward flap. Once again, sew the zipper line on the side facing the outward flap.  Unfold the skirt. Lie it flat on the table, this time having the front side of the fabric facing upward. Use your fingers to feel where the zipper tape runs down the underside of the fabric. Pin all the layers of the skirt together in a line that runs down the zipper line.  When sewing a fly zipper, there is a line called the top stitching line. This is a line on the front side of the fabric you need to stitch. Consult your pattern to find where to draw your top stitching line.         If you're not following a pattern, the top stitching line mirrors the shape of the left outward flap. You can feel for where the flap falls with your fingers, and trace its outline using a fabric pen. Make sure to choose an erasable fabric pen to draw this line. This portion of the skirt will be visible, so you want a line you can remove later.  Take a needle and thread. Starting at the top, sew along the top stitching line. Sew until you feel the edge of the zipper line. Stop here.  You're almost done. Once you've sewn the stitching line, all you have to do is remove the basting stitches you made when first sewing the pant fronts together. You can use a tool called a seam ripper, which you can purchase at any craft store.         Gently slip the seam ripper below each stitch on the basting line. Pull the stitches until the thread breaks. Then, remove any excess bits of thread with your fingers. You may have to use a pair of scissors to trim any lingering thread still stuck to the fabric. You should now have a fly zipper securely sewed to your pant fronts. The fly on your pants will be completed.	Figure out your fabric's direction. Cut your pants fronts. Mark the seam on each pant front. Mark where the sewing line ends and the basting line begins. Line up the front pieces. Stitch down the seam until you reach the end of the basting line. Continue to the top with a basting stitch. Press the seam open. Line the zipper up with the basted seam. Pin down the zipper. Fold the pant fronts out of the way. Sew the left side of the zipper line into the left outward flap. Fold the pant fronts in half. Run some stitches down the fold near the zipper line. Move the right flap outward and lie the flaps flat on a table. Sew the right end of the zipper line to the right flap. Pin down your layers. Draw a top stitching line on the front side of your fabric. Sew along this line. Undo your basting stitches.
Swim fins are similar to diving fins but are designed to enforce and enable the dolphin-kick style of swimming. They provide greater resistance and thus a greater workout, making them an excellent exercise method. Monofins are swim fins with a single blade, which hold the feet together to encourage proper swimming form.   It will be easiest to purchase a monofin style swim fin but a monofin can also be created by duct-taping together single swim fins or making a monofin completely from scratch. The latter two methods are not recommended but are certainly possible if a monofin is not available.       Monofins and other swim fins can be purchased at swimming and sports stores, as well as online. make sure to buy from a brand that can insure that they can are good to not break when you swim in them as cheap fins can fall apart or be uncomfortable or simply not work for swimming. Try it on. The foot pockets come in two styles: one with a single pocket and built-in heel and one with no heel and a strap to secure the fin to the foot. Either style should feel secure when you kick but it should not pinch or chafe. Your feet should feel comfortable and flexible.; , With the monofin on, you can simply trace the shape of your legs and the fin onto cardstock or cardboard or you can measure yourself and create the pattern from the measurements. If tracing, get help from a friend. Making a pattern from measurements will require more math but will also be more accurate.   In order to make a pattern from measurements, measure the circumference (in other words, all the way around) your waist, hips mid-thigh, knees, upper calves, and ankles, as well as take the dimensions of the monofin. Then measure the length between each section (knee to upper calf, upper calf to ankle, etc.). Divide the circumference numbers in half and then draw your pattern, ensuring the width of each section is the same as the halved width measurements as well as ensuring that the distance between each section is the same as the length measurements you took. The monofin can probably be traced directly onto the pattern separately from your legs, once you know where the feet will be. You may wish to take measurements at more points along your body to ensure a more accurate shape, however, the swim fabric used to create the tail is usually stretchy and will generally conform to your shape so it does not need to be perfect. For the pattern, you can draw it with a seam allowance or without. If you do not draw it with the seam allowance, make sure that when you cut the fabric you do leave room for the seam. Normally, it is better to not make a pattern with the seam allowance, as you can use the lines as a guide when sewing. There are multiple ways to do the fin. The easiest method is probably to leave a few inches of fabric at the bottom, along the bottom edge of the fin, and to leave the bottom open. This will allow you to put the material on like a skirt and then the fins, stretching the fabric over the fins once they are on. The excess fabric at the bottom can be cut to look like the uneven edges of a fish fin. Another method would be to have a zipper along the bottom fin edge, and a clean line. The last method would be to have a single seam all the way around, but this will make it more difficult to get in and out of the tail, as well as creating the difficulty of getting the monofin inside the fabric. This will only work if you have a fin that is in two sections and is fairly flexible. Decide which method is best for your needs and skills and make sure your pattern accounts for the method you have chosen.  First, you must buy fabric. Try local sewing and craft stores or look online to find fabrics. Use stretchy material suitable for going in water, namely nylon spandex. Look for fabrics labeled as swimsuit material. Thicker material is better than thinner material, as it will give a more flesh-like appearance.   Fold the fabric in two, so that the sides you want visible are touching, then trace the pattern onto the fabric using sewer’s chalk. A marker or pen can also be used if you do not have chalk, but be aware that the lines may be visible once the fabric is flipped right-side-out. Pin all along the traced line using straight pins so that the two fabrics are solidly joined.       Now, cut the fabric. As stated above, make sure that there is a seam allowance when you cut the fabric. A generous 1” allowance is best with this type of fabric. Cut the fabric using very sharp scissors, preferably sewing shears, or any tool designed for cutting fabric.       Make sure to leave an extra inch or two at the top, where the waist is located, in order to make a hem for the waist. You should also be sure that you cut your fabric appropriately for the method you chose for enclosing the fin.  Leaving the fabric open at the waist, sew down one side and then the other, following the drawn line of the pattern. Be careful of the straight pins and remove them when they are no longer needed. If you are going to completely enclose the monofin, simply start at the waist and go all the way around until you reach the other side. If you are leaving it open or are using a zipper, do not sew along the bottom edge.   Since the fabric is stretchy, you will need to account for this in how you sew it. Use a ball-point needle on your machine and set the machine for a stretch stitch, if possible. If your machine does not have a stretch stitch, use a zigzag stitch. You do not want to use a straight stitch, since this stitch will break when the fabric is stretched. Make sure you also have the tension on the foot set a little bit looser than normal.When you are done with the sides, put in the zipper if you are using one. Sew the hem of the waist and the flip the fabric right-side-out. Now you are done!	Purchase or make swim fins. Make your pattern. Cut the fabric. Sew the tail.
Memorize the part so well that singing it is second nature. You should be able to sing your entire part a cappella. Refrain from extensive practice 2 or 3 days before the session.; ,   Go to sleep as early as possible and try to get a good night sleep the night before the recording session. Rest rejuvenates your system and gives you energy. Sleep in a comfortable position with your head even with your body. A proper sleeping position helps prevent neck or back cramps.  Keep an air filter in your bedroom to ensure that you breathe clean air while sleeping.    If you are a smoker, minimize the amount of cigarettes you have the day of the recording. If you are a drinker, refrain from heavy drinking the night before your recording session. Don't stop smoking suddenly just before a recording session, as doing so may create problems. Excess mucus may accumulate in your throat and nasal passage and may inhibit your ability to sing without a nasally, congested tone.    Don't wear out your vocal cords. Talk as little as possible the day before your recording session. If you need to communicate, consider using a portable marker board.    Room-temperature water soothes the vocal cords and opens up the esophagus. Ginger tea is particularly beneficial for the throat. Drink as much tea as you like to keep your throat relaxed and ready. Adding honey provides a bit of a coating for your throat. Drink plenty of water prior to and throughout your recording session. Don't drink ice water, as it can tighten the vocal cords. Refrain from drinking coffee the day of your recording session. The acidic properties in coffee are dehydrating and may have a negative effect on the throat. , Dairy and gluten can contribute to excess mucus that may cause problems.  Warm up gradually, loosening up the chest muscles, lungs and vocal cords. Find information on vocal warm-ups online or take lessons from a vocal teacher.	Know your part. Get plenty of rest. Use an air filter in your rehearsal space to prevent dust from getting trapped in your throat and lungs. Don't smoke or drink, as smoking and drinking are damaging to the lungs and esophagus and may pose long-term health risks to the throat. Refrain from talking or yelling. Drink warm water and tea. Avoid carbonated beverages, especially on the day of your recording session.  , Avoid dairy and gluten products for at least 24 hours prior to the recording session. Ease into the session with vocal warm-ups.
A 45 mph (72 km/h) speed limit is often a net speed of 30 mph (48 km/h), sometimes a lot less, in an area with traffic signals. The fact that you're moving along at 30 mph (48 km/h) in a 45 mph (72 km/h) zone should make no difference to your travel time, especially if you are almost never stopping.; , On sections of road where this is true, once you are moving with the flow of traffic, maintaining a given speed will usually get you through without stopping.  This is the opposite of what most people think, but absolutely works. A green light can be totally unpredictable. It might stay green right up until you're almost committed and then turn yellow. Green will betray you. A green light will tempt you to speed toward it and force you to slam on your brakes. When you are approaching a signal that is red, you are covering ground instead of idling at the signal. Well coordinated signals will typically be red as you approach then turn green shortly before or after you arrive at the intersection.  You know you'll stop at a red light, which makes it predictable, but it might just turn green, so if you slow down enough approaching it, you might never stop. At the very least, you won't have worn brakes and burned fuel keeping the car moving fast. Now it's only a matter of trying to work out how long it will remain red, and how long it will be green after that, and moderate your speed to be moving at the right rate when you reach the intersection to follow the other cars through without stopping at all (though not so fast that you can't stop if they stall, the signal doesn't behave like you wanted it to, or whatever other unpredictable things happen). You may also be able to tell from where you are that even though the light will turn green about when you get there behind the traffic, that you won't be making it through, and plan accordingly.  This takes 'fuzzy' experience, because it's different for most intersections and is different for different cars.  You can often tell fairly precisely what the next light will do after the current one changes.  If it's green or only just started flashing red, your green light is still 'fresh', and you might make it.  If you see these things, your green light will in all probability betray you.  If you have a green light, and the turn signal facing you just turned green, and there are still cars turning, your green light may be 'fresh' enough to make.  More often than not, you can't.  Each signal will likely be phased for a particular day and time, so pay attention to learn what each signal does on your commute.  Many parking lots have multiple entrances on different sides. With a lot on the left, if your traffic light has turned red, or is going to turn red, consider taking the a left turn instead of proceeding to a later entrance. If it's fresh and green, maybe proceed ahead to an uncontrolled left turn lane (depending on traffic) to avoid waiting for the signal to cycle all the way through to a left turn. Similar when approaching a lot on the right, especially if you are in a 'right on red' jurisdiction. Mind the pedestrians, though.  Most American cities are laid out like a grid. There are multiple paths/doglegs to take to reach the same destination, on or off freeways. Often some of these paths have fewer signals, or more 'friendly' signals. Balance this with the knowledge that every turn is usually a stop. At certain times of the day or week, an otherwise 'impassible' industrial zone with relatively few signals can be absolutely deserted.	Know approximately what your 'net' rate of travel will be, and consider that instead of the speed limit, or how quickly you can move from light to light. Know where signals are 'coordinated'. Learn that green is bad, and red is good. Discover that red lights are the most forgiving and the most beneficial things to see a ways up ahead. Get a 'feel' for where/when to start watching and predicting where your car should be when considering a traffic signal. Watch not only at the current light, but the next one and occasionally even the one after (if not too dangerous to do so, like when you're stopped and have nothing better to do), where signals are spaced closely together. Watch the pedestrian crossing signals. Watch the intersection for cars waiting on the crossroad, or in a left-turn lane facing you. Watch left turn signals for traffic traveling in your direction. When attempting to make a left turn yourself, if there is other traffic waiting in the turn lane for a left turn light, you can occasionally time your arrival such that the left turn light has turned green, and traffic is moving. Left turn signals can lead or lag the straight through green, especially along coordinated routes. Make opportunistic plans for entering parking lots. Make opportunistic plans for your route.
If an accident with a deer or moose is inevitable, here are some suggestions for lessening the impact:   Try to move to where the animal came from. This may take you away from it and the animal is more likely to keep moving forward rather than backtracking. This will only work if there is one animal. This will not work for deer. Shift your line of eyesight to that spot as well - don't look at the animal or you'll steer that way. Try to skim rather than fully impact the animal. Brake firmly, angle the car/truck and take your foot off the brake as you impact. The release of the brake will cause slight lift of the vehicle and this may be enough to stop the animal from rising into your windshield if your vehicle is tall enough. If you're heading into a collision with a moose, lean toward the door pillar. In the Mythbusters where they tested this, the center of the car was completely crushed in every impact but the triangle by the door pillar was intact in each accident. No guarantees are offered; you are far better off avoiding the collision.  There are some important steps to take after assessing if everyone is relatively unharmed:   Pull over if possible. Put your hazard lights on and if you can, put the headlights onto the animal or as close as possible. Check passengers for injuries and treat accordingly. Even if there are no injuries, shock will probably occur fairly quickly. Try to reassure one another and if it is cold, put on warmer clothing immediately as shock or fear increases the inability to ward off cold. If it is winter, stay in the car for warmth. Avoid going near the animal; it may kick or gore you from fear and pain. If it blocks the road, use your hazard lights and headlights and keep your car stationary. Only attempt to move the animal if you are 100% certain that it is dead. Use road flares or triangles if you have them. Call the police immediately or flag down help. Remember that most insurance companies won't pay for the damages you suffer from hitting a deer or a moose if you don't file a police report.	Diminish the impact if it is inevitable. Take care after a collision with a deer or moose.
Draw a simple shape on a thin piece of cardboard. Great starter shapes include circles, triangles, hearts, and leaves. Cut the shape out using a craft blade or a sharp pair of scissors., Set your fabric right-side-down on the ironing board. Place the double-sided interfacing face-down on top. Iron the interfacing according to the manufacturer's instructions.Double-sided interfacing has a shiny side and a matte side. Place it shiny-side down. Each brand will be a little different. Typically, you will need to iron the interfacing using a low-heat, no-steam setting for a few seconds.  Each piece should be a little bit bigger than your template. Don't cut it into your final shape just yet, however.  Go through each of your fabric pieces, and peel the backing of the double-sided interfacing off. You should now have four small pieces of fabric, with the right-side on one side, and the adhesive side on the other., Take two of your fabric scraps, and place them together, right sides facing out. Place the stack on the ironing board, and iron it for a few seconds. Repeat this step with the remaining set of fabric scraps.You should now have two pieces of stiff fabric, with the right side on both sides.   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the fusing. Typically, you will need to use the same heat setting, but iron it for a little longer.  The fabric scraps will be very hot and flimsy at first, but they will stiffen as they cool. Once they cool, trace your template onto them. Use a pen to trace the template if your fabric is light-colored. Use chalk if the fabric is dark-colored. Discard the template when you are done, or save it for another project.  Try to cut just inside the lines that you dress. This way, you won't have to worry about the lines showing. Don't worry about the fabric fraying; the fusible interfacing will prevent that from happening.  If you want to make statement earrings, consider making a larger hole, and inserting a small grommet or eyelet into the hole.   This method is for hook earrings. If you don't like hook earrings, simple glue the top of each earring to a blank post earring., Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop at the bottom of the earring. Do not pull the loop open, or you will warp it. Think of it as opening a door.   Consider inserting a jump ring first. Keep the earring hook intact. Instead, open up a jump ring using the same technique. , Close the loop by twisting it shut with your needle nose pliers. If there is a small gap in the loop, pinch it shut with your needle nose pliers.   If you are adding a jump ring: slip the jump ring into the hole, then add the earring hook. Close the jump ring using the same technique.	Make your template out of thin cardboard. Fuse your double-sided interfacing to your fabric. Cut the fabric into four equal pieces. Peel the backing off. Fuse two pieces of fabric together. Trace your template onto the fabric scraps once they cool. Cut the earrings out using a pair of sharp scissors. Use a thumbtack to punch a hole in the top of each earring.If you don't have any thumbtacks at home, you can use a pushpin or a thick needle instead. Twist open an earring hook. Slip the earring hook into the hole you just made.
If the guitar is dirty or dusty, take a damp (not wet) cloth or use a polish or polish treated handi-wipe (such as Murphy's Oil cloth or Fender / Gibson polish) and wipe it down, taking note as you go of the details.   Do you see inlay or detailed carvings in the wood? Is the guitar even made of wood at all? Or is it made of plasticine or particle board?       Are the tuning knobs ornate or heavy? Made of metal or bone, even? Or are they made of plastic or missing altogether?       What about the condition of the guitar? Does it appear to be old? New? In good shape? Heavy? All of these are clues telling you about the value of the guitar.       For example, if it has ornate carving or details, it is probably old or hand made, giving it more value. If it is heavy, it is probably made of a better wood. If it is in good shape, it is worth more than if it is missing parts or in need of repair.   Regardless of its shape, if it is a certain name brand of guitar, it may be of some value none-the-less.       Also, are you sure it's a guitar? Does it have 6 strings? If it has 4 (naturally, not missing 2 strings), it could be a ukulele. If it has 5, it could be a banjo. If it has 4 doubled side by side or 6 doubled side by side, it could be a mandolin or a 12 string guitar.      ; , Once the guitar is clean and you've made some observations about the condition and details of the guitar, observe the headstock and determine if you can find the name of the guitar's maker. What does it say? Gibson? Fender? Martin? All of those are reputable guitar makers.   Regardless, just because you've never heard of the maker doesn't mean it's valueless. However, the name of the maker can hold important details about when it was made, as some guitar companies are no longer in business and operated during distinct periods in history which might give you an idea of when the guitar was made.  Look inside the sound hole of the guitar (the big hole in the center of the body of the guitar, duh!) and see if you can make out any more details. Is there a serial number or a city or year written on the paper inside of the hole? Is there any paper or details at all? There may not be.  If it is an electric guitar, turn it over and look at the back. See if you can find a serial number or any additional details on any of the metal or parts.  Once you've gathered your details, write them down - the guitar's maker the brand of guitar if there is one (i.e., Fender Telecaster), the size, the weight ("heavy" or "light" is a good start), the type of wood if you recognize it, etc. Also make note of any damage. This might include nicks, dents, discoloration or fading on the paint, broken strings, cracks in the wood, missing tuning pegs, etc.  Do a Google search for the guitar maker and brand. If you can find it listed on eBay multiple times and the prices are within the same range, there's a good chance that's the value of the guitar. However, if your model is a bit different - if it looks older, better, somehow snazzier, it could be worth more. Don't take eBay's word for it; go to the library, music or antique store, pawn shop or talk to a guitar expert to get a 2nd opinion. A carpenter or woodworker might also have an idea of the value. The name of someone who works with, builds and fixes guitars is a "luthier", so do a search in your phone book or online to see if you can find one in your community.  You might try typing the name into Google and then clicking on "Image" and trying to cross reference it by the hundreds of photos that will come up.  If all these efforts leave you info-less, try going to a local open mic and asking someone with a guitar to give it a look. Look for someone who plays well or who looks like a hippie (long hair, beard, older, faint odor of patchouli).   Most guitarists appreciate seeing other people's guitars, especially if it's something unique or of value.  Now that it's all cleaned up and looking good, get a wall hanging guitar hook or a guitar stand and put it somewhere that it will be seen. If all your searches and hippie shake downs turned up nothing, eventually, someone will come along, pick it up and tell you everything there is to know about it.  You might not find the information you want to right away, but when you do, you might realize that you have a treasure on your hands, or you may find the thing is just a regular old guitar.   Either way, a guitar is a great item to have around the house. Even a poor quality guitar holds value in that when a person who knows what they're doing with it picks one up, it brightens the whole room.       Music can be played on any guitar in working condition, regardless of its value. Even worthless and broken guitars make great decorations, planters, canvases, art or sculpture material, props or can be sold for parts or traded for an item of personal value to you. There's a good use for any and every guitar.	Clean the guitar and inspect it. Find the name of the maker on the headstock. Try to find hidden details or a serial number if applicable. Make sure to inspect the back and bottom of guitar. Organize your findings. Research your findings. Compare it to photos of guitars you find. Find a guitar expert in a guitarist's natural habitat. Display the guitar. Be patient.
Say to yourself: "I take things as they are. I flow positive with my life." Feel the inner peace.  Move your thumbs. Visualize yourself as a Buddha (Shiva, Enlightened) and a Goddess of Love. Think or speak the mantra: "I am a Buddha (Shiva). I am a Goddess of Love (Mother of all beings)."  , Say "I send light to... (name). May all people be happy. May the world be happy."  , Think on the enlightened masters and say, "Om all enlightened masters. Om God. Please help me on my way."  , Make your mind calm and think the mantra "Om" in your head, your thorax, your belly, your legs, feet and in the earth. Think in the whole cosmos: "Om Shanti. Om Peace. Om Peace. Om Shanti. Om Peace ..."  , Simply sit there. Don't think. Relax.  For example, "I am optimistic. I go my way with optimism."	Rub your stomach. Put your hands together in the meditation pose in front of your stomach. Move your hand and send light to someone. Rub your palms in front of your heart. Put your hands on your legs or your belly. Stop your thinking for one minute. What is your positive thought now?
You want your candle to be small enough to float inside your jar. Your jar should also be large enough to hold some herbs and citrus slices.  Fill your jar about ¼ of the way with some fresh herbs. Consider using some herbs that repel insects, such as: eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, peppermint, or pine.  Take some lemons and/or limes, and cut them into thin, even slices. You want the slices to be ¼ to 1 inch thick. Cut enough citrus to loosely fill your mason jar.  Pour some cool water into the jar. Leave an inch or two of the jar unfilled.  Add about 10 drops of citronella essential oil into the water and stir to blend it.You can use more or less citronella essential oil depending on your preference.  Gently place the candle on top of the water in your jar. If your accidentally gets wet, do not worry. Either wait until it dries out, or dab the water off with a tissue, que-tip or cotton ball.  To use your citronella candle, simply set it on a stable surface and light the floating candle.   The citrus and herb water will keep for a few days, but eventually you will have to discard it. Consider placing a lid on the jar and storing it in the fridge when you are not using it to help keep it last longer.	Obtain a mason jar and floating candle. Cut some herbs and add them to your jar. Slice some lemons and limes and add them to the jar. Fill the jar with water. Add some citronella essential oil. Place a floating candle into the jar. Light and use.
You can do this using a rolling pin or even a glass bottle. The sheet should be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Avoid making it too thin, as it may break after it hardens. At the same time, avoid making it too thick, or it will take too long to dry.   You can buy air-dry clay from the craft store. Look for the kind that dries white; it will be gray while it is still wet, however.  If you don't have a cookie cutter, you can cut it out using a knife. As a last result, you can always form a flat heart using your hands.   This can make a wonderful ornament. Consider poking a hole near the top of the heart with a skewer so that you can thread some ribbon through it later.  Make sure that the "tiles" are flush with the surface of the clay. If they are sticking out too much, they may fall off.   If the clay starts to harden and crack while you are working with it, dip your finger in water and smooth the cracks down.  As the clay dries, it will lighten in color. Depending on how humid or dry it is in your area, this may take 1 to 2 days., You can even use a glossy decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge.This will make the colors of the tiles more vibrant. It will also help seal them into the clay and prevent them from falling off.   If you poked a hole in your mosaic, you can thread some ribbon through it after the varnish dries, and then hang it up.	Roll some air-dry clay into a flat sheet. Cut a heart out using a heart-shaped cookie cutter. Press some beads or tiles into the clay.You can also use glass gems or even sea shells. Wait for the clay to dry completely. Paint the piece with gloss or varnish, if desired.
You'll get sweaty and gross, so the least you can do is take a shower and put some body spray on. If you have long hair it's a good idea to wear a ponytail since your hair will get sweaty and will be in your face.; , Wear sneakers to help protect your feet because you'll get stepped on in mosh pits. Girls should wear shorts instead of skirts, as skirts may fly up if you're jumping around. Leave the earrings, necklaces, or loose things at home as they will get ripped, pulled, or broken. Wear glasses in mosh pits at your own risk; they could get broken as well. Also, if you're wearing plugs or other loose jewellery it's a good idea to take them out in mosh pits or at least tighten them before you go in Remember to consider the weather - if you wear pants and it's hot out, it will make for a sweaty and uncomfortable day. If the forecast calls for a sunny day, it'd be a good idea to wear sunglasses. No matter what the weather, always wear sunblock because you're outside all day and it's easy to get burned even if it's cloudy. Don't forget to put it on top of your head and ears.  Bringing the right items with you to Warped Tour can make the day go a lot more smoothly. It's important that you pack all of your stuff in a backpack or secure bag of some sort, because having to put all of your items in your pockets or carry a bunch of loose items around all day gets annoying and in the way. Make sure that your bag closes fully so nothing will fall out and so nobody can stick their hands in it to steal something from you. Some good items to bring are:   Money for the ticket and merchandise.       Paper and pen to write down the schedule.       Several water bottles.       A fully charged cell phone.       A fully charged camera (or an extra battery).       Sunblock and sunglasses.       Ponytail holder to hold your hair back.       Hand sanitizer or wipes.       Bug spray.       Sharpie (sometimes the band members don't have one).  Make sure to get to Warped Tour early, so you can get inside right when the gates open at 11 am. Arriving early will give you enough time to look at the grounds and memorize where certain places, such as the stages, information booths, and restrooms, are located.   Try to go to all the booths. Most booths give out free items such as CDs and pins, and the Monster Energy Station gives away free Monster drinks. Arriving early will also give you the best selection at the merchandise booths. The booths usually sell shirts, sunglasses, shorts, CDs, etc. Buying merchandise is a good idea because you can't get a lot of those things in stores and sometimes the band will be selling their own merchandise.  It is a big wall with all the stage names that have the bands and the times. Instead of running back and forth to see who is playing when, bring a piece of paper and pen with you to write everything down, or write it down on your phone. Sometimes they sell schedules at the front, so you could buy one there if that's easier.  Give yourself a lot of time to get to the stage they're playing at so that you can get a good spot before they start. How early to get there depends on how popular they are, so use your best judgement. Secure your spot and make sure you're able to see the band and that you aren't surrounded by people who could obstruct your view or get rough., Mosh pits can differ depending on what band is playing. For example, if it's a metal band, a circular pit will usually form in the center where people like to dance hardcore. Mosh pits are intense, so prepare to be rubbed up against a lot of sweaty people, including some greasy shirtless guys. If you can't take a pit, don't be in one. If you get in and then decide that they're not for you, or you accidentally get pushed in, edge away as fast as you can. If you feel like you're about to pass out or someone is about to crush you, put your arms in front of you and leave the pit through the side, saying "excuse me" as you go.  Mosh pits combined with hot weather will wear you out and make you sweat, so staying hydrated is super important! Water can get expensive, so be sure to bring your own water bottle. You will be able to fill it up whenever you need to. Many venues will not allow you to bring an open water bottle into the grounds, so ensure that your bottle's seal hasn't been broken yet, otherwise they might just throw it away. Also, avoid freezing your water bottle as frozen ones might be taken away as well. If your bottle gets taken away, find the Medical Tent and tell them you feel dehydrated. Most of the time they will give you a free bottle of water. As desperate as you might be for water, don't accept a drink from anyone except venue staff - you never know what that person might have put in it.  There are casual signings where you can have a brief moment with them, or you can try to meet them in front of the gates where their buses unload. If you are not allowed through the gate, this means that only the performers are allowed, and they will go through at some point (usually after they play, when they're going to get food, or when they've finished eating).   If you do meet a band stay calm. Avoid screaming, crying, or jumping up and down. Just walk up to them and say hi, and they will most likely say hello back. If they appear to be in a hurry, be as brief as possible and ask them for a quick picture, hug, or a signature. If they stay and talk to you, have a genuine conversation with them. Ask if they're enjoying themselves and what future events they're playing at. Don't brag about how big a fan you are. Instead, say something that will make them laugh, smile, or remember you in a good way.	Make sure that you are clean. Dress appropriately. Be prepared. Arrive early. Check the schedule. Go to your favourite band's stage early. Figure out whether you can handle the mosh pits. Stay hydrated. Try to meet the band.
; , The body should be a bit smaller and should be rounded and then made a bit more skinny  , This is easy. All you have to do is make a stubby little clay cylinder 4 times. Then stick the legs tight to your cat's body.  If you have made it here your halfway done! Good job.  Names like Rusty and Firepaw are great coming from the book. Other than that, names like Mustache cat are common along with similar silly names.  Make more cats, and give them names. Also, for bonus make mice maybe, or food.  If you have already made this or do not want to make this, go to the next step. You will need large amounts of clay and paint. Construct trees, lakes, fish, berry bushes, foxes, wolves, caves, rocks and more out of the clay and paint. ,	You will need to gather up: White or different colored clay and Paint. After you have got what you need, start making a medium sized ball for the head.Then make a body for the cat. Make legs for your cat. Bake them in the oven or let them dry overnight, depending on what clay you used. Name your cats. Start your clan. Make a clay forest as a bonus. Make stars, clouds, a blue sky, raining sky, etc.  , When all of this is completed and dried, you ready to play!
If swag hook should fall, will someone get hurt or will an expensive piece of furniture, etc. be damaged? If a plant, consider how much heavier it will become after watering, and if over watered, will the overflow damage electrical / electronic devices below?  , A typical hook will have a threaded hole, and be provided with inserts that thread into this hole. One insert will be threaded with fine threads on one end, and wider threads and a point at the other end. This insert is designed to be used when screwed directly into wood or plastic anchor (some times called a "molly") that has been pressed into a drilled hole in brick, concrete, etc. (not wallboard!). An other insert is a 2 or 3 (or longer) inch threaded rod - threads running the entire length, lacking a point. It is works with a spring loaded wing-like nut, and is called a "toggle" (or sometimes a "butterfly") nut. Many manufacturers include them for different uses and identify them for use in wallboard. They are actually designed for use in hollow walls constructed of durable materials such as cinder block. They have better success when used in vertical wallboard installations for light loads, but use in ceilings should be discouraged except the very lightest loads.	Consider the weight of the object hung by the hook. Determine installation hardware to be used, based on support material.
Traditional togas were made with wool fabric, but you can use cotton to make a good looking toga as well. Roman togas were typically white, but politicians and important people wore off-white togas with purple accents. You need a large amount of fabric to use for making an authentic Roman toga.Buy a piece of fabric that is four to six yards long. Four yards is a good length to make a child’s toga and six yards is recommended to make an adult male’s toga.; , You need to cut the fabric into a semicircle shape to be able to wrap your toga correctly. Lay the fabric out on a table or the floor. Use a pencil to make a small mark near the edge at the center of the fabric., Cut an arc from one corner of the fabric to the center mark. Fold the fabric in half, and then lay it back out on the table or floor with the cut side up. Cut the bottom side to match the arc of the top side. Unfold the fabric and the fabric should have one straight edge and one semi circle edge.   Your toga should be approximately 18 feet long with a semicircle radius around 7 to 8 feet.  Fold the edges of the fabric over 1 inch to create a hem. Use straight pins to attach the folded fabric over. Use a straight stitch on a sewing machine or a hand stitch to create a hem around the entire edge of the fabric. The hem will prevent the fabric from unraveling.   You can add a decorative edge of colored fabric as you create the hem by sewing a thin colored strip to the edge of the fabric along the curved edge of the semicircle.  Drape one end of the semicircle over your shoulder in front of you. The long end should be in behind you.The end of the fabric hanging over your shoulder in front of you should come to just above your ankles. The remaining length of the fabric will be behind your body.  The toga will wrap around the front of your body to cover your back and right side., The toga will now wrap around your entire body. The fabric will be open on the left side, but the bulk of the fabric will come together to cover you completely.   Pull any remaining fabric that is hanging on the ground around the left side of your body to the front. The fabric should wrap around your body snugly so it doesn't slip off when you move. Ideally the fabric will still be loose enough to appear full and flowing.  Secure your toga in place with the rope as a belt. The toga should cover your entire body except for your right shoulder.You can attach a safety pin where the fabric overlaps on your left shoulder to help hold the toga in place. Conceal the pin under the fabric to maintain the authenticity of the look.  A large costume jewelry broach can add flair to the toga. Consider golden or jeweled broaches to pin on the left shoulder to help hold the toga in place.  Braided ropes such as decorative curtain pulls can make a great belt for a roman toga. Double the rope to wrap it around your body twice to get a fuller look., Strappy leather sandals such a gladiator sandals are a good addition to a Roman style toga. Sandals fashioned from rope also provide an authentic look.  Fashion a headband from thin tree branches by twisting the branches around each other to form a circle. You can also use a decorative fabric like a golden lamé to create a headband by adding some elastic to a thin strip of fabric.  If you are wearing the toga on a cold night, consider adding a purple or golden velvet shawl or stole to cover your shoulders.  The only jewelry worn by Roman men was rings. Women also wore necklaces bracelets and earrings, however men kept their jewelry more simplistic.	Buy fabric. Mark the fabric to be cut. Cut the fabric. Hem the ends of the fabric. Drape the end of the toga over your left shoulder. Wrap the long end around the back of your body under your right arm. Hang the remaining end of the fabric over your left shoulder. Tie a rope around your waist to hold the fabric in place. Add decorative broaches or pins. Use a braided colorful rope as a belt. Wear sandals. Make a headband. Wear a velvet shawl. Wear rings.
Insight in essence is both knowledge and understanding derived from an "inward sight", or more simply, looking inside your own mind and body and observing it. It can be a natural process, or an intentional process as sometimes you need to see things differently to see them clearly, but most important is knowing which lens or style to use to make it clear.   When seeing and studying something, you might gain an understanding on how and why it happens simply by seeing it as it happens and not passing judgement. The more you watch, and the greater your depth of observation, the more information you can pick up. Knowledge is the understanding that is gained and is the part that you can use. In its simplest example, you might learn that fire is hot, but only through touching its heat. Likewise if you don't remember that it's harmful and use that knowledge next time you reach to pick up something hot, you will burn yourself. The skill is all about developing insight so it becomes more than basic survival skills, but a way to improve skills and our quality of life and learn things on a much deeper level of understanding.; , General mindfulness and meditation is a classic format when observing the mind and body but also for any subject you wish such as when gazing at a beautiful garden, complex poetry or art or when studying a recipe book, instruction manual or textbook. Its best to be aware that meditation (or any means used to gain an inward perspective) typically consists of two things:   1. The initiation of a laboratory-like or study field literally the moment you pay attention to it. Generally, everyone has practiced observation and had insights of various degrees throughout their life, but it generally is on a superficial level until the person decides to get to the bottom of the matter, or when they have observed so much of the subject it is more apparent. 2. When practiced to the degree of deep focus or absorption, meditation allows the mind to become far more clear, calmed and focused and can look at things without distortions or personal agendas.  Seeing a sample under a microscope is a lot more detailed and focused than just looking at the sample in the hand. Developing the mind through meditation as well as other methodologies both sharpen your focus and gives you a clearer boundary on the thing you focus on.   However, it would be inaccurate to conclude that very deep meditation is the only way to the goal itself although it certainly does help. You might see the finer detail through a microscope certainly, but an example to consider is how expert geologists can tell the quality and type of soil in their hand just through the naked eye, or by using specific gravity tests and other chemical analyses. These skills are learned through experience and testing their understanding. They might have used a microscope in their training and career, or they might never have done so. In this instance, it is like a bird with two wings, observation - such as meditation - is one wing, examining and understanding is the other wing. If the bird has only one wing it can't fly well, it will just go round in circles.  They typically arise more in an intentional, guided or an intensive style of study practice rather than those rare but life changing insights that simply happen. If you are familiar with them, you can at least recognize them when they happen and if they do pop up, arguably you can learn even more if you turn your attention to these very obstacles.   There is occasionally the idea that "the means to the end" is actually the "end" itself. The complication here is the process or relationship to the process has become more important than focusing on the subject. This can be quite a common experience many go through and some do end up going to universities and colleges all their life or studying the mind in meditation in a routine style, but never really making any breakthroughs. Try not to rush things. This is another common challenge as people hope to find a magic switch to get full understanding on their subject be it science, psychology, arts & literature and so on, or a cure for their troubles. As the metaphor goes, when the "penny drops" in the mind and things make sense, this often takes time to happen naturally. However, repeated observation and testing not only helps the penny drop sooner, but also the extent of the insight is broadened and many different facets can of the same experience can become clear. In this way, a person can learn to think and act more creatively and skilfully. Some also end up stuck with nowhere to go when the insight or knowledge gained is presumed as the goal itself. Insight is just one half of the story, the other half is doing something with it. Consider that a surgeon through his or her experience designs a new scalpel or forceps, but it's only until these tools are used in surgery that they are going to be useful. In the same way, care must be taken to continuously apply and test any insights gained as well as how to use them as practical tools, which in itself can expand the depth of understanding. The application of understanding relationships is most important, and it goes awry when people prefer to focus on the intellectual, rather than the practical. For example a chemist might discover a new medicine through testing samples, but if the treatment is never made available or ever taken by the patient, it does nothing. The medicinal discovery itself does not destroy the disease. In the same way, you have to apply your understanding to achieve the goal, for the discoveries are just a means to an end.  Test it out, observe and study your subject.   Be objective and look at everything as if you have never seen it before. Observe it as if it's a totally unique thing, but most importantly, observe your relationship or interaction with the experience and the object. The ways we can learn the most about a subject as well as how to gain the best outcome is to observe our relationships - how do we feel about the experience - is the mind open or closed to the experience? This helps you observe life more completely, rather than being selective, or allowing parts of the mind to cloud the issue. Ask yourself often to identify what you see, as you might not always know, even if you do identify it but a secondary feeling or idea arises, then identify that as well. Once you can identify them, you can explore them, just like once you've identified the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, you can start to put the puzzle together and you can gain practical understanding and skills. Luckily, in essence there are very few cases when the solution to many of our life challenges aren't already within the problem we experience - or in essence, our relationship with the problem. By exploring the foundation of the problem, a solution can be found, or if a solution is simply impossible, then a person can then start to come to terms with accepting the realities of life and finding a silver lining or creative opportunity if they are practical. In life aspects, many of our frustrations, unhappiness, depression and sorrows happen because we aren't looking at things completely and applying our understanding, or observing the issue to understand it. Generally it is wise to go back to the beginning and examine the central facts and test those in relation to what you see. You might be studying to gain an insight into a maths project, but if you are too tired or not interested then it is useful to identify this feeling as this is your relationship with the subject.  Sincerity is actually deep in the practice and benefits of understanding. If you are seeing something that is real and can be retested to give the same result, then you will have to satisfy yourself that it is what it is. It might mean consequently you have to let go of other ideas or wishes, but ultimately that is up to you to let them go, because you cannot progress beyond these hurdles. You have to climb over them until you can leap over them.  For example, it took a while until you could repeat the alphabet without error. Some people can learn it quickly, but these are very rare people so it pays to keep observing and learning.   Very often things can suddenly make sense (like a "light-bulb moment"), even things you have seen dozens of times before. Through life experience, your mind develops the tools needed to put together pieces of the puzzle, as well as identify different angles and ways that the experience can be improved. The mind is often able to relate what has been seen to prior experiences in order to make connections. By using an inward observation, eventually even this tool and skill gathering becomes apparent.  The ultimate goal is to become intimately familiar with your mind and body, how it reacts to certain things and how they inter-relate. The key benefit to knowing your mind so well is that you can take one glance at something and know instantly if it's of benefit or harm. You may then let go or avoid things that are harmful. It takes time, but it gets more effective the more you practice it––you learn more each time you examine something.   In a relationship context, insight and mindfulness - as the two wings of the bird - are useful everywhere; at work, school, home and all times in between. It has clear uses in empathy - being able to understand the challenges and issues we and other people face, and then relating and acting appropriately. In a work or business context, insight is also incredibly useful in any area requiring creative thinking as well as conflict resolution. Many of our problematic relationships between co-workers, or between boss and employees arise because we don't understand each other and the pressures both sides experience. It's these pressures and how we interact with them that limit compromise and flexibility, so by applying our insights we can find a middle ground as well as new ideas. In a mental well-being context, there comes a stage in most people's lives that the desires of our chattering mind becomes a common thread in the tapestry of life. As well, the understanding that it makes us unhappy and dissatisfied with what we have dawns upon us. Insight is important here in understanding how to let go of shallow desires by correctly identifying your true needs. As a stress relief tool, eventually what insight helps us to do is to learn what stress actually is, how to let it go of it, as well as forgive it and to become so practiced in both recognizing and letting go that you just release stress without trying. Then you are free of so many of your daily troubles. In a quality of life tool, what insight practices do eventually reveal is that every moment is absolutely unique and new, that every experience is fresh, even when we are tired, depressed and frustrated. This insight on its own rejuvenates the observation as its not like watching a TV show over and over, although it may seem like it. Its always different, perennially interesting and an opportunity to learn and understand some amazing things.	Seek to understand what insight is. Start to consider ways to be able to observe your subject. Consider this metaphor. Learn about some of the traps and misconceptions that can block the attainment of insight. Develop your levels of observation and the subsequent knowledge that arises. Be sincere. Keep observing the subject in order to improve both the depth of understanding and observation. Find practical uses for insight.
You can do this by putting a drop of hot glue onto the bottom of the wick tab, then pressing the tab against the bottom of the jar. You can also use some melted wax or a piece of double-sided tape instead.   If your wick doesn't have a tab at the bottom, you can buy a wick tab separately, and secure it to the wick using a pair of pliers. You can also tie a paper clip to the end of the wick instead. You can reuse jars from jams and baby food as well, but make sure that the walls are thick. If the glass is too thin, it may shatter.; , Alternatively, you can wrap the excess wick around a pencil, and place the pencil over the mouth of the jar. This will help hold the wick in place. You can also use pens, chopsticks, short dowels, or even popsicle sticks. If the mouth of your jar is small enough, you can even use a clothespin, and slide the wick through the spring hole.  If you don't own a candle-making pouring pot, you can use a large, glass measuring cut instead. To ensure that the heat is distributed evenly, consider placing a cookie cutter or jar lid under the pouring pot/measuring cup.  Heat the wax to about 170 to 180°F (77 to 83°C). Stir the wax often as it heats to help it melt evenly. Do not leave the wax unattended at this time, as hot wax is flammable.You will need about 1 pound (455 grams) of wax for a pint (475-milliliter) sized mason jar.  Let the wax cool to 140°F (60°C) before adding any color or fragrance.Once you have the dyes and/or fragrances added, give the wax a final stir to blend everything together.   You can add color with liquid or solid dyes meant for candle-making. Add a little bit at a time, and keep in mind that the color will lighten once the wax hardens. You will need about ½ to 1 ounce of fragrance oil for 1 pound (455 grams) of wax.If you can't find dyes or fragrances meant for candle-making, you can use a broken crayon and essential oil instead.  This is very important. If the wax is too hot, it may cause sink holes or cracks as it sets.Use a thermometer to test the temperature. If you don't own a thermometer, wait until the wax starts to thicken and resemble a slushie. This will take about 20 to 30 minutes., If you pour too quickly, you risk the wax splashing or forming air pockets. Make sure that the wick is centered as you pour., If you are in a hurry, however, you can let the wax set partway, then stick the jar into fridge for 20 to 60 minutes., Always keep something under the candle, such as a dish or candle charger; even through your candle is inside a mason jar, the jar itself can get hot.	Secure the wick to the bottom of your jar. Place two pencils over the mouth of the jar, to either side of the wick. Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a candle-making pouring pot into it. Add the wax into the pouring pot, and let it melt over medium heat. Consider adding some color and/or fragrance. Let the wax cool to about 130 to 140°F (55 to 60°C). Fill the jar to the neck, or until you have 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space left.Pour the wax into the jar slowly. Let the wax set for 24 to 48 hours.The bigger your jar is, the longer it will take to set. Trim the wick down to ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) before using the candle.This will help keep the wax from smoking as it burns and help the wick last longer.
Black Eyed Susan plants thrive in full sun but will also grow in partial or bright shade. They are not very particular about soil type or pH though, which makes them easy to grow just about anywhere, even if they have to deal with some shade.; , While they don’t necessarily care about the pH of their soil, they do prefer organically rich soil that drains quickly. If the soil is predominantly sand or clay, mix in a 2- to 3-inch depth of sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, compost or leaf mold.   This addition of organic matter will improve soil fertility, texture and drainage. Use a rototiller to mix the organic matter into the soil to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).  Plant Black Eyed Susan plants in early spring right after the last expected hard frost has passed. Plants are readily available at garden centers.   Black Eyed Susan can also be planted by seed. When starting from seed, sow them directly into the soil in your garden around the last frost date, or start them indoors around the end of February or beginning of March.  Sow the seeds in a half and half mixture of sand and sphagnum peat moss. Leave the seeds so that they are barely covered with the soil mixture. Keep them warm, between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 to 23.8 degrees Celsius), and moist until they sprout.   When the seedlings have two sets of leaves, transplant them into cell packs or individual pots.  Whether you grow your seedlings from seed, or purchase your seedlings at a nursery, you will have to give them enough space in your garden. Seedlings should be planted about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart so there is plenty of room for good air circulation around the plants after they reach their mature width. Increased air circulation reduces the likelihood of fungal diseases.   If the seeds are sown directly in the garden, thin the seedlings to 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart when they are a few inches tall.	Pick a spot that gets a lot of sunlight. Plant your susans in well-draining, rich soil. Select your plant date depending on whether you are growing your susans from seed or seedlings. Sow your seeds (optional). Make sure to give your seedlings enough space.
(Remote and RCA wires are always small.) People tend to underestimate the amount and size of wires that they need when installing many components in a car audio systems.   If you have the chance of using 6-gauge wires as your power instead of 8, then do so. It may save you a lot of time and money.    If you previously had a 1000W system, then that 8 gauge wire may work. But if you upgrade to more powerful amps and subs, say 3000w, that 8 gauge will burn and melt in no time at all. Then you will have to remove it, and rewire the car with 2 gauge wire. If you have a feeling that you may go bigger in the future, chose bigger wire. Multiple Wires can lead to ground noise. People with many components and wires running through their car can easily end up getting "ground noise," which is the whining sound that plays through your speakers and rises and falls with the rev of your engine. Although there are many products that claim to reduce ground noise, the best method is positioning the main power wire and RCAs/4-channel amps as far away from each other as possible. A large power wire can create massive amounts of electromagnetic interference that can be picked up by RCA's of a 4-channel, and subsequently relayed back through the radio and mids and highs as ground noise. Fix the problem by running the power wire to the left of the driver side seat and placing the amp and RCA's under the passenger seat.    If power is red wire, ground is black, and remote is blue, then you will have an easier time keeping track of your wires and what they connect to. Otherwise, if one amp fails, you may find yourself overwhelmed and needlessly tearing out wires.	Follow the general rule: for power, ground and speaker wires, the lower the number and thicker the wire, the better. Always use the biggest but most appropriate wire in case you decide to upgrade your sound system. Make everything color coded and neat.
Hold the coin by its edges: touching the surface directly can leave small scratches in the surface. If you want to protect the coin’s surface, don't rub it.  The higher your water pressure, the better. Make sure to not use a high-powered water jet that could go straight through the coin.  If dirt remains, lightly scrub the coin with a soft toothbrush and dish soap. Run the toothbrush under warm water to further soften the bristles. Rinse the brush and the coin frequently to avoid scratching the coin with the loosened dirt. Do not apply much pressure, and focus on brushing only the soiled area of the coin.   Toothbrush bristles come with varying degrees of firmness — you want one labeled as soft or extra-soft. If you use a firm bristle, you risk damaging the coin.  Especially on ancient coins, there may be dirt that remains after soaking and brushing. To remove this, use a small, sharp implement such as a toothpick or a precision screwdriver. Carefully pry and chip off the encrusted dirt, and try not to scratch the surface of the coin. You can spot-clean more precisely if you work under good lighting and use a microscope or magnifying glass.  Wait about ten minutes, then rub the vinegar off with a toothbrush. This may give the coin a more polished finish. Consider using anything acidic: lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and even sodas have been said to help clean rust off of old coins.   Consider adding salt to your vinegar/citric acid/soda. The combination of acid and chloride may make your cleaning solution even more powerful.  After soaking, thoroughly rinse the coin under very warm, running water. If the coin is clean enough for your taste, proceed to drying. Don't leave the acid on the coin, or it will keep etching and produce an unsightly green coating of copper salts.  Pat the coin dry with a soft, lint-free cloth, and then lay the coin on a soft, dry cloth to finish drying. Do not rub the coin dry.	Wash the coin under cold running water. Run the water over the coin for about a minute. Lightly brush the coin. Spot-clean encrusted dirt. Pour some vinegar over the coin. Rinse the coin again. Dry the coin.
This is the easiest newspaper hat design of all. , You can either fold the paper or not. If you fold there will be a crease in your hat and won’t have that perfect conical shape.  A single piece of tape at the edge of the cone will suffice, but you can choose to take the entire part where the two edges meet.  After taping the edges together, you’ll have a triangle piece left over. Cut it off.    Try adding tassels, string, or lace at the top of the hat to give it a truly princess feel. If you'd rather turn it into a witch or wizard hat just cut a piece of cardboard into a circle. Cut a smaller circle out of the bottom and slide over the cone hat. Cut to size. Or if you want to build a birthday cone hat, add cotton balls to the top. Color in the sides with bright colors .Make a trim out of construction paper. Cut a long strip that can reach around the base of the hat. Make small cuts all along the side to add texture. Then paste to the base.	Place a piece of paper on your table. Take the top right corner of the paper and bring it across to the left hand side. Tape the inside of the cone you’ve just created. Cut the excess paper. Decorate to fit your theme.
, By tilting your right foot in this position, you are able to depress the accelerator with your right heel while keeping the brake pedal engaged with your toes.  Shortly after beginning this maneuver, remove your right toes from the brake pedal.  Once you have some forward momentum, move your right foot so that it is in a natural position on the gas pedal. You may need to press the clutch back in momentarily at this point. With some practice, you should be able to work all three pedals with just two feet, reduce engine revs to a minimum, and avoid jerking the clutch.	Press the clutch down just enough to allow the engine to return to normal idle speed.         ,  Keep your right toes on the brake pedal, and turn your right foot inward so that your right heel is on the gas. Watch as the light changes, then press on the gas with your right heel and slowly let the clutch out. The engine will rev, and the vehicle will begin to move forward.
Dark hues have an amazing capacity to make a small room feel like a tiny cave. Instead, stick with cheery colors like sky blue, sunshine yellow, cream, aloe green, etc. (These are not real paint colors, or if they are it is coincidence that they are listed here--these were simply written as examples).   If light colors really aren’t your thing and you really want something darker, go with vibrant, bright colors like burnt orange, cherry red, or bright turquoise. These colors will make a bold statement without making the walls seem like they are closing in on a guest.      ; , Mirrors are an excellent way to make a room seem larger. If you already have a closet with a full-length mirror for a door, excellent! Do not replace it for anything. If you don’t have a mirror already installed, consider using mirrors as decorations. Make cool arrangements with odd shaped mirrors on your walls, or hang a large mirror somewhere. These additions really will help make your room feel like it has become larger.  If your tiny bedroom has features like a fireplace, or an odd nook, use it to your advantage. Use the top of the fireplace like a bookshelf. Or, if it is a taller fireplace that has been sealed off, place your bed up against it, letting the moulding of the fireplace act as a headboard. Nooks and crannies can be filled with chairs, a desk, or even a small built-in and cushioned bench for reading, particularly in front of windows.  As custom cubby design that incorporates your bed can go a long way in a small room. Imagine it as an extended headboard that doubles as a bunch of cupboards. Of course, its important to remember to build around your bed--leave enough room so that you can sit up in your bed against the wall without hitting your head on a shelf or cubby., Because your room is small, you will want to make it feel as open as possible. When too many decorations are hung on the walls, it can have a similar effect to painting your walls a very dark color--the room suddenly feels like a cave. Instead, go with a few wall decorations (like mirrors) and leave other decorations for the surface spaces.  For most small bedrooms, the focal point will either be the bed or the window. Because you don’t want these two items warring with one another for attention, its best to choose one as the focus of the room. Whichever you select, dress the other focus point neutrally. For instance, if you choose to focus on the bed, play the headboard space up with a few bright throw pillows and a fun duvet cover. At the same time, use neutral colors like white, cream, grey, or tan for curtains on your window.You can also create a win-win situation by placing your bed under your window--the two will combine into one pretty focus point.  While you may be inclined to buy a large bed (who isn’t?) you should probably stick to a smaller bed that can fit in the room without taking up all of the floor space. Fulls and doubles are generally the way to go in a small space. However, if your are decorating a kid’s small bedroom, definitely stick with a twin bed--they take up the least amount of space., If you really want to maximize your space, a loft bed is a great option. You can sleep up above and still have enough room for a desk, couch, yoga area, or any other item you are hoping to fit into your room.  If you are short on floor space, you might consider a floating nightstand. Purchase a closet shelf, which can be bought at a home furnishing store, and install it upside down on your wall. This will provide you with a place to store things, put an alarm clock, or add some decorative touches to your bedside area.You can also install regular shelves that will work the same way as the closet shelf, but won’t have the blocked ends to keep things from falling off.  If you do have enough space for a bedside table, try out a console table that has thin legs. Rather than having a bulky or cabinet-filled side table, this sleeker side table will take up less room while still allowing you to display keepsakes or place a lamp next to your bed.  If you want to put a TV in your room, opt for a small flat screen that can be installed on the wall, placed on a thin console, or kept housed in a bookshelf cubby. The key here is to take advantage of the thinness of the TV--place it somewhere where a larger TV couldn’t go (like on the wall).  Because you have such a small space, you will need to keep it neat and clutter free. While a pile of t-shirts might not look like much in a larger room, in your bedroom it could potentially look like a mountain. Make a point of keeping your area tidy by making your bed everyday, putting things away after you have used them, and hanging up clothes at night.It is also a good idea to have a laundry basket or bag somewhere in your room--like your closet.  If you find that you don’t have much surface space to put a light on, you might want to install some wall lights or hanging light. In particularly, hanging lights, like a funky chandelier, can really spruce up a room. Because they are hanging from above or off the wall, they also take up less space than a standard desk lamp does.  One of the most classic tricks to fitting everything you need into a small bedroom is by storing things under your bed. Of course, this requires your bed to be on a frame, which is a necessity if you are living in a small room. As for the boxes, boxes on wheels work well on wooden floors. Plastic storage bins are also great for under the bed storage.  Shelving units can double as footboards. Place a cushion on top of the unit and it can even become a place to sit. These shelving units can have cabinets, cubbies, or both, for storing things you want put away and things you want to display.  With a small bedroom you have to get sneaky about your storage. A headboard that actually acts like a cabinet is one of those great storage secrets. You can buy these types of headboards online or at home furnishing stores. Place it behind your bed, lift up the panel, and place the your stuff in the cupboard.You can also consider purchasing a headboard that has cubbies built into it. Place books, decorative objects, or bedtime necessities in the cubbies and cabinets.  It is best not to clutter the surfaces of your furniture with the little trinkets that you hold dear but don’t necessarily need to see everyday. Instead of having them out all over the place, try out some unique storage options that allow you easy access to them when you want them. One of the best options is the hollowed out book method. You cut out the center of the pages so that a chamber forms in the middle of the book. You can then put small keepsakes in the book and place it on your bookshelf or in a drawer of your bedside table.  If you don’t have enough space to hang shelves on your wall, why not make them inside your wall. To do this, you will need to cut a vertical rectangle out of the wall in between the studs in the wall. Once you have done that, you can recover the space with drywall or wood. In the insert you have now made in the wall, hang shelves. You have now effectively made a bookshelf inside your wall.You can also try out ‘invisible’ bookshelves. These shelves will help you store stuff you would normally put on shelves, without actually needing the wall space to put the shelves up. Click here for more information.  If you have an angled or triangular ceiling, there are still ways you can make that low space for you. Because the ceiling is angled, you probably won’t use the space where the angled ceiling meets the wall very often. Install a built-in row of cabinets and cubbies along the wall. While doing this will take up some floor space, it will also provide you with plenty of storage and surface space, allowing you to use other parts of your room for things other than storage.	Stick with light colored paints. Invest in a lot of mirrors. Work with what you have. Build a walled storage space. Don’t clutter your walls with decorations. Select a focal point of your room. Pick out a smaller bed. Consider building a loft bed. Try out a floating nightstand. Think thin. Stick to flat screen TVs. Keep your room neat. Consider installing hanging lights or wall lights. Invest in some under-the-bed storage boxes. Place a shelving unit at the foot of your bed. Buy a storage headboard. Get creative with your treasures. Cut out parts of your wall to make shelves. Work with your angled ceiling.
You will need a debit or credit card. At the end of that process, you'll be given a 5-digit code which will show on the screen as well as print on a piece of paper. You have five minutes to use that code to pull out a bike. If you take longer than 5 minutes, you'll need to get a new code (but you won't need to pay).  Check the tires and adjust the seat.  Pull the bike out when the green light comes on. Give it a good, firm pull.  All the bikes have three gears on the right and a bell on the left. Test the brakes.   Every bike comes with a front rack as well as front and rear LED lights that flash automatically. Note that the front lights are not bright enough to light your way, they are only there to make sure other vehicles can see you. If you're riding in a poorly lit area, wear a headlamp.  You will see a green light come on when the bike is locked in place. Be sure to push the wheel all the way forward and hold it in place until you see the green light. Many people find they need to use more force than they thought they would to make sure the bike locks into place.   Sometimes in the winter, the stations freeze, making it hard or impossible to dock the bike.	Follow the instructions on the touch screen. Find a bike you want to use. Type the code into the keypad at the individual bike station. Start riding!, Return the bike by firmly inserting it into an individual station.
Adjust your driving if in heavy traffic or inclement weather. Sixty mph may be safe when it's dry, but if a sudden rain falls, wetting the roadway and raising oil off the ground, it will probably be safer to drive at a lower speed.  While driving, avoid using cell phones, reading maps, eating and other distracting activities. If you are a passenger, sit up straight with your seat-belt fastened. Don't lean your seat too far back, don't put your feet up on the dashboard, and definitely do not distract the driver. Do not place objects on top of the airbag enclosure.  Observe the road looking for things that could end up causing an accident.   Look ahead for cars or pedestrians that may move into your car's path. Keeping a safe distance behind other vehicles (following the "two second rule" ) can help you have enough time to react when a vehicle in front of you makes an unexpected move. Stay away from distracted drivers (e.g., the guy on his way to work using an electric razor), tailgaters and other drivers engaging in risky behaviors. Keep an eye on parked cars. They may pull out in front of you; people may exit from them or move from between them without much warning.	Obey traffic laws and be conscious of current conditions. Focus on what you are doing. Anticipate potential problems.
Pop the caps off 15 acorns and toss the nuts into a powerful electric blender. Blend on high to pulverize the acorns into powder.You could use two large oak galls instead of acorns if desired. Instead of a blender, you could also grind the nuts into powder using a stone mortar and pestle.; , Place the powdered nuts in a small to medium non-reactive bowl. Add 1 cup (250 ml) of room temperature water to the powder. Mix to combine using a plastic spoon.   Note that the level of the water will need to be high enough to cover the bone you plan to dye. If you need to create more dye, you will need to add six more powdered acorns or one more powdered oak gall for each 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water.  Place one steel wool pad in a separate non-reactive bowl and add 1 cup (250 ml) of lemon juice or vinegar.   Note that 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of powdered rust could be used instead of a steel wool pad if desired. You may want to choose a container with a lid since this solution will sit out overnight without being used. It must be prepared now, however, and not immediately before use.  Place the bone in the bowl holding the acorn solution. Set the container aside and allow the bone to soak overnight, or 8 to 12 hours.   Make sure that the bone is completely submerged in the acorn dye. A longer soak time will lead to a darker dye. If you only want a light brownish-gray color, you can cut this amount of time down by about half.  When the bone has had enough time to soak, remove it from the acorn dye. Hold the bone over the container for a minute so that any excess solution can drip off.   Do not worry if the dye is not quite the right color when you remove it from the acorn dye. The chemical reaction that the dye undergoes when immersed in the iron salt solution will alter the color and set the dye. You may want to wear rubber or plastic gloves when removing the bone to prevent your fingers from getting dyed, as well.  Place the bone in the iron salt solution and allow it to soak overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.   The bone must be completely submerged this time, as well. As before, a longer soak time will produce a deeper tone.  Remove the bone when it has soaked long enough in the iron salt solution. Allow any excess to drip off, then set it aside for several hours until it feels dry to the touch.   Wear rubber or plastic gloves when removing the bone. Note that the final color will be slightly lighter than the current color. Lay the bone out on a piece of wax paper as it dries. Keep paper towels handy to clean up any stray dye.  When the bone feels dry to the touch, wash it using cool water and a mild soap.   Washing the bone will help remove the pungent vinegar or lemon juice odor. When you rinse the bone, continue rinsing it until no more dye can be washed away and the water is clear., Place the bone in a sunny spot and allow it to dry completely before you use it.   The completion of this step completes the process.	Grind the acorns into powder. Combine the acorn powder with water. Prepare an iron salt solution. Soak the bone in the acorn dye overnight. Remove the bone. Soak the bone in the iron salt solution. Let the bone dry. Wash the bone. Dry completely.
The richer the air to fuel ratio (less than 14.7/1), the cooler the combustion will be, the leaner the air to fuel ratio (more oxygen), the hotter the combustion is and more NOx is produced. These particular engines either equipped or not with an EGR system may produce excessive NOx due to a lean condition.  This device is located underneath the car in the exhaust system, between the exhaust manifold and the muffler., To check if the EGR ports are clear, start the engine and let it idle; using hot-gloves or a rag, reach underneath the EGR valve and push the diaphragm actuator rod upward. If the engine stalls or runs very rough, then the EGR ports are clear. If no (or very little change) occurs in engine RPM, then the EGR ports are plugged and must be cleared first (See repair manuals or Google it). Retest as mentioned., Air volume entering from the air duct through the air filter is measured by the MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor, usually located just before the throttle body and held down by three small screws.,,,,, Have the vehicle's emission gas retested to make sure it is in compliance with state guidelines.	Understand that NOx is produced in the combustion chamber at temps higher than 2500F. Make sure that if equipped with a catalytic converter, it has not been removed. Make sure the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation/Re-combustion) system is functioning properly, and particularly, that the EGR ports are clear. Now to the lean condition.Turn the ignition key to the "OFF" position.Remove the electrical connector from the MAF sensor.Remove the three screws and gently remove the sensor, careful not to damage the small resistor and wire at the opposite end of the sensor.Using carburetor cleaner or brake cleaner, spray the resistor and wire thoroughly, you can use a toothbrush but be careful not to break the tiny wire. Reinstall the MAF, making sure the screws are snug, and the electrical connection is plugged in completely.
We already have a general theme "Holidays!". Although, what type of holidays? Is it maybe Easter Holidays, or Christmas holidays? It is up to you! In this article we will focus on making a Christmas theme bracelet, but you can easily change the colours to suit your holiday!; , Colours are very important in a bracelet, and they should suit the theme. Probably the first things that come in mind for "colours on Christmas" would be green and red, and maybe gold. These are great colours and complement Christmas decorations/clothes.   Remember your colour theme for the next step.  Searching for the right beads are sometimes hard, which is why you must plan, because planning prepares you. First, have a look around the selection of beads that match your colour choice, and think of a plan in your head. What do you want your bracelet to look like? Will it have big beads and small beads, will it follow a pattern, or will it have a small charm in the middle, then follow red and green small beads?  , Before purchasing the beads, visualize some different variations of the bracelet you would like to make, then buy the beads when/if you are sure you are happy with the selection you have. It is a good idea to buy a bit more beads than what you need in case you switch ideas for the bracelet, but remember do not over-buy beads!  , Hopefully your beads are still in separate little baggies.   Do not dump them all into a big container! It will be hard to find them!  , Find the centre of your piece: On the string you are using for the bracelet, find the centre to use for separation, or where you will put a charm in the middle. No matter the design, it is good to know the centre. Pattern or no pattern? Choose if you like a pattern on your bracelet like "red, green, gold, OR red, red, green, green, gold, gold. No matter what the pattern it should be repetitive and you should not stop halfway through. Continue the pattern all the way. Plain is a choice: Sometimes, less is more! Some simple bracelets look beautiful, especially if you use a three stranded bracelet (which is a bit more difficult) and use 1 row of red, another of green and last of gold, but that is up to you!  , Now that you are ready to start, make sure you know who you are making the bracelet for, so you have enough string. Maybe measure their other bracelets, and leave a bit more space in case you need it. Remember, if you have too little string, you cannot add more, but if you have too much, you can always cut it!  , The process of making a bracelet is hard, so prepare to be patient and take some breaks once in a while!  , You can begin by tying a knot on the beginning of the piece, then continuing with beading. Stop every now and then to check out how your pattern is going. Remember to check the middle!  , Once the bracelet is done, secure the ends in whichever method you use, or get a grown -up to help you do the ends. Wrap up the present and it is ready!	Choose a theme. Choose colours. Look for beads. Visualize. Prepare a little workspace where you will start. Then, start with planning:   Your bracelet should be balanced: Do not have huge beads on one side, and small beads on another, because that is not balanced and will most likely look bad. Start the bracelet. Be patient. Start. Done!
This is a half-circle dome shaped gemstone-cut used for Jewelry making. You'll also need the cabochon tray, which is the metallic part into which the cabochon fits. Both items can be found in such places as craft stores, Jewelry suppliers or online sites that cater to Jewelry making.  You can hold it in your hand or place it on a concave item, such as a piece of foam with a dent in it. You could also use a big blob of poster tack attached to the rounded part and pressed against a non-slip surface. Use anything that will stop the cabochon from rocking as you work on it.  If adding glitter, do so now and use the brush to spread it about a bit. Allow to dry. Drying time will take about an hour.   Don't overdo adding the glitter. If it's lumpy, the cabochon won't fit snugly into the tray later. Instead of painting a layer, you might like to try a design, such as a love heart first, then paint a background layer over the design. This is more finicky but looks really effective. Another approach is to swirl different colors together across the flat part; take care not to mingle them up too much though, try to keep the swirls distinctive.  At this stage, it might be enough nail polish but you can decide that once this layer has dried. Two layers is often enough for strong, opaque nail polish colors, while another layer or two might be needed for weaker, more transparent polish colors. Again, allow to dry thoroughly between each layer.  This will ensure that it is completely dry.  Use a blob of strong glue and apply this to the tray. Press the flat side of the painted cabochon onto the tray, spreading the glue under the force of your pressure.   If any glue pops up around the edges, simply wipe it away before it dries.  When it is dry, turn it into a piece of Jewelry, such as a necklace, bracelet, ring or earrings.  It'll be an unusual piece that nobody else has anywhere.	Choose a clear glass cabochon for this project. Cradle the cabochon facing down on its rounded (convex) side. Paint the first layer of nail polish into the flat side of the cabochon. Paint the next layer over the dried layer. Let the cabochon dry overnight before adding it to the tray. Attach the cabochon to the tray. Allow the cabochon to fully dry in place. Wear your new piece of Jewelry with pride.
If you plan to design a bouquet, you will also need heavy wire wrapped with green florist tape to hold the roses together as a bunch. On the other hand, if you plan to just affix the flowers to fabric, a gift parcel or some other item, you may just need the leaves and hot glue.; , Artificial leaves come in all shapes and sizes so you’ll need to plan how many and what sized leaves you’ll need.   Take a count of how many flowers you plan to create. You will need approximately three leaves per flower.	Consider the size and placement of the flowers before assembling the supplies. Visualize the size of any arrangement you’d like to make.
These are available on the NED or MAST DSS websites.; , Although this can be done on a computer screen using Gimp.    The spiral galaxy will have spiral arms which will cross the line you have drawn at regular intervals. Make a measure of the distance between these intervals. You may use a ruler on a printed out photo and take an average, or use the measuring device in Gimp, or use MATLAB to extract the pixels along the major axis and apply a fast Fourier transform onto the extracted set of pixels if you are a geek.  The photo will also have its width given in pixels. Or, if you have used a ruler, you can measure the width of the photo in inches or centimeters. The purpose of this is to convert the measured interval length between spiral arms along the major axis of the galaxy into arc minutes. It is important to measure, or determine, this interval in arc minutes. And with a little algebra, this is very easy to do. You do not have to be a geek to do it.  Luckily, a vast number of galaxies have had their rotation speeds measured and these can be found online. Look for galactic rotation profiles or rotation curves and find one for your galaxy. There is a way to find out how fast a galaxy is spinning using line widths, but that is not covered here.   When and if you find your galaxy's rotation profile, it will be a graph of rotation velocity vs radial distance from the centre of the galaxy. The velocity of rotation will flatten out to some maximum velocity, almost always given in Kilometers per second (kps). You will need to measure this maximum rotational velocity as best you can in kps. Ignore every thing about dark matter; it is completely irrelevant. , That is the distance to the galaxy in parsecs. If you multiply that distance by 3.26, that is the distance in light years.	Find a clear digital photograph of the galaxy whose distance you wish to measure. Save the photo as a negative and print it on a printer. Draw a line along the major axis of the galaxy. Find the particular width in arc minutes of the photograph, which you will have used when selecting it from NED or MAST DSS. Find out how fast the galaxy is spinning. Multiply the interval measure in arc minutes times the maximum velocity of rotation measure in kps.  , Divide 3.12E9 by the result.
Oatmeal bath products are readily available and well-known as a remedy against itching.   Bathe in lukewarm water, and do so at least once per day for the duration of the rash. You could also try a soak with aluminum acetate. Products containing aluminum acetate can also be purchased at most drugstores.  Combine 3 tsp (15 ml) of baking soda with 1 tsp (5 ml) of water and mix until a paste forms. Apply this paste to infected areas.Baking soda is a natural remedy against itching associated with poison ivy. You can also take a baking soda bath to relieve itching caused by large poison ivy rashes. Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) of baking soda into a bathtub of warm water and soak in the bath until the water begins to cool.  Witch hazel extract, available as splashes and balms, can be applied directly to the rash.   This is an astringent product that tightens the skin, thereby relieving the itchiness of the rash and cooling it down. The product is natural and made from the bark of the witch hazel tree.  Aloe vera gels and lotions should be applied directly to the affected skin.   Aloe vera products are made from the inner part of the aloe vera plant. Compounds in this plant relieve itching and can accelerate healing.  Apply a thin coat of tea tree oil directly to the poison ivy rash, rubbing it into the skin until the oil nearly vanishes.   Tea tree oil is a natural anti-inflammatory. Applying it reduces the redness and swelling of the rash. The oil is a product of the Australian tea tree.  If you are near the ocean, stand in the water and gently rub some of the ocean sand over your poison ivy blisters. Once the blisters break, allow the ocean water to pass over the wounds.   This treatment dries up the poison ivy remarkably fast, and rashes may clear up within one or two days. Note that you must use natural ocean water. Do not use water from a fresh water source, like a lake, and do not attempt to mimic the effect of ocean water by combining water and salt.	Take an oatmeal bath. Make a baking soda paste. Apply witch hazel. Use aloe vera. Try tea tree oil. Wash with ocean water.
Cut two long, three-inch/7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) wide strips of fabric. Iron a long strip of interfacing onto the wrong side of the fabric to add support. With the right sides facing together, stitch each strip along the open edge, to form a tube. Attach a safety pin to the end of a tube. Pass the pin through the tube, while pulling the fabric right side out. Tuck in a half-inch/1.2 centimeter (0.5 in) of fabric, at each end of a strap and stitch it together by hand. Iron each strap flat. Top-stitch along "both" outer edges of each strap to add support. Attach the straps to the "inner" opening of the bag.  Place them at the center of the cuff to secure the opening. Place a button on either side, at the same point on the cuff, to use when the bag is reversed.  Your reversible tote is now ready for use either way around.	Add straps. Add a buttonhole and two buttons. Finished.
You can use just about any type of bottle for this. A large jug without a handle will work just as well as a milk jug with a handle. You can even use a regular water bottle!, Fill the bottle with water, then close the cap tightly. Shake the bottle, then pour the water out. Do this a few times until the water comes out clean. If there is a label, peel it away, then remove any residue., The size of the hole does not really matter, but it needs to be big enough so that you can cover it completely with your thumb. Something around 3/16-inch (0.48-centimeter) wide would be ideal, however.If you make the hole too big, you won't get a tight enough seal., If the bottle is made from soft plastic, you can do this with a nail or thumbtack.If the bottle is made from thicker plastic, you will need to use a drill and 1/16 to 1/8 inch (cc to cc centimeters) drill bit., Fill a large bucket with water. Place the cap on your bottle, then dunk the bottle into the water. Cover the cap hole tightly with your thumb, then left the bottle out.If your bucket is deeper than your bottle, dip the bottle only ¾ of the way. The bottle will only fill to the same water-level that's already in the bucket.  Carry the bottle to your plant, then lift your thumb away. This will release the pressure, and allow the water to flow out of the bottle. When you want to stop the water flow, simply cover the hole in the cap with your thumb.	Find a large, plastic bottle or jug. Clean out the bottle. Drill a hole in the cap of your bottle. Poke 6 to 15 small holes in the bottom of the bottle. Fill the bottle in a bucket. Unplug the cap to water you plants.
You need to begin by wrapping the Moby wrap around yourself before you create a hold for the baby. Hold the wrap in front of your navel with the label in the middle facing away from you. Fold the wrap in half and place it around your waist. The stitched edges from each half should be on top, closest to you., Take the two ends of the fabric and cross them behind your back. This should form an “X” over your back. The logo should still be in front of your navel. , Choose one of the ends and bring it across the opposite shoulder. Take the other end and bring it across the other shoulder, forming an “X” across your chest., Bring the fabric ends that are leftover around your back, forming a second, smaller “X” just below the larger “X.” Tie it into a knot. Or, you can wrap the excess fabric around to the front of your body, and tie the knot just below your navel.	Fold the wrap in half. Cross the ends behind your back. Make an “X” across your chest. Tie a knot to secure the Moby wrap.
A plastic bowl is lightest and probably easiest to work with but you can also cover a glass or ceramic bowl provided it doesn't have a crack in it (even hairline cracks can break without notice and spoil this project).  Labels from food cans or packages, magazine images, candy wrappers, tickets, or other items of nostalgic value or fun interest can be attached as the final layer of the bowl. Make sure that whatever you choose is enough to cover the inside and outside of the bowl.   Labels, wrappers, etc. that are crinkled need to be ironed first. Do this by laying the paper items on the ironing board, then placing a thin towel over the top. Iron on low heat, especially if the items contain plastic of any kind.  Overlap the rim.  A pitcher, jug, heavy glass, etc. can all serve as a suitable stand to hold the bowl aloft while you work on it.  Tear lots of small pieces of newspaper and add to a pile. You'll need enough to cover the bowl 5-6 times.    Dip the pieces of newspaper into the glue mix and smooth them all over the bowl, both inside and out. Let the first layer dry.  Let dry between each layer.  Hold the edges of the plastic wrap to help ease the paper bowl away from the real bowl. Set the real bowl aside to wash later.  Paint the bowl one neutral color (white is an easy choice) to provide a neat background. Allow to dry.  You can glue them in a pattern or simply add them at random. If creating a pattern, it's a good idea to sketch this out on paper first so that you have a guide to follow before sticking the pieces in place.   Be prepared to cut the paper decorations to fit your intended design. Overlapping them is also another option.  Let dry. Once dry, it is ready for display.	Choose a suitable bowl. Choose the cover design for the bowl. Cover the outside of the bowl with plastic kitchen wrap. Tip the bowl upside down over a stand. Prepare the first layers of the bowl. Mix PVA glue with water, the ratio being half of each. Repeat with up to five more layers. Remove the real bowl from the papier-mâché bowl. Trim the edges of the bowl to neaten. Glue the paper decoration items on the bowl. Finish by brushing over a layer of the PVA glue mixture.
Take along a measurement that you have already chosen; do this by measuring the area where you'll hang the ribbons., These are the wire joining rings used for jewelry making and are ideal for adding the prize ribbons to the chain., Thread a jump ring through this hole for each award ribbon., Use pliers to close it tightly. Repeat along the chain for each award ribbon.  You can place the ribbons in each consecutive chain hole, or space them evenly across the chain, allowing space for the size of the award ribbon.  Use hook hangers to hold the chain ends firmly in place.	Purchase a length of chain from the hardware store. Find jump rings. Pierce small holes at the top of the award ribbons. Thread the jump ring through one loop in the chain. Hang the chain up in your chosen place.
, You are now ready to continue knitting with your new ball of yarn.  When you've finished knitting, you will have a couple of yarn tails hanging along the side. To hide them it is easy to weave them in. Get a yarn needle and thread the yarn end through its eye. With the needle, weave the yarn in and out through the bumps at the side or the back of your piece.	To change yarn a different way, make a slipknot in the new yarn then pass the old yarn through it.  , Slide the new yarn up to the base of the first stitch and tighten the slipknot. Weave in the yarn ends. Snip the yarn close to the end for a beautifully tidy finish.
Mulch can be used in your garden. You can place them over seeds and plants for fertilizer and protection.   A six inch blanket of leaves can help protect plants over the winter from strong winds., If you have an existing compost pile, separate from the one you used to turn your leaves to mulch, you can add your mulch to this. The high nitrogen compost of mulch created with leaves can easily help break down organic material in a compost pile., Mulch can be used as a fertilizer in the spring. You can add a layer of mulch where you're planting new flowers and plants. This may help them grow faster.	Add mulch to your garden. Put the mulch in a compost pile. Fertilize your soil.
Start by making a slipknot and then make a chain of six or more stitches for your foundation.Six stitches might work well if you are using a bulky or super bulky yarn. If you are using a medium worsted weight yarn, then 10 stitches might be a good width. Experiment to find the ideal width for your headband., Skip over the first stitch next to your hook and single crochet into the second stitch. Single crochet to the end of the chain. This will complete your first row. You can work your rows in a stitch other than single crochet if desired. Single crochet is a good practice stitch if this is your first headband. Some other stitches you can try include:  Popcorn stitch Shell stitch Box stitch  , When you reach the end of your first row, you will need to turn your work over to work the second row. Chain one stitch. This will be your turning chain. A turning chain provides some slack to prevent the stitches from bunching up or puckering., You will need to keep crocheting your rows in the stitch of your choice until the headband is long enough to fit snugly around your head.Check now and then when the headband starts to get close to this length.  Cut the free end of the yarn and tie it to secure it when you are finished. You can leave the tail a few inches long and then weave in the end, or trim off the excess.  When your headband is the length that you want it to be, you can attach the ends or fasten them. You can either use a darning needle and some extra yarn to sew the ends together or you can hold them together with a safety pin or broach.  Another option is to leave a longer tail and use this to attach the ends. Thread the yarn through a darning needle or large eye tapestry needle and sew the ends together. Then, tie the end to the seam to secure it and trim off the excess.	Chain your foundation stitches. Skip a stitch and single crochet. Turn and chain one. Keep crocheting. Attach the ends or use something to fasten them.
You'll want to boost your drive, or gain. Pick slides are improved by a distorted tone; , These strings are the lowest and usually will produce a thicker tone than the high treble strings.  It should make that 'screech' sound.  Slide your left hand towards the nut and bring your right hand back to it's normal position.  Once you get the sound, keep practicing your pick slide until you think it's perfect. You can change it for song appropriation. Be it a fast slide for an up-pace song or a long drawn out one for a heavier tune, the pick slide is a diverse technique with many applications.	Set up your guitar as you normally would. Hold the pick like you normally would, and push down on the 5th and 6th strings with the pick. Slide the pick up the string at an even speed. Once you've reached the 12th fret, slap a finger from your left hand on the fourteenth fret. If you don't get that awesome, dull, low-pitched 'screech', change the position of the pick, pressure from your left hand, etc.
Your character can be from an American, Japanese, Chinese, or any other media. You could even cosplay as a member of the opposite gender or animal. It's really all up to you.;	This can be from a show, movie, game, comic, anime, manga, or even band.
Touching the front of your foot to the floor, but not bringing your heel down. Don’t fully shift your weight to this foot.When doing the Charleston, lean forward slightly and bend your knees a little. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet. A rock step, also called a break step, refers to a rocking step in which one’s weight is very briefly transferred to another foot before being returned to the first. The only time when you might begin with your right foot is if you are following a partner. When two people dance the Charleston together, the leader starts by stepping back on the left foot, while the follower starts by stepping back on the right, mirroring the leader.; , It should now be a step ahead of your right foot. This time, shift your weight to your left foot., Put the heel of your foot on the ground without bringing your whole foot down. Your weight should end up on your left foot still.  It should now be a step behind your left foot. Shift your weight back onto your right foot.  As you move, your arms should be swinging. This may happen automatically, especially if you’ve seen people do the Charleston before and know what it’s supposed to look like. When your left foot is in front of you, your right arm should swing forward. When your right foot is in front of you, your left arm should swing forward., It probably won’t look terribly impressive on its own, but the back, forward, forward, back motion is the building block for every variation on the Charleston. Practice until it feels natural. Then you’ll be ready to start mixing things up.	Take a rock step back with your left foot. Step back forward with your left foot. Take another rock step forward with your right foot. Step back with your right foot. Swing your arms as you step. Repeat this movement.
Remove the vacuum hose and inspect closely for wear (cracks or weak spots), then clean out the carbon deposits either with a spray can of carburetor cleaner or with a pipe cleaner if the deposits are hardened or compacted.; , Loosen any bolts fastening the EGR valve to the engine. Inspect the gasket lining the bottom plate of the valve. If it's not frayed or cracked, you can reuse it.  Use carburetor cleaner and a small-bristled brush like a wire brush, toothbrush or pipe cleaner to clean off the carbon from the metal exhaust gas return tube and the gas entry port on the valve (usually the smaller hole with a spring-loaded pin, or “pintle”).   If there is a lot of carbon build up around the EGR valve, you may also want to just save yourself some time and replace it with a new one.  The entry port is where the valve tubes connect to the engine (usually the intake manifold) while the EGR valve is off.  Check to ensure the vacuum diaphragm moves freely, reinstall the EGR valve and reattach the exhaust return and vacuum hoses.	Clean and inspect the vacuum hose. Inspect the EGR valve for damage. Clean the return tube and gas entry port. Clean out the entry port. Reinstall the EGR valve.
The leads are round or flat wires extending from the bottom of the transistor. They may be labeled on some transistors or you may be able to determine which lead is the base by studying the circuit diagram. , Read the display on the multimeter and note whether the resistance is high or low.  The display should give the same reading as when you touched the probe to the emitter. , Compare the reading on the multimeter's display to the readings you got previously.   If the previous readings were both high and the current readings are both low, the transistor is good. If the previous readings were both low and the current readings are both high, the transistor is good. If both readings you receive with the red probe are not the same, both readings with the black probe are not the same, or the readings don't change when switching probes, the transistor is bad.	Determine which leads are the base, emitter and collector. Clamp the black probe to the base of the transistor.  , Touch the red probe to the emitter. Move the red probe to the collector. Remove the black probe and clamp the red probe to the base.  , Touch the black probe to the emitter and collector.
Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently., Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner’s manual., Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.	Check your tire pressure regularly. Use the right specification of engine oil. Get your car serviced regularly.
Be sure that they're dry. If they're damp, hang them somewhere to dry first. Alternatively, use a flower press to press and dry them flat.; , Little boxes for sweets, soaps, biscuits, potpourri, jewels, etc., are ideal.  Each set will cover the four sides of the box and its lid. Keep the very best leaves to add to the lid.  The best place to put the glue is on the centre vein and nowhere else on the leaf.  Try to make a pattern in which each leaf can be seen overlapping.  For example, add a hazelnut in the shell, twin acorns, or a gumnut. Glue into place.	Find the leaves you'd like to add. Find a suitable box. Divide the leaves into five sets. Using a hot glue gun, glue the leaves to the box. Press the leaves into place. For the lid, find something else to attach to the lid on top of the leaves to add interest. Finished.
Have it match the pattern of your pouch, preferably stretchy and about 5 inches (12.5cm) wide., Sew along the long edge, transforming it into a tube., Scrunch up the fabric and move the pin through the tube until it pokes out the other end, then pull it out, bringing the fabric with it and folding the tube right side out., If you need a waist pouch, sew the tube onto the sides of your pouch and make it about the size of your waist. If you need a cross-body bag, sew the tube onto the top and sling it over your shoulder. You choose!	Cut a piece of fabric as long as you need the strap to be. Fold the fabric wrong sides together. Clip a safety pin onto one side of the fabric on one end of the tube, and drop it into the tube itself. Sew the tube onto any part of your pouch as a strap.
Use a computer program that allows you to draw and color in your own unique pony design. Use brush, pencil, or pen features in software like Photoshop to draw your pony freehand.   Try software like the popular Adobe Photoshop for the most advanced features, or free programs like GIMP or Artweaver that let you create your own artwork in a similar fashion. You can use many of the same principles you use for drawing with pencil and paper when you use computer art programs. Use an eraser tool within the software to erase sketch lines, or utilize layers to create different versions of your design to delete or edit.  Customize your pony using an online game or program specifically for designing My Little Pony-style characters. Choose colors, hair styles, and other distinctive markings for your pony before saving it.   Try a game like General Zoi’s Pony Creator to customize a large number of features on your pony and save it to your computer.Or use the similar tool to design ponies on Pony Lumen.Create a unique Cutie Mark for use in other pony designs on Hasbro’s official site for My Little Pony., Find pony templates online if you do not want to design your own. These will allow you to save or print the design and add your own customization with color.   Try printing out a pony template and color it in with your own colored pencils, markers, crayons, or paint. Or save a template to your computer and use a photo editing program to fill it with color. Note that a template won’t allow for too much customization of things like face and body shape or hairstyle, unless you draw in your own extra details by hand.	Design your pony with graphic design software. Create your pony with a pre-made program. Use a template and customize it.
It’s always advised to examine them by categories such as grouping them accordingly like dimes, nickels, pennies, etc. This will certainly make the work easier, quickly observing some differences of a coin to another if you evaluate them by groups. It is important not to get too hyped in the search, remember that if an error is too small then the value of the coin is not too much.; , Look out for missing letters, any doubling, and anything out of the usual. Error coins get these abnormalities during the production process; usually dirt affects the polishing and stamping process resulting to coins different from the others. Look at the face of the coin on both sides in different angles to easily see errors.  Finding errors like details with over-punches, re-punches and other doubling errors makes such coins valuable.  Doubling may also occur and try to find cracks, blank areas and other missing elements. On portraits, check on the details like chin, mouth, ears and eyes, doubling often also occur on these areas. Rim of coins should also be inspected where abnormalities also sometimes occur.  If the orientation of the coin is on the right side up at starting point, the orientation after the turn should also be on the right side up. If orientation changes, then the coin is considered valuable. The government takes great care when it comes to correct orientation to prevent error coins reaching circulation. This is why you should make it a habit to check orientation of coins every time you hold one with the simple over-the-top-turn technique.  Look for missing reeds, seams, inconsistencies on lines, and other abnormalities. Don’t forget to check on edges that have lettering because doubling may also occur.  Finding valuable coins becomes easier and faster in time because the eye gets used to spotting small errors with practice.	Sort coins according to denomination types. Examine the façade of the coin and its inscriptions, it is important to focus on the lettering and look for anything unusual or odd. Focus also on the mint-mark and the date indicated on coins, this is considered one of the greatest finds in errors in coins. Check major details on both face sides of the coin like portraits, structures, and the like. Systematically and slowly inspect the coin turning it from the top to the bottom not from one side to another. Don’t miss out on the edges of coins, using your palm roll the coin in order to have the chance to inspect all of the edges. Always set aside coins that give you even a little suspicion, if one is busy but spots or suspects that there is something odd with a certain coin set it aside for further inspection later.
Lay the artwork on a piece of acid-free tissue paper. Put another piece of tissue paper on the top of the artwork. Fold the sides and corners of the tissue paper and secure with tape.; , The pieces of cardboard should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger than the size of the unframed artwork.   Depending on the thickness of the cardboard and the delicateness of the piece, you may want to use multiple pieces on each side. The goal is to make the artwork non movable.    You want the cardboard to stay together, but you don't want it so impenetrable that the recipient of the artwork will not be able to easily open the package.  Tape the top of the cardboard together.  This statement alerts the shipping company to the fragile state of the contents.	Cover the artwork with acid-free paper. Cut 2 large pieces of cardboard. Tape the bottom and sides of the cardboard together. Slide the artwork into the cardboard package. Write "Do not bend" in large print on the front and back of cardboard package.
If you want to write a book, you've got to read a lot of books first. Listening to music and learning to play it is the first step in learning to write a song, especially a good song. Learn to appreciate the wit and structure of a well-written song. If you want to be a good songwriter, be a good listener. Check out some of the masters:   Classic pop: Jerry Leiber & Mike Stoller, Irving Berlin, Yip Harburg Pop-Rock: Randy Newman, Paul McCartney, Carole King, Brian Wilson Contemporary Pop and R&B: Michael Jackson, Max Martin, Linda Perry, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams Country and folk: Townes Van Zandt, Lucinda Williams, Kacey Musgraves, Hank Williams; , Unless you're Mozart, it's tough to write a good song in your head, or just on paper. Most songwriters have a specific instrument they like to compose on, to hear the music as it is played.   Most pop songs are written on piano and guitar, while other types of music are commonly composed on other stringed instruments or horns. You can write a song on any instrument. If you can't play an instrument, check out other articles to learn more about picking an instrument and learning to play.  Choose a key signature, and find the related chords in that key. Then, play around with the order of the chords to find something you like.   Stick to a major key if you want to write a memorable song. Of the ten most popular songs of all time, only one is in a minor key.Lots of songs are written with the I-IV-V chords, which means the chord based on the first, fourth, and fifth note in the scale. So, in the key of C, the chords C, F, and G all sound good together. This is true of any key.  Learning the basic scales for the major keys in your instrument is really helpful in learning to write songs. Learning to read music can help you be a better songwriter, but it's not absolutely necessary. Simple pop songs are often written by untrained performers.  Melodies won't be an exact copy of the chords in the scales, but will be based on those chords. Pick around the notes of each chord as you play to find a good melody, and explore the notes outside the chords but in the scale, as well.   To find a melody, lots of people like to hum along to the chords, or sing nonsense syllables or words to go along with the melody. Hum or whistle while you play, before there are lyrics., Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind," Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," and "Gotta Give it Up" by Marvin Gaye are all made of four chords or less. Most good songs are relatively simple, with a little quirk added to make it memorable. If you want to write a great song, it doesn't need to have five key signatures and fifteen time signatures thrown into the mix. Keep it as simple as possible.   Listen to John Lee Hooker play "Boogie Chillun'" and try to work out the chords. Give up? There's only one. The song is iconic because of the weird timing and rhythm, not the complexity of the melody or chords. Listen to Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give It Up" and compare it to a simple 12-bar blues song. See how the switch up to the IV and V chords is delayed a few bars? That's the kind of twist we're talking about.  When you're first starting out, learn lots of different songs and borrow the basic chord structures, but play them at a different rhythm, different tempo, and with different timing. Write different melodies to the basic chords. This isn't plagiarism, it's songwriting.   Learn a chord progression and then play it backwards and write a new melody. "Whole Lotta Love" backwards could be your new opus. Take all the chords from your favorite song and just play them in a different order until you find something you like. Lots of songs sound like other songs. It's not a bad thing. As long as you're not doing a straight-up copy of the rhythm and timing and melody all together, you're still writing a new song.  When you've got a basic melody that you like, keep playing it to yourself and letting your mind wander. What kind of mood does the melody have? What does the song remind you of? Start brainstorming possible lyric topics.   If you've written a whimsical or melancholy song, start thinking of images. What does the song remind you of? Who does it remind you of? What do you picture when you think of the song? Just start brainstorming on paper. Think of stories, think of characters, think of places, think of moods. Start writing little fragments and lines that illustrate those ideas. Alternatively, find a subject that complements the melody in a strange or interesting way. Warren Zevon's "Excitable Boy" sounds like an upbeat piano ballad, even though the lyrics are about a deranged serial killer.  Once you've got your theme or subject in mind, write out a few lines that you think are good to start building around. You can start with a chorus line that makes the theme or subject obvious, or just start writing the verses and find the chorus later.   Think of a powerful image or detail to start with: "Pistol shots rang out" starts Bob Dylan's "Hurricane," about a man falsely accused of murder." Or the iconic start to "Long Black Veil": "Ten years ago on a cold dark night / Someone was killed beneath the town hall light." It's also fine to just start sketching and free associating words. Because you'll eventually pair this with a melody, good lyrics don't have to make a whole lot of sense: "Wounded lover, got no time on hand / One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam" as the Rolling Stones put it.  There are lots of different ways to approach the chorus and make it fit the song, but usually you want the chorus to be the part where the theme or the subject is summed up in a tidy little phrase or sentence that sounds good to the ear. You might try writing for a while around a couple verses, then pick one that stands out to you as being the best to repeat, or try to write a chorus separately. Here are some good ones:   "A few good federales say they could have had him any day / They only let him slip away out of kindness, I suppose" from "Pancho and Lefty" by Townes Van Zandt "How does it feel to be on your own / With no direction home / Like a complete unknown / Like a rolling stone" from "Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob Dylan "Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be / Whisper words of wisdom, let it be" from "Let it Be" by the Beatles "Go, Johnny go! Go, Johnny go! Go, Johnny, go, go, go / Johnny B. Goode" from "Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry  , The hardest part about writing a good song is finding the right lyrics to match up with it. Most song lyrics include rhyming end words, but all songs don't have to rhyme. Learn a little about how to rhyme properly to get your song lyrics to match up with the music.   Most lyrics aren't formally structured into a rhyme scheme, but it depends on the song. An ABAB rhyme-scheme might be perfect for the song you wrote. Avoid cliches. Just because words rhyme doesn't make them good for your song. If the rhymes seem obvious ("I love my baby / I don't mean maybe") it's best to look for something else.  Many beginner lyricists write lyrics full of abstract ideas and not specific images. Give us something to see, don't tell us things. Avoid big concepts like "time" or "love" or "depression" in your lyrics, as well as mixed metaphors. If you're writing, "The bleak rage of my depression / Time is like a lesson" then try to make your lyrics more specific.   If you tend to write in abstractions, write out your big abstracts and describe what specifically they make you think of. What does the "bleak rage of your depression" look like? Sitting alone at three am, drinking coffee? Stabbing out a cigarette into an ashtray already overfull? That's better.  Use as few words as possible in your lyrics. Make them count. Unlike a poem, you don't have to fill your lines to the brim, because you'll have the addition of music. Use as simple a structure as possible in your lyric-writing.   Look at the lyrics to a song you really like. Without the song, they probably won't look that great, but they'll probably be simple and specific. Do the same with your song. Keep revising words away from your lines as you try to sing them. If something gets stuck in the mouth, figure out a way to sing the song without it.  Lots of songs are written in pairs. Jagger-Richards. Lennon-McCartney. Leiber-Stoller. If you've got a handle on the music-end of things, consider enlisting a lyric-writing partner to help give you a new perspective. If you're a better lyricist, hook up with someone who's a whiz with melodies.   Lots of performers, from Elton John to Elvis, didn't actually write most of their own material on their own. Writing with a partner is a long-proven effective technique.  Songs can be structured in lots of different ways. A basic song-structure, though, will consist primarily of alternating verses and choruses. The verses will usually change, while the chorus generally remains constant in most songs.   Choruses are usually the "hook" of the song. What's the part of the song that gets stuck in your head? What's memorable? That's the chorus. Repeat it at least three times to make the song memorable. A verse will usually, but not always, start the song. This allows you to build up to the chorus, which is usually the most catchy or memorable part of the song. Some songs have no chorus at all. Lots of rap songs, for example, are just flow. Some songs, like Bob Dylan's "Desolation Row" are just long verses, which all end on the same phrase, though there's not a typical chorus.  Bridges are a one-time variation of the chorus structure in the song, which happens about three-fourths of the way through the song, between a chorus and a verse, or between two choruses. It's just a way of shaking up the song.   In some kinds of music, like metal songs and high-energy dance songs, a breakdown is more appropriate than a bridge. This usually involves cutting everything but the drums and some vocals for a few bars, to get people moving. Often, bridges involve a switch into the minor key for a few bars.  Just because you've got a melody and rhyming words doesn't mean you've got a song yet. Learning to fine-tune the song by working out the phrasing is essential to writing a good song. Keep working on your song, singing it to yourself repeatedly, to learn how the melody can be adjusted in the voice, and how the lyrics can be tweaked.   Even if you're not a great singer, it's important to sing the song as the songwriter. Find a place where nobody will hear you, if you're sheepish about your voice. Belt it like Beyonce.  Songs are meant to be heard. It can be very helpful for aspiring songwriters to get feedback on their material, especially from other songwriters or musicians who appreciate music.   Playing a song for your family or close friends who aren't music listeners will usually not be that helpful. They'll usually just say, "I love it! Great job!" That can be good to hear, but if you want to write a great song, seek out songwriters for feedback. Record it and listen back to it yourself, if you're too embarrassed to play your song for someone yet. Listen to how it sounds. What could be better?  , Bob Dylan claims to have written "Blowin' in the Wind" in fifteen minutes, while Leonard Cohen claims to have never been fully satisfied with "Famous Blue Raincoat," even though the song is 40 years old.Don't stop working on a song. Keep hammering out the little details until it comes into shape. If you want a song to be good, it's not enough to be able to sing it.	Learn to play other songs first. Pick an instrument to compose on. Play around with chords until you find something you like. Explore other notes in the scale to find a melody. Make it as simple as possible, but with a twist. Borrow a basic chord progression and change it. Find a subject that matches the melody. Write a few lines. Find a chorus to repeat. Use a variety of rhymes. Make lyrics specific. Keep it simple. Consider writing with a partner. Structure the verses and the choruses. Consider including a bridge or a breakdown. Sing the song to work out the phrasing. Perform the song for an audience. Keep revising the song.
It is much easier to learn piano if you practice every single day, building off your prior successes and lessons. Even practicing for 20-30 minutes each day is better than only practicing once a week for a few hours. Everyday practice helps cement what you are learning. Create a practice chart with the time during the day you will practice and mark off each day you do. Place on a wall you pass often to remind you and don't forget to add a reward onto it when you have completed a certain amount of days. The more frequently you practice, the faster you will improve so don't take weekends off. Any practice everyday is better than no practice.; , Start with a warm-up. Just like athletic practices, your body and brain need 10 minutes to get going and reach their full potential. Some ideas for warm-ups include:   Run up and down your scales 3-4 times. Play 2-3 songs that you already know well, focusing on making them perfect. Play along to a song you know, or improvise some notes while listening to another instrument.  Metronomes keep a constant rhythm for you, helping you stay in time as you practice. Most musicians will unconsciously play parts they know faster and slow down for parts they don’t like. This may seem fine when you are on your own, but if you try to do this with a band the entire group will fall out of sync.   Start slow, around 60 BPM (beats per minute) if you are not used to using a metronome. Some music charts will list a BPM on the top, so set your metronome to this number to practice the song correctly.  Instead, focus on learning one section at a time, anywhere from 10-15 seconds, and perfecting it before moving on. This allows you to confidently play the entire song well, as opposed to rushing though it and missing your mistakes.   If you come across a difficult section, stop and work on it before moving on. It is difficult to lose bad habits once they are engrained.  Your goal should not be to get through a piece, it should be to play it perfectly. Practicing is the time to make mistakes, not take shortcuts, so try to find your mistakes and work on ways to fix them. If you struggle with a particular scale, make that a part of your daily practice until you have it. If you can’t play a fast piece completely, play it slow and add speed over time until you nail it.	Find time to practice every day. Prior to starting clarify the goal of each practice session. Practice with a metronome. Don’t try to learn new songs all at once. Focus on your technique as you play.
Put disk away and write down a title on the tape you copied to. Insert new disk and continue recording on the tape if you have free space. To record again, simply press record on the deck and the play button on the DVD/CD player as described in the previous step. Don't forget to turn everything off and unplug your equipment when you're finished!	When the CD is done playing, you can hit the stop button on the recorder and stop the CD from playing.
A teaching dossier is important if you teach at the university level. Oftentimes, a dossier is required to move up for promotion or tenure. It is a portfolio of papers, documents, and other materials designed the illustrate the scope of your teaching career. A teaching dossier should do the following:   It should describe your approach to teaching, as well as your philosophy as an educator.It should provide evidence that your teaching outcomes have been successful.It should also document that you have made efforts to improve as a teacher over the years., Compiling a dossier takes time. In order to create a successful dossier, you need to establish a timeline.   A minimum of two months should be spent on your teaching dossier. You won't be working on the dossier this entire time, but should be spending 4 or 5 nights a week working on compiling, writing, and organizing your materials.Be proactive while teaching. Always be on the lookout for potential materials to add to your dossier. If an assignment works very well to illustrate a point, save a copy of the assignment sheet and make copies of exemplary student work. If a class activity goes over well, have a colleague sit in during class and write a brief assessment for you., Each semester you teach, you should be working on collecting relevant dossier material. Relevant material is anything that speaks to your skill as an educator.   Have a folder or box in your office where you save important documents that you may want to use when compiling your dossier. Try to have some system of organization. For example, student papers can be filed in one section while assignment sheets are filed in another. This will make materials easy to sort when the time comes to compile your dossier.While the semester is in progress, you should be gathering all course materials, such as syllabi and handouts, feedback you've provided for student work, any TA training material, student work that shows students have met your teaching goals, mid-semester evaluations, emails from students or colleagues regarding your teaching, and any of your own notes or journal entries in regards to your course.After the semester ends, add raw data from course evaluations, students' final grades, and any notes you made about altering the course.You should also be continually gathering information unrelated to your specific course. Save materials from any teaching workshops you attended, information about student outcomes and activities (e.g., a student of yours being accepted into a graduate program, publications of former students, internships, professional jobs, etc.), any evidence you've been involved in professional organizations related to your field, and information from any non-university teaching experiences, such as public lectures., In addition to including compiled materials, you will need to write a statement of teaching philosophy. This is a 1 to 2-page document that outlines your goals and values as an educator.   The content of a teaching philosophy can be laid out in a variety of ways. There is no specific format that needs to be followed. However, all teaching philosophies should convey your idea of good teaching, what you hope to achieve teaching, examples of your teaching strategy that demonstrate its effectiveness, and reflections on how you can further develop as a teacher.The tone should be relatively informal although mentioning scholars who've been particularly helpful to you as a teacher can help. The document should be typed in a legible font with space between paragraphs., A dossier needs to provide evidence that your teaching methods are effective. The evidence sections are broken down into three parts.   Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness shows your approach to teaching is beneficial to students. You should include a summary of your course evaluations and an accompanying narrative, written by you. The narrative can explain any inconsistencies and help contextualize your scores in regards to your teaching. In addition to evaluations and your narrative, you might also want to include peer evaluations, student outcomes, and examples of student work.Evidence in Leadership of Teaching should speak to your ability to improve the quality of teaching beyond your own classroom. This is material that demonstrates you've made an effort to be involved in the teaching community and have collaborated with peers. Documents to include are materials from workshops and presentations, teaching materials you've shared with others, information regarding your participation in mentorship programs, any funding or grants you've received, publications on scholarly research regarding teaching, and evidence of any leadership positions you've held for teaching organizations.Evidence of Professional Development shows you're committed to improving and adapting your teaching throughout your career. You should include a list of any workshops, seminars, or courses on teaching you've participated in, and information regarding any mentorship or advice you've sought from peers and colleagues. You might also want to include your own narrative description of your career and goals, and how you've sought self improvement over the years., Items included in your dossier's appendix should compliment the claims you've made in your teaching philosophy and evidence section. A wide array of information and documentation can be included.   Some possible materials to include are student papers, course materials, feedback on teaching from students and colleagues, certificates of completion for professional development seminars and teaching courses, and any teaching research or scholarship you've participated in.These documents should not speak on their own. You should provide a brief, 1-2 paragraph statement that explains how said documents relate to your earlier claims., Once you've completed a draft of your dossier, have a colleague in your department review it. If possible, find someone who has reviewed dossier materials for professors up for promotion or tenure before. Feedback is invaluable. Not only can your colleague provide you with information on what to keep and what to cut, many academics get "typo-blind" when working long hours. A colleague can assure your teaching philosophy and narrative statements are free of grammatical and spelling errors as well as dropped words., There are a variety of common mistakes people make when compiling a dossier. As you work, know what to avoid.   Dossiers sometimes lack coherence. You may be asking those reviewing the documents to make too many connections themselves in regards to how the materials are related. Make sure your teaching philosophy, evidence, and appendix materials all speak to your central goals as an educator.Do not include too much information. A dossier should be expansive but it should not be exhaustive. Be selective in what you include and only include information that speaks to a few central goals and values.	Learn the fundamentals of a teaching dossier. Set a timeline for yourself. Collect dossier material. Prepare a statement of teaching philosophy. Select documents for evidence. Choose items to include in the appendix. Get feedback on your dossier. Avoid common pitfalls.
You'll be needing an actual camera for this if possible. If you don't have a proper camera, a phone or an iPod will work just as well, but you will get a better picture quality from an actual camera. It doesn't have to be a big, expensive one. Just a simple digital camera will do.; , It's better to fit the background to your character (can you really imagine Sherlock Holmes taking selfies in a bathroom mirror?). If in doubt, use your back garden or a large, outdoor area as you will usually get better light outside as well as more choice of backgrounds for your shots. Good place ideas for shots include brick walls, woods, lakes, or even simple park benches.  If you own a tripod, then that would be perfect, but if not, anything from a pile of books to a window ledge will do.  You don't want to have a beautiful photo of you in costume, but the top of your head is missing. If the camera is too low or high, adjust it accordingly. Also, be sure to check whether any large props will fit within the frame of the camera - that epic scythe you made will just look like a big black stick if the blade is cropped off the top of the shot.  Something that will fit the character, for example if you are cosplaying as Naruto, perhaps make a peace sign with your fingers and pull a huge grin. If you are cosplaying as Hermione Granger, perhaps bring a book with you and pretend to read. Try to be as creative with poses as possible; many of the same poses are used time and time again but a unique idea will make your cosplay stand out even if the costume isn't 100% accurate.  About 10 seconds should do it, so you can get into position. If you have a large prop to adjust or it is hard to move in your costume then you may need more time.  Remember, you don't necessarily have to be staring straight into the camera.  Some cameras have features that let you take lots of shots in quick succession automatically. You could try setting this on your camera too, for more interesting shots.  Never use the delete button on a camera. Digital cameras don't have a recycle bin; once you delete a photo, it will be gone for good. It is safer to get rid of the ones you don't want on a computer so if you delete one by accident, you can retrieve it from the recycle bin.  Now, don't worry if you don't have Photoshop. You don't need it for minor edits. Simply left click the photo you want to edit, click 'open with' and select 'Windows Live Photo Gallery'. Once this is open, click 'Fix' in the toolbar and then edit to your hearts content. You can change the brightness, colouration and even straighten the angle of the photo. You can also fix red-eye caused by staring into the flash of the camera.	Get a camera. Choose somewhere to take the photo. Set up a stand to place your camera on. Look through the lens of your camera to see where the edges of the shot are. Choose what pose you want to do for your photo. Set the timer on your camera. Pose for the photo. Once the camera has taken the shot, you can go and look at it. Upload the pictures to your computer and delete the ones you don't care for. Time to edit!, Congratulations, you now have a wonderful cosplay photo!
This method of folding perfect thirds uses nothing more than the measuring power of the human eye to find the spots where your paper folds into thirds. Despite this, it's surprisingly effective. In fact, once you've practiced it a few times, you can probably get away with using it for important correspondence.          To begin, you want to take one edge of the paper and double it up, bringing it across the top of the rest of the page. Don't make any creases yet — the edge you are about to fold should be gently rounded.  Try to line up the edge of the paper that you're holding so that it covers half of the paper that remains. The human eye is much better at judging halves than thirds, so it will be much easier to line up the paper correctly here than it would have been if you had attempted fold the paper into thirds from the beginning.          When you have the edge of the page lined up just right, crease the paper, making sure not to let the free edge move as you're making your crease.  The hard part of this method is already done. Now, all that you need to do is make the final one-third fold. Do this by taking the other edge of the paper and tucking it under the top edge so that it is snug against the inside of the crease. Make a second crease.          If you've made accurate folds, all of the edges of your paper should line up at this point. If they don't, feel free to make minor adjustments as needed.	Fold one edge of the paper over the top of the sheet. Line the edge up so that it covers half of the space. Tuck the remaining edge into the crease and fold in half.
While most sunflower varieties grow to be several feet tall, there are some miniature varieties that peak out at under three feet tall. Here's a list of popular varieties, large and small:    Mammoth: Their wooly namesakes may have gone extinct, but mammoth sunflowers grow just as tall as the prehistoric beasts, reaching a height of 9 to 12 feet (2.7 to 3.7 meters).  Autumn Beauty: This variety produces large flowers that grow up to six inches in diameter. It gets its name from the fall-like spectrum of flowers it produces. Bronze and mahogany flowers are not uncommon on these large stalks that can reach seven feet.  Sunbeam: Sunbeam is a medium-sized variety, standing at about five feet tall and producing flowers about five inches in diameter. Sunbeam flower petals are long and asymmetrical and the flower center is often yellow, making for a dramatic addition to any bouquet.  Teddy Bear: This miniature variety caps out at three feet tall and is perfect if you are tight on space in your garden.; , Sunflowers thrive in warm to hot climates with full sunshine during the day. Climates with long hot summers are perfect for growing sunflowers.  If possible, it is best to shield sunflowers from the wind. Plant sunflower seeds along a fence, the side of a house, or behind a row of sturdy trees. If possible, plant your sunflowers on the north side of your garden. This prevents the large sunflower stalks from shading other plants in your garden.  Sunflowers prefer a slightly acidic to somewhat alkaline soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. However, sunflowers are relatively resilient and can grow in most types of soil.   Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags and instructions available. After making adjustments to the soil, test the pH level again. If the pH level is below 6.0, enrich the soil using acid compost or planting mix. If the soil pH is above 7.5, mix in granular sulfur to lower the pH level.  Though sunflowers are extremely resilient, the one thing that can harm them is flooded soil.   Be sure that your plot has proper drainage, or opt to build a simple planter box instead. If necessary, build a raised garden box out of cedar boards, which come in 8-foot lengths. Cedar is a good choice for a garden bed because it won't rot when exposed to water., Plant sunflower seeds at the beginning of summer after the soil has completely warmed. This usually occurs between mid-April and late May.	Choose a variety of sunflower that fits your garden needs. Find a plot with full sun. Search for a spot sheltered from the wind. Check the pH of the soil. Make sure your soil drains well. Allow the soil to warm thoroughly before planting.
This number is the lowest PSI one would inflate the tires to and is suggested by the car's manufacturer. Read below for reasons inflation may be placed higher.          For most sedans, minivans, and even mini pickups, manufacturers generally recommend a PSI (pounds per square inch) in the range of 27 to 32, but can reach all the way up to 40.For larger vehicles that need to carry a larger burden, such as trucks and SUVs, the PSI is generally 4 to 8 PSI greater than it would be in smaller cars, perhaps around 45. Also note that the front and back tires may need different pressures, according to the manufacturer.; , The valve stem is a black or silver pencil-sized extension near the hubcap, about 1" (2-3 cm) long.  If there is a hissing sound, the gauge is not tight or even enough for an accurate reading. The angle of the gauge may need to be adjusted.          If you are using a digital model gauge, you may or may not need to press a button in order for the gauge to read the air pressure. If you are using a traditional gauge, the metered stick should give you a reading automatically.  The cap does not hold air in, but it keeps dirt and moisture away from the valve mechanism in the valve stem, which does hold air in.          Note that if the reading is the same as the manuals' specifications, you are done after checking all other tires for the same pressure. If inadequate pressure is in the tires then fill air in the tires. Make sure you put in the correct amount.  For all-around driving, the manufacturer's specifications are probably ideal, but adding a couple extra pounds of pressure into your tires may mean better fuel efficiency. Overall, adding a few pounds of PSI to your tires may make your ride a bit bumpier and less pleasant, so use with tact!   An increase in PSI can also result in uneven tire wear, longer required braking distances, and reduced handling. Make sure you don't over-inflate your tires.  One popular misconception is that the max pressure suggested by the manufacturer is all the pressure the tire can handle before it pops or malfunctions. In truth, the max pressure is the pressure at which the tires will carry the maximum amount of weight.  As soon as you inflate the tires past the max pressure limit, be prepared for the possibility of malfunction. If your tires are bearing heavier air pressure, a pothole at high speeds could spell disaster.  If you happen to be carrying a heavier load in your car, especially if you are traveling for longer distances, don't be afraid to add a few pounds of PSI to your rear tires to offset the added weight. When the weight is unloaded, release the pressure from the rear tires back to its standard specifications.  Cold weather will reduce the air pressure, while warm weather will increase the air pressure. It's therefore very important to check tire pressure when the seasons change.  Don't get lazy. It's very difficult to tell the difference between a tire with 10 PSI and 20 PSI. Plus, tires normally exhibit a bit of a bulge on the sidewall of radial tires. If you inflate the tires until the bulge is gone, you run the risk of seriously over-inflating your tires, past the point at which they get a performance boost.	Look in the owners' manual or on the inside of the driver's side door for the standard cold tire inflation pressure. Unscrew the valve stem cap from the valve stem on the tire. Press the air pressure gauge evenly onto the valve stem and record the reading given. Replace valve stem cap. Know that the manufacturer's PSI recommendations don't translate into optimum tire performance. Understand the myth about the max press value in the owner's manual or driver's side door. Add a few extra pounds of pressure to the back tires if you're carrying extra cargo, carpooling, etc. Check the air pressure of your tires as the seasons change. Never rely on the eyeball method to gauge air pressure in tires.
You can obtain suitable sunflower seeds from a local nursery or garden center. Be careful about the variety you purchase, though, as only dwarf sunflowers are really suitable for container growing. Suitable dwarf sunflower varieties include (and as names vary, ask your local retailer for specific guidance in your region):   Pacino: this bright yellow sunflower grows to about 30 cm (12") in height. Big Smile: this sunflower has yellow petals and a black center and grows to about 30 cm (12") in height. Teddy Bear: this sunflower grows to about 40 cm (15") in height. Sunspot: this sunflower has an amazingly large flowerhead (about 25 cm or 10 inches across) but is still a dwarf variety, growing to about 60 cm or 2 feet (0.6 m) in height. Music Box: this sunflower reaches about 60 cm (2 feet) and has lots of smaller flowers.; , The containers should be clean and sterile if you're repurposing them and don't forget to add saucers for catching the water. Gauge the size of the container needed according to the height of the flower you're planting, along with any other considerations such as how many sunflowers you'd like to grow per pot but some suggested sizes are:   If you begin in a pot with a very small radius, the sunflower will need to be transplanted fairly early on; some people do this to give the sunflower a head start while garden soil is still cold but be aware that sunflowers aren't very partial to being transplanted.30 cm-40 cm or 12"-16" width containers for most dwarf sunflowers should be sufficient.Window or porch box - a deep window or porch box can be ideal for a row of dwarf sunflower seeds. You'll need to thin out weaker seedlings early on (explained below). Large or mammoth sunflowers need containers of at least 18 litres or 5 gallons:  A milk crate can be used – just be sure to line it well or you'll have soil spillage. Half a barrel for really tall sunflowers. Obviously this will need to sit on a sunny porch or in the garden unless you have a sunny spot free inside the house.  First add a layer of drainage material, such as pebbles, gravel, terracotta pieces, or small pieces of polystyrene foam. Then pour in quality container soil such as a mix of compost and commercial soil mix. It should come to a level about 2.5 cm / 1 inch from the top of the container. Water it well.   Give consideration to adding water retaining crystals to ease the amount of watering required and to ensure that the sunflowers will get adequate amounts of water. Adding well rotted compost is important as a source of food for the sunflower, so try to do this if you can.  Sow 2 to 10 seeds in pairs, depending on the size or length of the container you've chosen. Not all of the seedlings will be kept, so don't worry too much about squashing them in at this stage but do be prepared to discard all the weaker appearing seedlings later. When planting, plant 2.5cm (1 inch) deep and at least 10cm (4") apart.          It is possible to fit about 8 sunflower plants into a container length of 90 cm (3 feet), so using this as a guide, you'd plant around 16 plants in such a container and expect to thin out about eight., Add about 25ml (0.83 fl oz) of water for every seed planted. Water once every one to two days in the same amount, depending on how moist the soil stays. Ensure that the soil is kept moist until the seeds sprout.  Germination should occur in the next three to eight days. If not, wait a little longer but by 13 days it is definite that the seed will not grow.  After germination, thin out the weaker seedling of each pair and remove any diseased or malformed seedlings. If space is an issue, move to additional containers but remember that sunflowers don't thrive on being transplanted.          Keep watering as before until each sunflower is about a foot (30 cm) tall, at which time you should double the amount of water they have been receiving.  A sunflower should be positioned so that it gets full sun all or most of the day; no sunflower can handle shade for most of the day. If you have the sunflower growing indoors, choose a sunny room but avoid placing it too close to a window because air near windows is often hotter or colder than the room temperature and this can be harmful to the plant.Try to keep the container away from extreme rain.  In two weeks the sunflower should now be a decent size.  The sunflower buds should now be just showing.  While sunflowers don't need additional feeding, giving them extra nutrition can give the flowerheads a boost. Apply a ready-made, branded general purpose plant fertilizer (follow the directions on the container for flowers) or an organic fertilizer like vermicompost or home made kitchen compost.  The bud should just be ready to bloom.  In many cases, you will find that the sunflower becomes top heavy and needs to be staked up to hold the glorious flowerhead up high. A simple bamboo or similar stake with plant ties will be sufficient to keep the sunflower's head up high. However, this should probably be anchored to something other than the pot unless you're absolutely certain the pot is strong enough to hold without falling over.You might tie the stake to a wall pipe, a bookcase frame, or similar objects inside the house, or to the drainpipe, wall or other objects if outside. Be aware that not all sunflowers require support – simply observe how your sunflower is coping on its own before deciding.           To get the seeds, you have to let the flower die on the plant and just wait. As the flower dries out, the seeds ripen and dry too. While this isn't very pretty, at least the birds can't take the seeds if you've got your sunflower indoors! If eating the buds, blanch them first to remove bitterness, then steam or boil for three minutes. They are delicious tossed in garlic butter.	Purchase sunflower seeds. Purchase or repurpose containers or pots that are suitable for growing the sunflowers in. Put the soil into the container, pot or window/porch box. Place the sunflower seeds in the container. Be prepared to water sunflowers more often than many other plants. Wait for the seeds to germinate. If germination has been successful, then well done!, Put the sunflower container in a nice sunny part of your house, garden or on the veranda (porch) if you prefer. Continue to tend the plant with water and general plant care. At this point give the sunflowers 75 milliliters (2.5  fl oz) (2.5 fl oz) of water. Fertilize if wished. In one month the sunflower bud should be still developing for the next two weeks (water regulation should increase to 100ml/ 3.3 fl oz of water). Enjoy the sunflower as a decorative element in your home or wherever else you've placed the container. If you want to make culinary use of the sunflower, the petals from the flowers make a pretty addition to salads, and both the seeds and the buds can also be eaten.
Take the product and place it into the box. Make sure that item is placed in the center of the box. Corner protection involves using air cushions to protect the corners of your product from damage. This is useful when packing large items like humidors.  Use two air cushions and place them in the two corners of the box. The cushions have two chambers that allow them to be bent in certain places.  Once the product is completely secure and cannot move, close and pack the box.	Place the product. Add the air cushions. Pack the box.
Do not allow any liquid to get inside the housing.; , If the lens is glued to the housing, do not try to pry it off as that will likely break it. Instead, remove the entire taillight assembly and follow these directions to remove the lens from the housing without damaging it.   Heat a kitchen oven to 200�F (99.3�C), and position oven rack in lowest position. Line a baking sheet large enough to hold the assembly with foil, and place the assembly on the baking sheet with the plastic lens facing up. Place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the baking sheet and assembly using oven mitts and carefully, using a flat edged screwdriver, pry the plastic lens from the housing. Remove the soft strings of glue from the edges of the lens while it is still warm using a sharp box cutter. ,, If necessary, apply a second line of glue when the first one dries. You want the crack to be totally filled and even with the surface of the lens. If you apply too much glue, sand off the excess using #200 fine grit sandpaper. ,	Clean the taillight lens assembly thoroughly by spraying cleaner on a rag and wiping down the lens. Remove the lens from the housing using the appropriate screwdriver. Wipe down the inside of the housing and the lens using a dry cloth.  , Sand the edges of the crack using #200 fine grit sandpaper to give the adhesive a rough surface to cling to.  , Apply a fine line of plastic glue along the crack, holding the pieces together with your hands for a minute to allow the glue to set up. Apply a line of plastic glue along the edges of the lens before replacing it in the housing and fastening down the screws.  , Reattach the assembly to the car if necessary.
You can order seeds online or purchase them from a nursery or garden supply store.   Varieties that are heat-tolerant and fast growing are particularly good for areas that where the temperature rises quickly.; , Fill seed-starting trays with pre-moistened, sterile seed starting mix, allowing approximately one inch (2.54 cm) of space from the top rim. Gently tamp down the soil so that it is firm in the container, but not hard packed., Place one or two seeds in the center of each section of the seed tray, and gently cover them with a thin layer of the seed starting mix.   Iceberg lettuce seeds should be sown approximately four to six weeks before the last day of frost in your area. You can stagger the growth of your lettuce by planting trays one to two weeks apart.  Place the seed trays in a location where they will receive at least six hours of sunlight daily and maintain room temperature. Water the trays with a spray bottle periodically to keep the soil mix moist without flooding it.Until the seeds begin to sprout, you can cover the seed starting trays with a layer of plastic film with small holes punched throughout to help trap moisture and keep the soil warm. The seeds should start to sprout within a week or two. If more than one seed sprouts in each section, thin out the weaker looking plants by carefully pinching them at their base.  Once your iceberg seedlings have grown to a sturdy four to five inches (10.16 to 12.7 cm) in height, harden off the plants by placing them outdoors to a wind-protected, shady area for a few hours each day, gradually lengthening the time each day.Hardening off helps prepare the seedlings for outdoor conditions, but be sure to bring them in if temperatures are still dropping below 32˚F (0˚C).  Once soil temperatures are above 60˚F (15.6˚C) select an area of your garden that drains well and receives about six hours of sunlight a day.   Raised garden beds help keep soil temperatures warmer and improve the growing conditions for iceberg lettuce.  Water the garden bed well enough to moisten the top six inches (15.24 cm) of soil. Dig planting holes equal to the depth of the seedling tray that are 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart in 20 inch (50.8 cm) wide rows.Add a small spoonful of organic fertilizer or compost to the bottom of each hole and cover it with a small amount of soil to avoid burning the seedlings.  Water the seedlings well and then carefully remove them from their trays and place in each hole. Gather the soil around the seedlings and gently tamp down the soil so that they are secure and even with the soil surface. Water the plants thoroughly without drowning them.   You can use seedlings that you have grown from seed or purchase seedlings from a nursery or garden supply store. Add a thin layer of organic mulch around the seedlings without letting the mulch touch the seedlings. The mulch will keep the soil moist and cool, and discourage weeds and pests from damaging your seedlings. You may want to trim the outer leaves of the seedlings to help the root system handle the transplanting and growth.  When the top inch (2.54 cm) of soil around the Iceberg seedlings is dry water the plants deeply, usually every five to ten days.   Avoid flooding the plants and keep soil from splashing against the leaves during waterings.  After a few weeks of growing, add a side dressing of organic fertilizer around the base of the plants. Continue to keep the soil moist and ensure that your plants are shaded from the hot, late-afternoon sun as the season goes on.   Remove pests such as slugs and snails by hand or use an organic deterrent.  When the heads are fully formed and firm, and before temperatures rise above 75˚F (23.88˚C), carefully cut the plant at the base with a sharp knife and remove the entire head.Harvest the lettuce heads in the early morning when they are firmest. Begin harvesting when lettuce heads are just larger than a softball, usually about two to three months from planting, and stagger your harvest so that you are only harvesting one or two every week or so. The inner leaves may feel slightly loose and appear light green, but the inner leaves should be tight and firm.	Choose a variety of iceberg lettuce. Prepare the seed starting trays for planting. Plant the lettuce seeds. Provide water and sunlight. Prepare the seedlings for transplanting. Choose a planting location. Prepare the beds for planting. Plant the seedlings. Water the Iceberg seedlings. Care for your Iceberg lettuce. Harvest your Iceberg lettuce.
It will help to be involved in the music scene in some way write a blog about the band, do a review on their music make sure you tag them in the post, tweet about them, follow them on Facebook and Twitter. The purpose of starting the blog is to establish some credibility. You are showing that the interview isn’t for your own personal gain and just to have for yourself but that you are going to help the band in some way. Everyone likes a free investment. If a band knows you are going to sit on an interview, without cleaning it up, editing it and posting it, they are not going to want spend time giving you an interview if they are not going to gain exposure or sales.; , Your best bet is to contact the band’s tour manager if they are out on the road and if not go after their manager. Either find an email address or get their digits. “You should be enthusiastic about it but not over the top,” says Don Runk WFCF 88.5 host of Kaleidoscope and Underwriting Director. You can also contact the band through email addresses listed on their website, Facebook or Twitter. If they are a larger band, look on their website for their press contact. If they are a lesser known band, you can email them directly. As a last effort contact their record label. This is not recommended because interview requests are easily misplaced which is the nicest way to say those jerks just don’t have time for us little people.  When you write your email use this format:   Hello Emily, my name is Lauren Luna. I am the Promotions Director for WFCF 88five Flagler College Radio. My station features Gold Motel. I was hoping to set up an interview with Gold Motel at their Orlando show. Please let me know if this is possible at your earliest convenience. Thank you! Lauren Luna  , Include contact information via email, as well as phone in your signature of your email so they can contact you in the form that is most convenient for them. Dan McCook, station manager for WFCF 88.5, says, “Become a pest. Make them give you that interview because you won’t leave them alone.” If you send an email and don’t get a response a week later, try a different contact at their label, Promotions Company, or management staff, through Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or a blog that they may run.  Do research. It will pay off. Know all you can about this band, what they stand for and what their goals are. Not only will your interview questions turn out better, but make sure they’re entertaining. You don’t want to bore them and make them feel like it is a chore to talk to you. Make sure you sell the idea of why this interview would benefit them. How many followers do you have? You can post a link to your blog to show them. Are you exposing their music to people who have not heard it before?  , Whether you interviewing them over the phone or at an upcoming show, do not lose contact. If the show is two months away, email every other week just to confirm that you are still doing the interview and the date and time. It is easy for them to forget.	Start a blog. Find contact information. Once you have obtained contact information get ready to put yourself out there and be prepared for hesitation and rejection. Plan out what you are going to say. Before you get a hold of someone for the love of all things good make sure you know what you are taking about. Lastly, once you have made contact, keep contact.
Look for pictures that have rounded edges or round them as you cut. Do not use pictures that will require a lot of attachments. As much as possible try to cut in one piece, only adding ears, perhaps bunny puff tail.; , Then on larger paper, make 2" squares and draw the picture into the larger squares copying from the smaller picture. Square off the picture or place on a window with graph over top and trace the picture outline. The same applies to make the picture smaller; use 1/2" squares (or as big or as small as you wish).  Remember, you will need at least 1/4" extra for the seam. Place the two material pieces right side together and sew seam. Bind the seam edges to keep it from unravelling. , You will want your toy to be squishy. ,, You can also use small buttons for eyes, yarn for whiskers or hair, pom pom for hair or tail. Again, remember that these add-ons can be very dangerous for children (or for animals) as they are a choking hazard.  To cut these out, you need to cut 1/4" around away from the edge of the picture for your seam. These are a good example of how detailing can be added with embroidery or fabric paint.	Use any picture from old magazines, books, etc. Make the picture larger or smaller using a photocopier to enlarge or by squaring off with 1" squares using a ruler. Cut two identical pieces for each toy, front and back. Stuff with beans or use polyester filling, whichever you prefer.  , Do not to over-stuff, if you fill with beans. Use the eraser end of a pencil to push the stuffing into corners (ears, feet, tail, etc) if you fill with stuffing.  , Fold the edges in of the remaining seam and sew shut.  , Embroider or paint a face on with fabric paint. Use these two pictures as an example; a Bear and a Bunny, from an old magazine and squared off. Finished.
If the engine is already cool you can begin work on your car.  Make sure your battery is disconnected before performing any work on your electrical system. You don't want a shock or even worse to fry your on board computer because of a shock. That would cost much more money., You will need to remove this cover. It consists of 3 - 5 little bolts around the top and a jubilee clip which needs to be loosened up before removal. Release any hoses that are attached to this cover to allow the cover to be removed completely., You should see 4 spark plug holders. You will see the ignition coils placed inside these holders. Don't pull them out of the holes just yet. You will need to unplug them from the ignition coil pack first as they wires are far too tight to just pull them out as they are.*Remember which order they go in as the wire may be too short at certain points., Now that they have been removed you will want to get your spark plug socket removal tool. You may want to use a long magnetic tool as it's a lot easier to get them out with one. Fit your socket tool over the spark plug and turn counterclockwise. At first it might be a bit hard to turn you may require a long cheater bar to help with this process., Once there off check the quality of the spark plug. Compare it to your new spark plugs to make sure you have the correct item., On modern spark plugs the gap has already been set and you can just pop them straight in., Now one by one gently place your spark plugs into your car engine head. Make sure they are tighten up to the correct torque to get maximum performance from your spark plugs. You can check your car owners manual on how you can do this., Check each ignition lead manually to see if they have no wear or tears in them if they do they will need to be replaced. Replace each on that is due for a change., Make sure you have not lost your bolts and re attached your cover, If all is done correctly you it should start perfectly first time and you should see a better MPG.	Park up your car on level ground and wait for your engine to cool down. Disconnect your car battery.  Open your car bonnet and locate your engine cover.  Locate the spark plug holders and remove the ignition leads (HT leads). Remove the spark plugs.  Compare your new and old spark plugs. Don't set the gap. Install the new spark plugs.  Re-install ignition leads. Re-attach the engine cover. Start the car.
It doesn't really matter what you use, just make sure that the photos are clear and high-quality.

Bird of paradise seeds take up to a year to germinate, and young plants may not flower for seven years. It's much easier to buy a bird of paradise plant or cutting rather than to start the plant from seed, but if you have patience it can be done. Look for bird of paradise seeds or plants in your local garden nursery.   If you live in an area where the climate is conducive to growing bird of paradise outside, you may be able to find seeds and cuttings in more than one variety. If you live in a place with cold winters, where bird of paradise won't survive outside, you're more likely to find a mature bird of paradise that has already been potted as a houseplant. If you prefer to plant seeds, get fresh seeds, soak them in water for three days (changing the water daily), and plant them while they're still fresh.; , Bird of paradise requires a steady temperature between 50-72 degrees Fahrenheit (10-20 degrees Celsius). If the temperature dips below freezing or gets very hot where you live, bird of paradise will die if planted in the garden. Luckily, it grows very well in a pot indoors, so you can enjoy bird of paradise no matter where you live.  Bird of paradise grows best in rich, moist soil that has been amended with plenty of compost so that it drains well. Good drainage is key to the health of bird of paradise. The plant will die if its roots stay wet and waterlogged.   If you're planting bird of paradise outdoors, till the soil in your planting bed to a depth of 12 inches (30.5 cm). Work in 4 inches (10.2 cm) of rich compost or other organic material in order to enrich the soil and promote good drainage. If you're planting bird of paradise in a pot, fill up a large clay pot (equipped with drainage holes) with rich, loamy potting soil. You can mix in a tablespoon of bone meal to make the soil even richer.  Bird of paradise requires full sun, so look for a spot that gets at least five hours of sunlight per day. It can survive in partial shade, but it flourishes in sun.   If you're growing bird of paradise inside, it's important to keep it in the brightest room in your house. When the temperature outside is right, you also have the choice to place the plant in a sunny spot outdoors; just make sure to bring it in when the air gets too hot or cold., Depending on the variety you have and the level of care you give it, bird of paradise can grow to be 5 ft (1.5 m ) tall. It's a large plant that takes up quite a bit of space, so space your plants about 6 ft (1.8 m) apart if you’re planting outdoors.  Inadequate watering is the most common cause of death for bird of paradise. It's very important to keep the soil evenly moist, but not drenched. Water the plant deeply one or two times a week, giving the soil time to dry out a little in between waterings. Aim to water give the plant about an inch of water per week.   From November through February, water just once a week. The soil should be kept a little drier in the fall and winter months. You can also mist the plant in order to keep the humidity up. If you're watering a bird of paradise in a container, water until it begins to come through the bottom of the pot. Be sure place a drainage dish under the container and discard excess water.  This helps keep bird of paradise healthy and happy during the spring and summer. Use a 10-10-10 fertilizer around the base of the plant every two weeks from March through September., The bird of paradise doesn’t require much pruning. You need only cut off old flower stalks at the base of the plant to keep your bird of paradise healthy. Do this in the springtime for best results., If you're growing bird of paradise outside, make sure aphids and other pests don't cause damage. If you see aphids on the stalk or leaves of your bird of paradise, pick them off and put them in a pail of soapy water. You can also rinse them off with a strong burst from the hose, and repeat as necessary.   Using pesticides on the plant may harm it, so it's better to take care of pests by physically removing them or rinsing them off.  If you live in a place where the temperature drops below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) in the winter, you'll need to bring your potted plant inside. Make sure to do so before the first frost of the season, or your bird of paradise may suffer.  A mature bird of paradise plant can be divided into two or even three parts, so you'll have a few extra plants to keep or give to your friends. Carefully remove the the plant from the pot, making sure not to damage the roots. You may need to use a spatula or another tool to help you remove the root ball.  You'll see smaller shoots coming off of the main stem or trunk. Follow them down to the attached roots and carefully untangle the roots so you can separate the plant into two or three parts. A bit of root damage will be inevitable, but try to cause as little as possible.   You may need to use a knife to help you complete the separation. Cut off roots that get bent or damaged once the plants are separate. A clean cut is better than a tear.  This step is not completely necessary, but it can help to increase the chance that the new cuttings will survive and grow into healthy plants. You can find rooting hormone at any garden center. Follow the directions on the product's package to lightly dust the ends of the roots with rooting hormone., Remember to choose a rich, well-draining potting soil, and fill each pot to within a few inches of the rim. Plant each cutting in the center of a separate pot.  This gives the cut roots time to form a light protective seal, which will keep them from getting waterlogged when you water. After two or three days, care for the plants as instructed above.	Purchase bird of paradise seeds or an adult plant. Decide whether to grow it inside our outside. Prepare your planting bed or a large pot. Make sure it has adequate sunlight. Leave room for the plant to grow. Keep the soil evenly moist. Fertilize the plant every two weeks during the growing season. Trim old flower stalks. Watch for aphids and other pests. Bring potted bird of paradise inside for the winter. Remove the plant from the pot. Carefully separate the plant where it naturally divides. Dust the roots with a rooting hormone. Re-pot the sections in rich potting soil. Wait two to three days before watering.
Use a ruler or a measuring tape to measure the distance from the edge of the pant legs to the hemline fold. Make sure both pant legs are cuffed to the exact same length. Use several more straight pins to hold both cuffs in place.  Use a hot iron (on the right setting for your pants' fabric) to make a crease at the fold where the pants are cuffed. Take your time and make sure the crease you make is straight.          At this point you may carefully try on the pants once more to ensure that the hem will fall exactly where you want it. Take care not to prick yourself with the straight pins.  This is where you will make a cut to remove extra fabric from the pants before sewing the hem. Use chalk or a marking pencil to make a mark 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) from the hemline around the entire pant leg. Repeat on the other side.  Use pinking shears, rather than fabric scissors, to make the cut. Pinking shears are designed to cut fabric in such a way that it doesn't become unraveled. Repeat with the other pant leg.          Take your time trimming the fabric. Make sure you don't accidentally dip too close to the hemline. When you're finished trimming, use straight pins to pin the fabric back in place about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the hemline.  Thread a needle with thread that matches the color of your pants. Use a blind stitch to sew around the pant leg about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the hem. Continue until you reach the place where you started, then knot the thread and use a scissors to cut it. Repeat with the other pant leg.          This process can also be completed using a sewing machine. To make sure the hem is nearly invisible from the outside of the pants, pick up only one or two fibers at a time on that side of the fabric.  Turn them right-side out and iron the hemline once more. Try them on with the pair of shoes you plan to wear with them. Make sure the cuffs look even and drop to the right length. If they need adjustment, rip out the seams and start over.	Measure the cuffs. Iron the cuffs. Measure 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) from the ironed hemline. Remove the pins and cut the fabric along the chalked line. Sew the hems. Try on the pants.
Though popular music can sometimes seem cookie-cutter (especially lyrically) in fact, there is no single "right" way to write song lyrics. Great song lyrics have been penned from an incredibly wide variety of personal viewpoints that run the entire gamut of human experience. Some songs are cheerful, others are furious. Some songs are laid-back and relaxed, others are tense and paranoid. Some carry great personal significance for the writer, while others are about nothing at all. However, nearly all great songs convey some sort of emotion. For starters, when you write songs, try to express the way you feel when you think about certain topics, events, or people that are important to you. Your lyrics don't necessarily have to mention these things directly, though they certainly can.   Let's examine the opening lines of two songs - first, Elliott Smith's "Between the Bars" and, second, Kendrick Lamar's "Swimming Pools (Drank)". Both songs are about alcohol addiction. However, notice that they take two different approaches to the same topic, Smith opting for an indirect, referential approach and Lamar for a more direct one. Both successfully paint powerful emotional pictures.   Between the Bars: Drink up, baby, stay up all night/With the things you could do, you won't but you might/The potential you'll be that you'll never see/The promises you'll only make   Swimming Pools (Drank): Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles/Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago/Some people like the way it feels/Some people wanna kill their sorrows/Some people wanna fit in with the popular/That was my problem     , So, you've been thinking about things that make you feel strong emotions and writing down your thoughts in the form of lyrics. You're already off to a great start. Next, you'll need to organize your lyrics into some sort of song structure - decide which words go in the verse, which in the chorus, which in the bridge, and so on. Many popular songs have lyrics that rhyme - if you want your lyrics to rhyme, you'll also need to decide on a rhyme scheme (the pattern by which your rhymes are arranged).  Once you've written your lyrics and organized them into a song, it's time to start thinking about how you'd like your song to sound. Again, there's no right way to write a song, but you may find it easiest to figure out your instrumental parts before tackling your vocal melody - this way, you'll be able to fit your vocals to a solid instrumental backing, rather than custom-composing instrumental parts to fit your vocal melody. Naturally, try to compose instrumental accompaniments that compliment the emotions conveyed by your lyrics.   Songs' instrumental parts range in volume and intensity - some are overpowering "walls of sound", while others are so sparse that they're barely audible by comparison. For example, compare My Bloody Valentine's "Only Shallow" to Nirvana's "Polly". These two alternative rock songs were released within just months of each other, but their instrumentation couldn't be more different. "Only Shallow" is a massive, swirling juggernaut of distortion, while "Polly" is a dark, hushed composition, featuring just an acoustic guitar, Kurt Cobain's voice, a short bass interlude, and a few drum hits.  In much of popular music, the singer's vocals are the central feature of each song, supported by the instrumental backing. Now that you have your song's lyrics and instrumental parts figured out, it's time to set your words to music. Give your lyrics a melody, or, perhaps more accurately, melodies - most songs have related, but distinct melodies for verses, choruses, etc. Though some musicians use the concept of discord (conflict between the notes or chords in a piece of music) to great effect, generally, you'll want your vocal melody to be in an appropriate key for the chords of your song.   It's certainly not impossible to become successful writing and selling a cappella songs (songs with only vocals and no instruments) or purely instrumental recordings. For instance, Shai's version of "If I Ever Fall in Love" is an a cappella song that spent time at #2 on the US charts. Similarly, the recent explosion in popularity of electronic dance music has made hits out of songs with few (if any) lyrics. However, the vast majority of popular music has both instrumentals and lyrics, so writing these types of songs may give you more mass appeal. Note that, if you're writing rap songs, you generally won't have to worry about vocal melodies, as "pure" rap vocals are delivered tonelessly. However, many hip-hop artists incorporate tonality into their songs in the form of sung refrains or half-sung, half-rapped verses. See Chance the Rapper's "Juice" for an example of this technique.  Many popular songs with uninspiring verses, tepid instrumentals, and laughable lyrics are saved by the power of a tremendous chorus (sometimes called the "hook"). Try to make the chorus of your song a particularly poignant, expressive, and concise set of lines. Generally, the chorus is the part of a song that people will remember the best, so make it emblematic of your song as a whole. Another way to tackle this is to think of your hook as your song's "thesis statement" - if you had to sum up the emotions behind your song in a few musical lines, how would you do so?  , Above all else, when writing a song, try to imbue your work with passion both musically and lyrically. Your songs should make you, as a performer, feel strong emotions - if you find yourself bored by your music, don't be afraid to start from scratch. Music is just as much a craft as it is an art - it's something to be honed and perfected with plenty of practice. The best way to motivate yourself to work at your songwriting craft, of course, is to be truly passionate about it.  Though some musicians (like, famously, The Beatles) have been able to transition away from live performance in favor of dedicating themselves entirely to studio work, very few, if any, have been able to become widely-known in the first place without ever performing live. To start building an audience and gaining recognition as a musician, it's important to put in work as a live act. To start, look for opportunities to perform in your local area. Bars, clubs, and cafes are the "classic" proving grounds for up-and-coming musicians, but they're far from the only places where you can perform. Any place or occasion where people gather can conceivably be an opportunity to perform. Weddings, birthday parties, farmer's markets, and even street corners can be places to build your audience and sell your music.   Don't be afraid to start small - all but the luckiest musicians paid their dues as local acts before making it big. One semi-recent example is Lady Gaga, who become a fixture of several NYC bars and nightclubs for several years in the mid-00's before getting her shot at the spotlight.  Nearly all serious musical acts should spend some time in the recording studio. Generally, in the studio, artists partner with a producer or engineer to create a finished product that's to their satisfaction. Recording your music gives you the opportunity to distribute it to your fans (in physical form as a CD or online as a file) in a polished, definitive form that's exactly how you want it. It also gives you the opportunity to give your music to the types of people who can help you make money from your music - namely, record companies and industry scouts. If you haven't recorded any music yet, you may want to record a demo as your first move. Demos are short (about 3-6 tracks) "mini-albums" that give you a chance to showcase your musical style - think of them as musical resumes for prospective employers.    Meticulously practice your songs before you step into the studio. Studio time can be quite expensive, so you'll want to be able to record each song in as few takes as possible. The costs associated with lengthy studio sessions can quickly add up, so try to get to the point where you can play all of your songs in your sleep before you attempt to record them. For the same reason as you'll want to have your songs down pat before you enter the studio, you'll also want to avoid excessive experimentation in the studio. For instance, don't let a producer convince you to waste time trying out countless effects pedals. The place for experimentation and improvisation is in the practice room.  Booking your own shows and studio time, negotiating your own contracts, and distributing your own music is time-intensive and requires a great deal of expertise. Because of this, many dedicated musicians decide to hire the services of a professional manager or booking agent to handle the business aspects of the music industry. Though this option may not be feasible with the average starving artist's budget, it can help a promising young artist maximize his or her potential and rise within the industry. Be sure that your manager is established and reputable - don't fall prey to scam artists.  When you've begun to gather a following and you've recorded a demo or two, you may want to try to sell yourself to record companies to win a recording contract. Though large, international record companies occasionally sign artists that are relatively unknown in terms of mainstream airplay (see: Epic Records signing experimental hip hop group Death Grips), obscure and up-and-coming artists may have more luck when courting smaller independent labels. Research labels that release the type of music you're interested in selling. Then, if they have a policy of accepting unsolicited submissions, feel free to send them demos, photos, interviews, reviews, biographies, and the like (if sent all together, these types of materials compose what is called a press pack, a standard method artists use to distribute their work and propagate their image).   Of course, perhaps the best way to get noticed by a record company is to generate attention for yourself through groundbreaking music innovation, noteworthy live performances, and/or a unique image. In other words, if you're able to generate fame (or notoriety) without a record label, record labels may come to you.  Performing your own songs in a live setting is important, but this is only one of the ways that musicians can gain professional clout. Musical artists can (and should) also try to find work as session musicians, soundtrack composers, and more - any opportunity to contribute music to another person's project or endeavor is chance to spread your name.   One oft-overlooked opportunity for artists to create original music for profit is in the world of jingle-writing. Advertising agencies regularly employ musicians to compose and perform songs for commercials. In fact, several music production houses (called "jingle houses") specialize in the process, using in-house musicians to create jingles for their clients.Especially when starting out, musicians may not have the luxury of being able to be picky with their employers. Don't worry too much about "selling out" - in some respects, it's part of the process of making your name as a musician. In fact, many now-famous performers with anti-authority bents originally took part in more "commercially friendly" music endeavors. Case in point: Tupac Shakur was originally a member of the light-hearted hip-hop group Digital Underground (of "Humpty Dance" fame).  Music is a more competitive field today than ever before. With the advent of online music retail sources, contemporary musicians don't just have to compete with each other, but also with the stars of ages past whose music is just as available to consumers as their own. To stand the best chance of being able to sell yourself as a musician, it's important to make sure that you stand out from the pack of modern artists. Don't make music or perform in ways that can cause you to be confused with another artist. Instead, break the mold and forge an artistic image that's uniquely yours.   This advice extends to your music itself as well as to the way you perform. Take pride in the flourishes and idiosyncrasies that are unique to your performance. Many successful musicians, like Prince, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, and countless others, had and/or have performance styles that are unforgettably indelible. The clothes you wear, the way you carry yourself onstage, and the way you play your songs all combine to create your image as a performer, so take time to develop these aspects of yourself as an artist.  Whether you're playing live shows or trying to move copies of your latest album, it's almost always in your best interest to reach out to as many people as possible. Advertise yourself as a musician using every method at your disposal - word of mouth (for instance, if you teach music part-time, try telling your students about an upcoming concert at the end of their lessons), self-advertising (flyers, etc.), and even cross-promotion with local radio stations are great ideas for promoting yourself. Also be sure to take advantage of your online visibility. Nowadays, a well-timed social media "push" can be a much more effective and efficient way to reach your fan base than conventional advertising.   The humble flyer is a well-worn method by which musicians self-promote. These can be easily massed-produced for relatively cheap with nothing more than a basic computer and a printer. Be sure your flyer includes any information your audience will need to attend your upcoming event - time, place, date, and admission price are essential. Also ensure your flyer is somewhere it will be noticed, such as a live music venue, bar, coffee shop, or college campus.  No matter how good they are, your songs won't ever sell themselves. Use every performance as an opportunity to sell songs - either by reminding your audience that you have physical CDs for sale or by directing them to a personal webpage, etc. Don't shrink from selling your music. If you put on a good show, you deserve whatever money you make from selling your music - you're not selling out by giving your audience the chance to support you.   The internet offers plenty of exciting opportunities for musicians to share and sell their music. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter let musicians keep in touch with their fans and notify them of new songs and live performances. Also, sites such as GarageBand and Soundcloud offer the opportunity for artists to host and even sell their actual music online.  Some recent artists have actually managed to become breakout successes primarily through the internet. For instance, Justin Bieber's path to stardom began when a record industry executive accidentally clicked one of Bieber's online videos by accident.  You have probably noticed that, today, most of the songs on the radio sound somewhat alike in terms of their sleek, flawless production style. This is a deliberate choice on the part of the songs' creators. A song's production values are a serious factor to consider before releasing it to the public - minor flaws like missed notes, background noise, and noticeable transitions between separate takes can become glaringly obvious with repeated listens. Though there's certainly a market for music with a lo-fi aesthetic, the market for sleek, polished recordings is undeniably bigger. So, at the very least, be sure to consider whether your music's production values suit your professional goals.   Some musicians have the experience and know-how to produce their own music - Kanye West and some of his peers in the world of hip-hop, for instance, produce many of their own songs. However, many musicians don't know how to "work the boards", so to speak. If you fall into this group, consider paying for studio time with a professional producer, who will be able to help you record and mix your music as professionally as possible.  Unfortunately, the music industry has a history of taking advantage of well-meaning musicians' kindness. Always be aware that unsavory tour managers, record labels, venue owners, concert promoters, and the like may be out to get you. Never let someone you don't know entangle you in a vague or poorly-defined agreement. Don't agree to work for free as a musician for the "possibility" of pay at a later date. Don't exchange your self-agency for the promise of fame. Don't let any managers or staff you employ make decisions for you without your consent. As a general rule, try to remain guarded as you navigate the music industry. Though many of the people in the industry are completely honest and ethical, all it takes is one legally-binding agreement with a bad apple to completely sideline your music career.   Contracts are a must. Oral agreements, even with people you're close with, aren't easily enforced. Always get any agreement you make in writing. If you're being asked to sign a significant binding agreement (like, for instance, a record deal), get the counsel of an experienced lawyer before signing.	Write lyrics with emotional meaning.

Disco clothing was made of stretchy, shiny material that readily reflected the bright lights of a disco club. Look for spandex, lycra, velour, and synthetic polyester. Also consider pieces heavily adorned in sparkly sequins or gold lame.; , Midi-skirts, which came up to the mid-calf, were also popular in the 1970s. Look for a design that flares out slightly starting at the waist. The skirt can have pleats, but does not need them. If you decide to go with a mini-dress, look for one with a halter style top.  The catsuit was a type of one-piece bodysuit often made of spandex. Typically, the legs were fitted at the thigh and flared out at the knee. The suit could have sleeves that flared out, starting at the elbow, or it could be sleeveless. Many catsuits also featured a halter top or deep v-neck.  Hot pants in the 1970s were daringly short pants that covered the rear, but barely covered any leg. The pants clung tightly to a woman's legs and did not flare out.  Not every woman exposed so much of her leg when she went to the disco. Many stuck with bell bottoms. You should still look for bell bottoms made of shiny, clingy material, however. Avoid bell bottom jeans, since these would have been too casual to wear to a disco.  Popular styles for the disco included halter and bandeau. For a less revealing option that covers your arms, consider a tight, long-sleeve top with sleeves that flare out from the elbow. Look for tops adorned in sequins, metallic leopard print, or other flashy prints.  Look for a pair with a 1 to 2” sole. Authentically, women could wear platforms up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) high, but these could prove hazardous to individuals unaccustomed to wearing such shoes. Look for bright colors or metallic patterns. Also stick with closed-toe designs, since these were more common to the time period.  Use a hair straightener to flatten your hair as much as possible, and consider adding temporary extensions if your hair is short.  While straight hair was slightly more common in the 1970s, large, wavy curls were also in style. Give yourself voluminous "Farrah Fawcett" curls if your hair holds a curl well.    Use dark eyeliner to trace your lids. Go with a color like black, brown, purple, gray or blue. Stay away from bright colors. Apply a liquid eyeshadow. Look for a darker color that really makes your eyes stand out.  Think chunky beaded bracelets and necklaces or medallion pendants. Look for shiny pieces that reflect light well.	Select the right fabrics. Try on a mini-skirt or mini-dress. Look for a 1970’s style catsuit. Wear hot pants. Opt for a pair of bell bottoms. Choose a shiny, clingy top. Pull out the platform shoes. Wear your hair straight and long. Alternatively, add volume to your hair. Use make-up to highlight your eyes. Wrap things up with shiny jewelry.
Many low-cost airlines provide great pricing when you’re searching for flights, but then hit you with hidden fees when you're ready to pay. Search the airline’s website for possible hidden fees and read the fine print before you check out.Don’t click “buy now” to book your reservation until you’ve looked the page over carefully for any charges (like travel insurance) that are automatically tacked onto your total. Often you can opt out of these charges and save yourself some money.   Be aware of the airline’s cancellation policy – often there are fees associated with cancelling a flight. If something looks too good to be true, it might be. If necessary, call the airline to confirm their fees.  Budget airlines usually have very strict rules about baggage and breaking these rules can result in a significant amount of fees. Always weigh and measure your baggage before you leave for your flight – don’t try to guess or eyeball it. Make sure your baggage stays within the boundaries of these restrictions.Check their rules on how many pieces of luggage you are allowed to have, as well. Many budget airlines enforce a limit.  The planes are older and the seats are usually smaller. You won’t have a lot of leg room. Low-cost airlines typically don’t provide complimentary food and beverages, wi-fi access or in-flight entertainment. Baggage rules are often very strict and can result in steep fees.   If you want to fly with a low-cost airline, you can’t expect the perks of a full-service flight.  Before you make a purchase with an airline you are unfamiliar with, look into the airline’s safety record, record of maintenance issues, the frequency of on-time flights versus layovers and so on. There is more than one website out there dedicated to airline reviews and ratings. To explore an example of one of these sites, visit http://www.airlineratings.com.  Testimonials and reviews will definitely let you know about any hidden fees that previous customers got stuck with, allowing you to avoid them more easily yourself. Keep in mind that reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.   However, look out for complaints that are repeated frequently by different customers – these grievances are most likely to be accurate. Go to the airline's website and look for customer review/testimonial links. If you don't see anything like that, do a Google search for reviews on the airline you're interested in.	Watch out for hidden fees. Double check and follow the rules about luggage allowances. Be aware of what low-cost airlines don’t provide.Budget airlines are able to offer such cheap prices because they don’t offer the typical perks that major airlines provide. Learn everything you can about the budget airline. Get insight from reading customer testimonials and reviews.These can tell you a lot about what your flight experience may be like when you use a new budget airline.
In many communities there are waste-reduction efforts to keep furniture, household furnishings, wood, paint, and building materials out of the landfill. Check your municipality for such programs. Also, if you ask people nicely at your landfill, transfer station, or whatever for what you need, very often they will look out for what you need and put it aside.; , Very often a paint color is mixed, but it isn't quite right for the customer. These are often available free or at greatly reduced price if asked. Be sure to thank them on your program and send a thank-you card.  Take some old sheets or canvas drop cloths (very white and no holes) and pull them taut over wooden frames. Make enough to cover the back of the stage. Prime them with a first. Enlist some help from some good artists at your school and make them into your backdrops.   Canvas or another such heavier fabric will make backdrops that are a little sturdier, which lets the backdrops be reused Backdrops from previous years can be repainted into new scenery, unless you want to leave them generic. Painted bricks could be a city scene, a castle, a cheap apartment, or quite a number of other things depending upon what is around them.  Find furnishings. For chairs, tables, and desks see if you can borrow furnishings that the school already has around, such as lunch table with a tablecloth over it as a table. Use a school desk as a desk if the style fits, or use some faux finish and make a cutout on some plywood or cardboard and attach it to the desk to make the style fit.   Ask the Custodian. Your school may have a roomful of old tables, old drop cloths, milk crates, and know where to find the best cardboard. Usually, only the maintenance people really know what's over there.  Remember that objects need to look like and suggest what they are, not necessarily be what they are. Thus, a tree or bush could be cut out of a piece of plywood and painted (be sure to support it securely and to construct it lightly enough to be movable).  Does somebody have an old sofa, a hat tree, a lamp, and so on?   Take good care of anything that is borrowed, and ask your fellow actors and crew to do the same. Label it if you can do so in a discreet and reversible manner, and keep a list of what belongs to whom, to make sure everything goes home at the end of the last show. Post fliers around your school, asking if anyone can bring in objects like a telephone, hand mirror, etc. Hold a scavenger hunt. Just make sure that you have permission to use all the objects you collect.  If you have little or no budget, ask if everybody involved in the play will bring in a little money (say $5 or $10) for props. Even a little bit can go a long way.  Some prop items can be used and re-used a long time. Things like old artificial Christmas trees, basic cafe-style tables and chairs, wooden crates, plain lengths of fabric, old suitcases and so on are fundamental prop items.  If you're planning on developing a drama program, start a prop collection so the next prop master doesn't have to start from scratch. Talk to the custodian about what space may be available to keep prop items. Catalog and list what's in there for the next show.  You can try a bake sale, redeemable can and bottle drive (especially in your own cafeteria) and the like. For the seriously creative, you can pledge you will drop your benefactor's name in the dialogue, offer to send "singing telegrams" to unsuspecting fellow students or teachers, or more.	Go To The Recycling Center. Check the Hardware Store for Paint. Make backdrops. Use What You Got. Remember the Power of Suggestion. Ask for loans and donations. Take up a collection. Keep an Eye for Multi-Purpose Props. Start a Prop Collection. Have a Fund Raiser.
The seeds of a particular tomato will lend fruit that are nearly identical to the parent. If you have an extra delicious or juicy fruit that you want to preserve, cut it up and save its seeds.   Make sure that the fruit you select is healthy; an unhealthy tomato will produce fruit that are similarly unhealthy. It is okay fi the fruit is bruised or has insects in it, just be sure that the plant the tomato came from is healthy. Wait until the fruit is at its very ripest before cutting for preservation.  Use a sharp knife to cut your tomato in half down the equator (running through the stem). Do this over a cutting board or bowl so that you can easily gather the seeds and juicy innards from the fruit for preservation.  Use a spoon to scoop out all the little seeds, juice, and soft, fleshy goop inside the tomato. Place all of this in a small bowl or cup.  The seeds need to go through a fermentation process before being dried, and do this by sitting in their own liquids. Cover the container with your seeds and flesh in it with a bit of plastic wrap. Poke a few holes in the plastic wrap for the air to circulate.   Do not add water to the seeds and pulp., Now the seeds need some time to ferment. Place the covered dish someplace that is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave the seeds in this location for two or three days and make sure to open the contain and stir them with a stick twice per day., After several days, you will notice that the juice and flesh from the fruit has created a scum at the top of the water, while the seeds have sunk to the bottom of the dish. When this has happened, scoop off the stuff floating near the top and then pour the seeds and water into a sieve. Rinse with lukewarm water, making sure that the seeds are completely clean.  Sterilizing your seeds will help to kill off any diseases and bacteria that might be growing, and help your plant to be stronger and produce more fruit when placed outdoors. Soak the seeds in a mixture of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of apple cider vinegar or bleach and 1 US-quart (950 ml) of water for 15 minutes.   You can do this with pre-packaged store bought seeds to make sure that they are bacteria and disease free as well.  Post-rinse, shake the seeds in the sieve a bit to remove as much excess water as possible. Then, lay them out on a tray covered in coffee filters or wax paper. Place these somewhere they will not be bumped or exposed, with temperatures in the 70’s. Use your fingers to move the seeds around once a day to keep them from sticking to each other or the paper.  When the seeds are completely dry to the touch and do not stick to each other, they are ready to use. Be careful not to pull seeds too early though, because if they are slightly damp they will grow mold, mildew, and bacteria that will spoil them., After they have finished drying, store your seeds in a paper envelope until they are ready to use. Avoid storing the seeds in a plastic bag or container, as these don’t allow as much air ventilation and are more likely to produce bacteria and mold in your seeds.Make sure to label your seeds with the plant variety and year as soon as they are dry.	Select your tomato. Halve the fruit. Scoop out the insides. Let your seeds sit in their own liquids. Stir the seeds twice per day. Rinse the seeds. Sterilize the seeds. Dry the seeds. Check the seeds. Store your seeds.
Maybe try to have a large permanent exhibition, and have a couple small temporary ones, so guests have something new to see each time. Try too choose theme which interests you or is relevant to subject of you objects. For ancient artifacts maybe archaeology, For taxidermy maybe the diversity of life. For rocks and minerals, maybe the Earth. For fossils, maybe prehistoric life or geology.	Once you have acquired, prepared, cataloged, labeled, and figured out how you are going to display your specimens, you can start designing you exhibit.
If you are selecting from seemingly identical karts, look for karts with fresher tires or from karts that have been winning previous races that day at the track. , This single tip is the most important lesson of fast go-karting. Winning a go kart race is about maintaining momentum throughout the entire track., You may think you are cool slamming on the accelerator, but sliding and jerking actually slow you down. Accelerate smoothly, brake smoothly to retain momentum and be faster all around that track. , For example when you are entering left turn you stay at the right side, then cut in the apex. Then drive to the right again. For a right turn, vice versa.   When you are just learning, it can help to follow a fast driver to duplicate her race line as closely as possible.  Sliding and drifting may look cool, but they aren't actually fast techniques for the beginner or intermediate driver.   Brake at the end of the straightaways before you enter the turn. If you start breaking during the turn, you will slide. Control your front tire grip. If your front tires stay in control, your kart will stay in the line you want. It can be OK to let the back tires slide a bit.  Don't pass when there is risk that you will end up in the tires.  Also, most go kart tracks will make you leave if you repetitively crash into people.  If you go a lap without crashing then push a bit more and you might gain some seconds. If you crash, slow down a bit. Also learning about its history if it's quite old and quite big can help you "get into touch" with the track.	Pick a fast kart (if you can), but be careful because if a kart is going too fast you may drift and lose control. Enter turns slow, exit turns fast. Be smooth. Plan your drive path as "out-in-out", the wide path will help you maintain momentum. Limit the sliding in your turns. Time your passes carefully. Do not crash into people, it may sound obvious know but out on a busy go kart track it is an easy mistake to make. Learn your way round the track and its history.

Isopropyl rubbing alcohol will effectively kill spider mites. Simply pour a little of the rubbing alcohol onto a clean cloth and use it to wipe the underside of the infested plant's leaves.  There are sprays or wipes available from garden centers and hardware stores. Use according to the manufacturer's instructions.   If spraying specific chemicals (such as dienochlor, dicofol, azocyclotin, fenbutatin, bromopropylate, propagate), it is recommended that you do not use the same product more than three times per growing season. This will help reduce the chances of the mites gaining resistance against the chemicals.  Spraying liquid sulfur is another option for getting rid of spider mites. Do not use powdered sulfur because it can get into the air and you or someone else might inhale it. Make sure that you do not spray liquid sulfur within 30 days of using an oil on your plants or in temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.	Use rubbing alcohol. Purchase a proprietary product suitable for outdoor spider mites. Try getting rid of the mites with liquid sulfur.
You can use food coloring or liquid water colors. Use a small bowl for each color, or put a different color in each compartment of an ice cube tray!Spread out old towels or a vinyl tablecloth to protect the work surface.  Use paint brushes or eyedroppers to apply color to the paper towels. If you want more vivid color (and aren’t worried about cleanup), fold each paper towel (at least twice) into a square. Then dip each corner into a different color. Allow any excess water to drop back into the container.Don’t soak the paper towel too deeply or for very long or it will get overly saturated. The towels don’t have to be completely colored – some white areas will look great, too! This is a good time to explain color mixing while children observe and experiment.  Open each paper towel, if you had them folded. Spread out the towels on a sunny sidewalk or driveway, or nearby a fireplace (not too close!). Let them sit until they are totally dry to the touch.   You may want to flip them over once if they don’t seem to be drying completely. You can use a hairdryer to help the towels dry. If it’s a windy day, either dry the paper towels indoors or make sure to weigh the corners down.  Bunch the middle of the towel together. Wrap a twist tie or pipe cleaner around the middle and wrap it a couple of times. Fluff out the wings gently with your hands.   If you want the wings to have more definition, fold the paper towel accordion-style before bunching it together in the middle. Fold one outer edge to form a thin rectangle. Then flip the towel over and fold the rectangle back onto itself. Flip the towel again and repeat until it’s completely pleated.  If you wrapped pipe cleaner around the middle, simply bend or curl the ends to make the antennae. Otherwise, you can make them out of bendy straws! Attach two straws to the middle of each butterfly, and secure them with tape or hot glue., Add stickers for eyes, such as googly eye stickers! Use your imagination and add whatever decorations you like – for example, buttons, puff balls, or colorful stickers. Attach your decorations with hot glue or a bit of double-sided tape.   Make sure to follow all instructions, age group recommendations and safety precautions when using hot glue. You can hang your butterflies from the ceiling with string, or pin them to a bulletin board.	Pour dye into separate containers. Dip or brush the paper towels to color them. Lay the towels out to dry. Secure each paper towel in the middle with a twist tie or pipe cleaner. Make antennae with straws or pipe cleaner. Decorate further, if desired.
Four of them should be a solid color and the last one should be "variegated yarn". "Variegated yarn" is simply yarn that is different colors. Choose colors that coordinate with one another.  Each square is approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) in length and width. Knit one square for each of the solid colors. Also knit an extra square with any solid yarn, and four squares with the variegated yarn.   Cast on 12 stitches.  Knit 12 rows.  Cast off Yarn from a Knitting Needle   , Place the variegated squares in the corners. In the middle of the square, put one of the solid colors that you knit twice., This step is optional and can only be done if you're using wool yarn. Felting makes your knitting softer and harder to differentiate the stitches. To felt, simply throw your work in the washer and put in a pair of jeans. The more friction the better!, You can simply cut out a flower from felt. Also, it doesn't have to be a flower. It can be a felt star, circle, or whatever matches the theme of the room you'll be putting the pillow in.,, Make sure not to sew the top of your pillow, so you can fill it with stuffing., You can use anything soft you find at the crafts store.,, Do this if you have extra yarn left. Just cut out a piece of yarn and fold several pieces of yarn over it. Tie another yarn around the folded yarn. Secure tassel to your pillow.	Buy 5 balls of yarn. Knit nine squares. Sew the nine squares together so that they make one big square. Felt the square. Sew on a felt flower on top of the middle square.Punch holes in the edges of your foam square with a hole puncher. Using a yarn needle sew the yarn square to the foam square, weaving in and out of the holes. Stuff your pillow.Sew your pillow up for good. Add tassles.
; ,, The motor should have exposed metal which wired can be soldered on to. Ask your hobby store to give you a motor that can be soldered and modified.  Be sure that the metal tip of the wire touches the metal on the motor.  Again, be sure that the metal tip from the wire touches the metal of the motor. , The switch in the picture above is a SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) switch. A non-momentary switch is any switch that doesn't require a constant hold on the switch for electricity to pass through. This means that you can press the switch once and electricity will pass through until you press it again to turn it off.   Again, be sure that the metal tip of the wire is attached to one of the metal prongs on the switch. , Solder the positive (red) tip of the wire to the positive lead of the battery and the negative (black) tip of the wire to the negative lead of the battery.  Be sure the metal tip is touching the center metal prong of the switch before you solder.   This will let the electricity flow from the battery through the switch and then to the motor.  This completes the circuit and engages flow of electricity from the battery.   If there are no LEDs: Connect the positive ends of the battery holder and motor together, and do the same with the negative (-) ends. If there are LEDs: Directly connecting them to the battery would instantly kill them, so connect a 350ohm resistor to the positive end of the LED and connect the other end to the positive of the battery. ,	Get your supplies, listed below. Cut a hole in the tupperware box for the motor using a utility knife. , Acquire a motor like the one shown above from any hobby store. Solder one wire to the right side of the motor. Attach the other end of the wire to the left side of the battery. Glue your quarter, dime, or penny to the shaft of the motor with hot glue.  , Solder the positive(red) motor wire to any non-momentary switch. Glue the motor into the hole you cut for it, and glue anything else on that you want to.  , Using another set of wires, wire up a battery to your robot. Solder the positive (red) tip of the wire connected to the battery to the center pin of the switch. Solder the negative(black) tip of the wire from the battery with the negative tip of the wire from the motor. Glue the lid of the tupperware box to your small cardboard box, again using hot glue.  , Put the tupperware box on the lid, and the battery can be tucked inside the cardboard box and you're done!
You will need about 10 feet of 550 paracord, and another piece of paracord that you will use as your flatline. You will also need a paracord buckle, some scissors, and a lighter.; , Then take the center strings out of the flatline piece on paracord and feed it through the buckle 2 inches.  Then with the second piece of paracord, wrap it around the first, go behind the back, up through the hole made by the first, and pull it tight. Make sure you tuck the flatline tail piece into the back so you braid over it.  The take the second piece of paracord, wrap it over the first, behind the bracelet and up through the hole made by the first. and pull tight.  Remember to tuck in the other end of the flatline when you get down to the last 3 or 4 braids.	Gather you supplies. Attach the paracord to the buckle, and measure it on your wrist. Lay the piece of paracord you want to be the center color across the top, including over the flatline piece. Take the center color of paracord, lay it across the top, but under the flatline piece. Continue the same pattern weaving the flatline over under every knot, until you get to the end. Cut off the ends of the paracord as close to the bracelet as possible, and melt them with a lighter.
Most libraries have a mission statement that helps to identify their goals, acquisitions, funding, organization and more. Although this need not be a formal document, it is a good idea to clarify your goals before starting to build a personal library.; , Unlike city or school libraries that are at least partially publicly funded, a personal reference library relies on your own funds. If you have a small budget, you may want to look into acquiring used books, rather than new books.  Unless you have a very large budget from the outset, you should follow the general rules of all libraries and create an acquisition plan.   For example, if you have $100 per month, you may plan to acquire at least 3 new books per month, every month for 2 years. You will have 72 books after 2 years, if you follow this plan. If you plan to buy used books because you have a budget of $50, you may be able to find 4 books per month, resulting in 98 books in your reference library after 2 years.  Most reference libraries are somewhat defined by the personal interests of the people creating it. After plans are made to acquire the staples of a reference library, such as an encyclopedia and an atlas, you may want to start collecting based on your interests.   For example, possible specialized topics include biblical studies, natural science, psychology, music, travel or art.  This may be a room, or a large corner of a room, but it should be dedicated to the reference library, in order to preserve organization and provide a quiet study space. Include the following items in your library:   Find sturdy bookcases with adjustable shelves. Many reference books are larger and heavier than fiction books. You can hire someone to build in your bookcases, or you can buy freestanding bookcases at most furniture stores. If you have freestanding bookcases, make sure they are anchored to the walls. Add a computer and computer desk. An online database is the best way to catalog your books. An online research center is also a necessary part of any reference library. The computer desk should be set up with a chair. Make room for a library table. These tables are long and flat, so that you can lay out more than 1 book at a time when you are doing research. The table should be large enough so you can lay out large atlases, with room to spare for a notebook. Find a comfortable reading chair, if you plan to do extensive reading in your library. Many people prefer to have a well-upholstered chair where they feel comfortable sitting for a couple of hours. Add incandescent lighting to limit eyestrain. Your room should have task lighting above work stations and the reading chair, so that you can see your pen, paper and book pages. Task lighting can be provided by pendant lamps or standing lamps. It should also include ambient lighting that fills the room with enough light to see the book spines on the shelves. This is usually provided by overhead lights or fixtures near the ceiling. Choose ambient lighting that is separate from task lighting. It is not a good idea to place lighting directly on the books themselves for long periods of time. Over time the books will be damaged by harsh lighting or sunlight. Turn off the ambient lighting when you have collected your books and you are under your task lighting. Buy a library ladder or stool, if you have tall, custom built shelves. This will help to avoid falls and allow you to access your entire library.	Clarify your personal mission statement. Develop a reasonable monthly or yearly budget. Develop a time line to acquire books. Determine a specialization. Create a library environment that is spacious enough to hold books, computers and a study area.
This is the backing portion of the brooch.  Keep the shape simple. You can trace around a cookie cutter pig shape or find a simple pig shape online to trace around.  The paper can be colored (such as pink or rusty brown) or you can use white paper and color it in any design wished., Take care to line up the paper and cardboard pieces evenly., Once dried, add any features, such as eyes and a smile. Two small felt triangles can be glue on for ears (optional).  Add a ribbon bow. Glue on or tie around the pig's neck. Stick on artificial jewels for a bit of fun.  This seals in the paper and helps to to be stronger., Allow to dry completely., The brooch is now ready to be worn.	Draw the shape of a pig on a piece of cardboard. Draw the same shape on a thick piece of paper. Glue the piece of paper shaped like a pig onto the cardboard piece. Allow to dry. Paint Mod Podge or a thin layer of clear craft glue over the top. Glue a brooch pin on the back of the pig. Done.
Boysenberries enjoy mild winters and warm summers.; , Add a lot of well-rotted manure to the ground before planting.  The best method for growing boysenberries is to place a two-wire trellis system in the planting area. Erect this prior to planting.   Tie the fruiting canes to the top wire of the two-wire trellis. Use the second wire to train new growth that will fruit in the following year. , The main difference is that boysenberries require a lot more vigorous pruning to prevent their growth from getting out of hand.  A well tended boysenberry plant should produce fruit well for up to 15 years. Expect about 5kg of fruit each season from each plant.   Cut back the top growing canes (the ones attached to the top wire) at the end of the harvest. Cut them down to ground level. In turn, transfer the new growth canes to the top wire level in readiness for next season.  Boysenberries can be made into ice cream, baked in cakes, pies, and crumbles, or enjoyed fresh on their own or with a dollop of cream or ice cream.	Ensure that you have a suitable climate. Prepare the soil. Prepare a trellis system. Space boysenberry plants 2 meters (6.6 ft) apart.  , Use the same methods for growing boysenberries as for growing raspberries. Harvest the boysenberries when ready. Enjoy the harvest.
You'll need a wooden frame that can fit around the mirror and ribbon that's slightly wider than that frame. Cut out a paper template of one side of the frame, including the mitered corners. Paint the frame's inner and outer edges to a color that's similar to the ribbon's. Cut the ribbon slightly longer than the paper template. Iron on strips of fusing to the back of each piece of ribbon. Use a pencil to trace the template onto the fusing. Cut the shape out of the ribbon. Repeat with three other pieces. Press each ribbon piece, fusing side down, onto the frame. Place a towel over the ribbon and iron on a low setting to adhere.  Repurpose an antique platter or plate by using its border as a decorative frame for a mirror. If the platter is broken, use ceramic epoxy to glue the pieces together. Measure the perimeter of the platter's central well. Draw the measured shape on a piece of paper; then cut out the shape to make a template. Find a mirror that matches the template shape, or get a professional glass cutter to cut a mirror to the measurements of your template. Create a braided trim by gluing pillow piping around the perimeter of the mirror. Use ceramic epoxy to glue the mirror to the center of the platter. For a more temporary adhesive, use mounting tape. Hang the platter mirror with a plate hanger.  Use stencil patterns to decorate your mirror. Find a stencil pattern that you like on paper. Trace the pattern onto a piece adhesive shelf liner. Cut the pattern out of the adhesive liner with a utility knife. Peel the border of the liner back and adhere it onto the mirror. Use a bristle brush to apply enamel paint over the stencil. Let the paint dry overnight, and then strip it off.  Use a hot glue gun to attach a border of them around your mirror.	Create a decorative frame with ribbon. Use a platter for a frame. Embellish the mirror with a stenciled overlay frame. Create a frame out of stones or shells.
It needs to be sheltered, and have some shade during the day. Somewhere near the herb garden or veggie patch is ideal, especially if it's easy to reach from your kitchen.;	Select a large space in your garden.
Make sure that they are clean. If they are dirty, wash them using soap and warm water. Pat them dry with a paper towel.; , The best surface to work on would be a slab of wood or an old cutting board you won't mind poking holes in. The underside of the bottle cap should be facing up. You will be punching the hole from the inside.  Place a small, thin nail against the top of the bottle cap. Hit the top of the nail with a hammer. Try to get the hole as close to the side edge as possible.   Make sure that you are punching the hole near the top of the bottle cap design.  Take hold the jump ring with a pair of jewelry pliers, making sure that the seam is facing upwards. Pinch the other side of the jump ring with your fingers or another pair of pliers. Twist the jump ring towards you. Do not pull the jump ring apart, or it won't close evenly again.  Don't close the ring just yet.  Use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Even though you are working on one earring at a time, it might be a good idea to cut the chain for your other earring at this time as well. This way, you can be sure that they are perfectly even.   To make basic earrings without a chain, omit this step. Click here to continue.  Grab the jump ring again with your jewelry pliers. Make sure that the seam is facing upwards again. Pinch the other part of the jump ring with your fingers or another pair of pliers. The bottle cap and chain should be hanging from the jump ring. Carefully pull the two ends towards each other to flatten and close them.  Pull open a new jump ring as before, and slip it onto the top of the chain. Don't close the jump ring just yet.  Use the same twisting motion as you did on the first jump ring.  When you are done, you can wear the earrings, sell them, or give them away as a gift.	Find two matching bottle caps. Place the bottle cap down on a sturdy surface. Punch a hole into the bottle cap. Twist open a jump ring. Slip the jump ring through the hole you made earlier. Cut a 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) long piece of delicate chain. Slip one end of the chain onto the jump ring, and twist the ring close. Attach another jump ring to the top of each chain. Slip an earring hook onto the jump ring and twist it close. Repeat the whole process of the other earring.
While you might usually tailgate vehicles ahead of you when they’re going slowly, this is very dangerous on icy roads. Stay at least 8 seconds behind the vehicle ahead of you. If you’re not used to winter driving, stay 10 seconds behind.  To measure your following distance, pick a fixed point ahead of the vehicle you’re following. Street signs work best for this. Keep an eye on the car ahead, and start counting once its nose crosses the fixed point you chose. Count until the nose of your car crosses this same point. If you’re in the 8-10 range, you’ll know you’re maintaining a safe distance. Not all icy conditions need the same stopping distance. At 0° Fahrenheit (-18° Celsius), you need twice as much stopping distance as you would at 32° Fahrenheit (0° Celsius).; , If you’re in an area that sees a lot of snow and ice, having winter tires on your vehicle will make driving less dangerous. They’re specifically designed to help your car maintain traction in winter conditions; the grooves are typically deeper and angled diagonally.  If you live in a warmer climate, but you’re concerned about icy roads, you should at least get all-season tires., You could have the best winter tires on the market, but you still need to use caution. If you’re driving on icy roads, you shouldn’t go any faster than 45 mph (72 kmh), even on the highway. Driving more slowly gives you more time to react, giving you more distance to immobilize your vehicle., This is especially important if you live in an area where roads don’t usually get icy, but applies even if you’ve seen your share of difficult winters. The best way to deal with an emergency situation is to avoid it altogether. Usually your local authorities will warn you not to go on the roads when it’s too dangerous to do so. Listen to their instructions unless it’s absolutely necessary for you to be driving.	Keep a safe distance from other cars. Purchase the right tires. Slow down. Avoid driving altogether.
Start by making a simple chain. You can make the chain as long or as short as you want it to be. Just keep in mind that this will serve as the backdrop for your motifs, so make sure to make it large enough to sew all of them onto.For example, you could make a small backdrop by chaining 40, or make a large backdrop by chaining 150. It’s up to you and what you need to complete your design.  To begin your first row, single crochet into the tenth chain from the hook. This will make a small chain loop., Next, chain six stitches, skip three chains and then single crochet into the base chain. This will create another chain loop. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row., When you get to the end of your row, make a chain of nine for your turning chain. This will help to provide slack to work the next row and it will also serve as your first chain loop., Start your new row with a single crochet stitch into the next loop in your row. Then, chain six stitches. Then, skip three and single crochet to connect the stitches. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row. Follow the last chain of six with a single crochet stitch. Chain nine and turn your work again and then repeat the second row until your backdrop is the length you want it to be.  When you have finished several motifs and your background is complete, thread a needle with the same color thread as your yarn and then begin sewing your motifs onto the background. You can place them however you like.  You may want to start by pinning them on to see how you would like to arrange them, and then sew them in place when you are happy with the arrangement.	Make a chain that is as long as you want your backdrop to be. Single crochet into the tenth chain from the hook. Chain six, skip three, and single crochet. Finish the first row with a chain of nine, and turn. Work a single crochet into the next loop, chain six, and skip three. Sew your motifs onto your background.
How long the ribbon is depends on how big you want the bow to be. The wider the ribbon is, the more ribbon you will need to cut. This method will create something that looks like the standard bow you'd use to tie shoe laces with., Find the center of your length of ribbon first, then make a loop to each side of that point. Make sure that both loops are pointing upward., Gently tug on the loops to tighten the knot. This is just like when you are tying your shoes., Pull the loops or tails one at a time until you get the length you want them to be. Stop when the loops are the right length for you, then tug on them both at the same time to tighten the knot. Don't worry if the tails are too long., If you have a very wide ribbon, the knot in the middle may be wrinkled. Slip your forefingers under each side of the knot on the front of the ribbon. Straighten out the side edges of the knot., Use your fingers to fluff up the loops to you liking. The wires inside the ribbons will help the loops keep their shape. If you need to, use a pair of scissors to trim the ribbon tails down.You can cut the tail ends at angles or into notches.	Cut a length of ribbon. Make two loops in your ribbon. Cross the loops over and under each other. Gently adjust the length of the tails and the loops. Straighten the knot, if needed. Shape the ribbons and trim the tails.
Cut out four bunny ear shapes. These will form the arms. Sew two pieces together using a machine or a basic stitch of your choice to form each one of the arms. Leave a slit at the end open for stuffing.  Repeat the previous step bit with slightly larger shapes to make the legs. You can adjust the shape of the leg to get your bear to look or sit differently.  Draw a profile (side-view) of the head that you want for your bear. Cut out two pieces in this shape. Next, stitch them together from the neck up to the nose.  Cut the gusset, or middle piece, to go between the two head pieces you already cut and sewed. Draw out a shape like a men's tie and make it long enough to reach between the point of the nose, all the way around to the back of the neck. You will need to line it up at the neck and pin it in place before sewing.  Once you've drawn and cut out the shape, sew the gusset into place between the existing head pieces.  Now you'll need to make the body pieces. Start with two pieces of fabric cut into rectangles. Now, make rounded cutouts at each of the corners. Sew the sides together, along the long edges, so that you end up with a sort of tube. Now, sew one of the short edges closed, leaving the circle cutouts open. The arms and legs will be joined to the body at the circles.  Using a pencil can help. Turning the pieces hides the seams you made.  Pre-stuff the head and sew it to the top of the body piece, at the open, short end.          Some stuffing may leak out into the body. That's okay.  Now, sew on both of the arms at the upper circular cutouts. Attach one of the legs in a similar way, but leave the last leg off. Stuff the bear with filling and then sew on the last leg.  Cut ears out, making a shape like a half circle. Fold the shape in half and then attach the ears to the head.  Add facial details (like a nose and mouth) with embroidery floss or buttons.  Now you can sew on his eyes. Use buttons if you want to or buy stuffed animal eyes from your local craft store.          Embroidered eyes are better for smaller kids who tend to put every thing in their mouth.  Have fun taking care of your new stuffed animal or give him to someone you love as a gift.	Make the arms. Make the legs. Draw out and made the profile of the head. Cut the gusset for the head. Sew the gusset in place. Make the body piece. Turn all of the pieces inside out. Stuff and attach the head. Attach the arms and legs. Cut and attach some ears. Give your bear a face. Sew on button eyes. Enjoy your new stuffed animal!
They typically feature exotic locations where the protagonist has been stranded or has traveled to. These said exotic locations are usually islands, jungles, or some kind of frozen wasteland.

Lay the shirt completely flat with the front of the shirt facing upward. Secure the sleeves, neck area and bottom of the shirt to the paper using sewing pins. This will keep the shirt nice and flat while you paint.; , You will want to outline from the base of the neck down to the middle of the shirt, creating an oval shape.Paint the inside the oval area using white fabric paint and a wide paint brush and This will give the appearance of Jack Skellington’s white shirt underneath the jacket. You may also cut along the outline of the initial oval area using fabric shears, then simply wear a white t-shirt underneath your costume for the same effect.  At this point you should have the appearance of a white shirt with jacket lapels on each side. This should look like an inner ‘U’ shape and an outer ‘U’ shape that both meet in the middle of the shirt., Using a small paintbrush white fabric paint, start at the ends of the shoulders and paint 6-8 straight, vertical lines all the way down to the bottom of each sleeve.   Use a ruler to keep your lines straight while painting. Paint horizontal lines on the lapel from the tops of the shoulders down to the center of the jacket using a small paintbrush, the lines should be drawn about ½ of an inch apart.  The lines should run down to the bottom of the shirt starting from the left underarm. With the white fabric paint, use a small paintbrush and a ruler to keep the lines straight. These lines should also be approximately ½ inch apart.   As you move toward the center of the shirt, be sure to start painting your pinstripes from the outer edge of the lapel down to the bottom of the shirt. Repeat the same instructions for the right side, painting approximately 8 lines per side.  Use your small paintbrush and white fabric paint to from the left side of the shirt to the right.   In the center of the jacket, directly underneath bottom of the lapel, use your white fabric paint to draw a small, circle about the size of a 50 cent piece to replicate the button on Jack’s tuxedo jacket.Set aside to allow all paint to dry.  Use sewing pins to clip the waist area and very bottom of the pants to the paper to ensure that the pants remain flat and secure while painting.Paint small, vertical lines that run from the left hip area down to the bottom of the left leg. Use a ruler to keep your lines straight and keep them approximately 1 inch apart. In the center of the pants, be sure to paint the lines from the top of the waistband to the bottom of the crotch area. Allow the paint to dry and repeat these instructions on the backside. In the end, the pants should have approximately 8 lines per leg on the front and back.  The bat’s head should be approximately 3 inches wide with winged tipped ears. You can use the construction paper itself as the bat’s head, or black felt by using what you’ve drawn as a stencil and cutting around it.Outline both eyes with the white colored pencil and then fill them in with either the pencil, or with whiteout.  Each wingtip should extend approximately 8 inches outward with pointy ends. Wings should extend approximately 2-3 inches past each shoulder.   Cut around the outline to create the wings. You can use these construction paper wings or create more life-like wings by using black felt.You can use your outline as a stencil to cut the felt into wings. Use white paint or whiteout to draw small horizontal lines within each wingtip. There are no set amount of lines to draw, but shoot for a minimum of 2-3 lines starting at the tip of each wing down to the center.  You can use one pin on either side of the bat’s face, or place one at the top of its head and another at the bottom.   The wings should be left unpinned and should be sticking straight out about 2-3 inches past the shoulders. Pinning the bow tie may be best accomplished once you have already put on the suit.  Using black liquid eyeliner or a black eyeliner pencil, the outline should start underneath the eyebrows and continue underneath the eyes, stopping before you reach the bridge of the nose to recreate Jack Skellington’s black, sunken eyes.Apply black makeup underneath the eyebrows, completely over the eyelids and underneath the eyes., Use black liquid eyeliner or black lipstick to create a straight line that extends from the bottom of the ear to the corner of the mouth. Apply the liquid eyeliner or lipstick to draw stitches vertically across the horizontal line, then repeat on the right side of the face to recreate Jack Skellington’s stitched mouth.Color your lips using black lipstick, then create the same stitch effect from right above the upper lip to right below the bottom lip.  Include the ears the base of the skull and the front and back of the neck. While adding makeup to the ears, be sure not to get powder inside of the ear canal.   Be sure to dab both around and inside the stitches so that they remain visible., The cap should fit snug and tight with few wrinkles.

Draw a ½ inch thick line across the left cheek. Cover face and skin with white powder makeup. Wear a plain white or flesh colored latex cap to replicate the bald white skull.
Sort of like a bowling ball, the coconut will have three "eyes." They're really just spots on one end. Two will be side-by-side, and one will be the odd one out – it's this odd one that is the soft spot, which you can tap into to drain.   Sometimes you'll need to remove strands from the husk to really get at the eyes. This is easy enough to do with your hands or a small knife. The area around the eye should be clean.; , If your knife is small enough, you may be able just to poke right through the eye, through the meat, and into the liquid with your knife. If not, find a screwdriver or a drill bit that is small enough to force an opening.   You may need to tap the end of the screwdriver or drill bit with a hammer. Just a few light taps ought to do it.       If you experience a hissing sound once you break through to the meat, that's good – it means the coconut is depressurizing. If you don't (or if you experience air going out instead of in, it's possible your coconut has gone bad.  Coconut water is delicious, so save it! However, make sure it's good before you combine it with other coconut water – you don't want to tarnish the whole batch. Here's how to know if it's good:   It should be fairly clear, almost like water. There should be no clouds. It should not be slimy.  Every coconut has a natural "center point" that is marked by a thin line, sort of like an equator. This is where it will be easiest to break the coconut cleanly in half. Locate this line before you begin tapping.   To hold the coconut properly, hold it in your non-dominant hand. The eyes should be facing down and the ends should be facing out to the sides.  Never use the sharp blade of a knife to hit a coconut! Not only could you hurt yourself, but this could force the coconut to break in a dozen pieces. Using the blunt, back side of a heavy blade to slowly break it cleanly in half.   A meat cleaver is great as there is a natural curve to the back side of the blade. This matches the curve of the coconut, applying pressure evenly. Again, the 3 eyes of the coconut should be facing away from your hand.  Crack the knife against the line a second time. Keep making slight rotations, always rapping against the line. Keep going in this manner until you hear a cracking sound. Once it starts cracking, use less and less force to keep it in two large pieces.   For some coconuts, this will take a few smacks. For others, it will take a few full rotations. You're not doing anything wrong – some coconuts are simply easier to split than others.       Keep rapping and turning until the crack has gone all the way around the coconut and it splits cleanly apart.  The easiest way to pry the meat away from the shell is first break the shell in pieces with hammer or something hard, then take a steel glass , position it between the meat and the shell and scoop out the meat easily within seconds. Another approach is to grab a spoon and position it between the meat and the shell with the back of the spoon facing the shell. The meat will come off in chunks as it breaks loose. You may not be able to get all the meat out (coconuts can be finicky), which is when the next step comes in handy.   Spoon not working too great? Some coconut meat is more difficult than others. In this case, grab a small paring-like knife to shred at the meat. Make a cut into the meat and drive the knife along the edge, much like you would peel an orange.       Before you toss the coconut meat, consider keeping it. It's delicious, especially when cold or turned into a smoothie!        , The amount of time you need depends on the size of the coconut and the thickness of the meat. Once it's finished, the meat will have shrunk and you'll be able to pull out the meat in one piece.   People in the Micronesian islands of Palau, Ponape, Chuuk, the Caroline's, etc., will lay coconut halves face up in the sunshine for a number of days till the meat separates from the shell.  Give them a few days (or up to a week) to fully dry and harden. Giving them this extra drying-out period will make them easier to use for crafts or as a cup or bowl.   They make great decorations in the interim! And if there's even a shred of meat left, it will shrink up and dry during this time period, too.	Find the eyes of the coconut. Poke into the eye with a knife, a drill bit, or a screwdriver. Drain the water into a bowl, jar or cup. Locate the thin line along the middle of the coconut. Smack the coconut against the line with the back side of a large knife or meat cleaver. Rotate the coconut about a quarter of a turn with each rap. Pry the meat away from the shell. Place the 2 coconut halves on a cookie sheet in the oven at 150°C (300°F) for 1-2 hours. Place the coconuts shell-side down in a well-ventilated area.
; , Hold your left hand in the air as if you are ready to play the instrument.  Try to move your wrist and your arm so that your hand touches the imaginary pencil. Keep in mind that, while you vibrate, the only thing you should be trying to move is your wrist (in a back and forth motion), as if there were two pencils on either side and you were trying to brush them as your hand moves. This is the movement you shall use for vibrato. While doing this movement, your left hand should remain extremely calm.  First you should try the vibrato movement without actually playing, and you should attempt to do it slowly. Vibrato works best when only one finger is on the string. You may try vibrato with any finger you would like, although it is usually easier to do on the 2nd and 3rd fingers. Do not attempt vibrato on the 4th finger until you have mastered it on the rest of the fingers, however.  It rolls against the fingerboard, rather than slipping back and forth. Again, keep in mind that your wrist should be moving, and not your arm. You should also not have to put effort into rolling your finger against the string. Because your wrist is in the vibrato motion, your finger should roll on its own.  You will hear the pitch lowering. That is because, as you vibrate, your finger should first be on the correct pitch, and then roll towards the scroll, which will lower the pitch. After that, your finger should roll back towards the previous pitch. This is what causes the shaky sound in vibrato.  Your finger should roll against the string so slowly that you can hear the lowering of pitch. And then, after that, the raising of pitch.  Learning vibrato may take a lot of time, but it is very much worth it.	Begin practicing vibrato only after you are fairly comfortable with your finger placement and have memorized all of your notes' positions. Understand how your wrist is supposed to move as you vibrato. As you hold your left hand in this fashion, imagine that someone is holding a pencil just centimeters away from the side of your hand. Try it with your instrument. Keep in mind that your finger should never slide on the string. Try bowing the string that your vibrating finger is on. Move very slowly when learning, to develop muscle memory. Practice this slowly until you feel very comfortable.
Based on the number of pages you’ll need, divide out the book's pages and bind with paper or binder clips.   Make sure you clump an even number of pages together throughout the book. To ensure evenness, clip on both the bottom and the top of the pages (and on the side if necessary).  If the pages won't smooth, you can try lightly misting them with water and close book for several hours if pages.  Place a drop or two of glue along the perimeter of each page and hold together until each bound page division is held together.   Press down carefully with your hand to ensure the pages are bound together and smooth over the front and back page.	Bind the pages together. Smooth out any wrinkles from pages. Glue the pages together using the hot glue gun. Repeat the process until you have the desired number of pages for your earring storage book.
Herbicides can be used to chemically control or kill weeds in your garden or lawn, but are typically species specific to the weeds that you have.Before purchasing a herbicide, refer to online encyclopedias to identify the type of weeds that you have.   Applying a chemical solution to your garden should be the last resort as it can pollute groundwater and can be bad for the environment.Weeds can be broken up into three classifications known as broad-leaves, grasses, and sedges and their life cycle can be annual, biennial, or perennial., Before applying herbicide to any weeds in your garden, it’s important that you read the directions and the label on the box it came with.Some herbicides may pose a threat to other plants, so make sure to read the warnings before applying anything in your garden or lawn. You should also determine if the herbicide is made for weed prevention, or for killing weeds once they are grown.  Wearing things like an apron, rubber gloves, protective eye-wear, and a face-mask will protect you from any herbicides that may inadvertently get on you.   Tyvek and nitrile gloves are the best material to use when handling herbicide and can be bought in hardware stores or online., Do not douse an area with herbicide, even if it has a lot of weeds, as this could be dangerous. Use the recommended level of herbicide according to the label.   You can visit a local cooperative extension if you have additional questions about applying herbicide to your garden or lawn, or having trouble choosing the correct chemical for the types of weeds that you have.	Identify the weeds that you have. Read and follow the directions on the label of the herbicide. Wear protective gear before applying the chemicals. Spray the herbicide to weeds and weed prone areas.
Check to see how many openings there are and how far apart they are. You may have to look underneath to be sure. For bathroom faucets, in particular, the two handles may be joined with the spout to become a single unit or they may be spread apart from it. You will need this information to choose the correct replacement.; , You'll probably be using this faucet for a long time, so it's worth investing in a good-quality faucet.   It's possible to spend anywhere from about $20 to $500 and above on a faucet. Read reviews and decide for yourself how much of what you are paying is for quality and how much is for designer names/styling and fancy features.  They can range from detailed and helpful to minimal and frustrating. When in doubt, defer to the manufacturer's instructions rather than those you find elsewhere.  It's a tool designed to reach way up behind your sink and remove the two big nuts on each side of the faucet that hold the faucet tight against the sink. If you can't loosen the nuts by hand or with the tools you have on hand, a basin wrench will make the job easier. , Arrange any portable lamp or use a drop light if you have one.  Under the sink, you will see two supply lines coming out of the wall and going up to your faucet. There should be a valve on each one, one for hot and one for cold. Turn both of these valves off by twisting them clockwise as though they were faucets.  Water will come out of each tube now as they drain back from the faucet so you'll need a towel to soak up this water.   It's a good idea to replace the supply lines when you replace the faucet, if they are old, especially if they were the flexible sort. If you have solid tubing, it isn't generally necessary unless it doesn't reach the new faucet. If you're not replacing the supply lines, you may only have to disconnect them at the top. A braided, stainless steel reinforced supply line will virtually eliminate the possibility of flooding from the line bursting.  This is where you'll want to use a basin wrench if you have one. You may have one, two, or even three nuts. Your sink may look different because they may be hard plastic, brass, or silver-colored metal. This may be the hardest part of the job, since the threads are often quite long and they may be corroded so that the nuts are difficult to turn. Hang in there! It gets easier from here. , If they are damaged in any way, take one with you to the store where you bought the wrench and buy two, new, gray plastic tubes the same length. They come with new nuts and end fittings.  You may have to scrape and scour to remove hard water deposits, although depending on the new faucet, some of the area may be covered. Try vinegar or an acid cleaner to help dissolve hard water deposits.  You need something like this to seal around the base to keep water from getting under it. If not, buy some plumbers' putty. It's gray in color and is something like chewing gum. Stick a bead of it around the base before you mount the new faucet. When you tighten down those two big nuts, it will squeeze a little of this putty out but it's easy to clean up with rubbing alcohol. , Sometimes there is a separate flange or plate that slips over the bottom. If you want this flange installed, or if there are any additional hoses to assemble, do so now. ,,,, Wait for ten minutes and check for leaks again. If everything seems fine, you're done; if not, tighten the fittings a little more and check for leaks again.	Inspect your sink. Obtain a replacement faucet. Review the instructions that come with the faucet. Consider buying a basin wrench for under $20. Remove everything from under the sink and store it well out of your way.  , Get plenty of light under your sink so you can see what you are doing up there. Turn off the water to the faucet. Loosen the tube nut that's just above the valve on each tube and lift the tubes out of the valves. Remove the large nuts that hold the faucet in place. Lift the old faucet up, tubes and all, right out of the sink.  , Now, examine the tubes carefully. Before installing your new faucet, give the sink a good cleaning where the old faucet was mounted. Check your new faucet base and see if they include a soft plastic gasket. Attach the new tubes to the new faucet before you install it in the sink.  , Assemble the new faucet. Slip the new faucet through the hole(s) in the sink.  , Tighten the new nut(s) from below the sink, but stop when you get close.  , Before you get those two big nuts tight, take a look at your new faucet, see if it is straight or angled one way or the other, then finish tightening up the nuts.  , Insert the tubes into the valves under the sink and tighten up the tube nuts.  , Turn on the water and check for any leak.
You may not be able to kill large infestations simply by crushing them, but killing one or two sends off a chemical signal that may warn other aphids to stay away.; , If only one section of the plant is infected, snip it off with garden shears and drop it into a plastic bag or bucket of soapy water.  Both bugs are natural predators of aphids and can help tame your aphid population. Purchase a ladybug house and commercial ladybug food to lure ladybugs to your garden, or purchase ladybugs from vendors or nurseries. Lacewings can also be lured with the same food or purchased from the save vendors.  Chickadees and wrens are both especially useful in reducing the aphid population. Put up birdhouses and spread birdseed in your backyard.  Ants actually protect aphid colonies. Lure them away by placing small containers of honey below an aphid-infested plant. The honey should draw the ants away, exposing the aphids to more natural predators.  Sticky bands and other ant traps destroy the ants that protect aphids instead of merely drawing them away.  Mint, fennel, dill, yarrow, clover, and dandelions are known to attract lacewings, ladybugs, and a type of insect actually called the "aphid predator." Placing these plants around the plants you wish to protect may draw predators capable of controlling the aphid population.  Garlic and onion plants are the most effective. The potent smell typically drives away most colonies of aphids.  Grow plants that attract aphids, like asters, cosmos, larkspur, dahlias, and zinnias, but plant them away from the plants you want to protect. The aphids will be drawn to these plants and will stay away from less appetizing plants as a result.  They find aphids great meals for them. Purchase a praying mantis or a praying mantis habitat.	Use your fingers or a pair of garden shears to kill aphids. Snip off the infected section. Invite ladybugs and lacewings to your garden for dinner. Attract more birds to your house. Lure ants away from the scene. Control the ant population by placing sticky bands around trees and infected plants. Attract aphid predators with the right plants. Grow plants that drive aphids away. Compromise with the enemy. Attract a praying mantis.
People sometimes spend hours browsing through their phones. Send your friends a few text messages asking how they're doing. Change the settings or ringtone on your phone. Browse your social media accounts and read the latest news. Dive into your phone and see what you can dig up.   Call someone up if you feel like talking! Spending time on the phone isn't a fun activity in of itself, but it's a useful way of staying connected to other people, and you'll usually find enough interesting things to do to keep you occupied indefinitely.; , The internet is notorious to eating up people's time. If you have a few hours you want to see disappear quickly, going on the internet and browsing can be incredibly rewarding if done correctly. Depending on your personality and the mood you're in, there are many different activities that can be recommended to pass the time online:   Wikipedia is very easy to lose countless hours in. Try finding an article you're interested in, then give it a read. Once you're done with that, click one of the related articles that looks appealing and give that a read too. Before long you'll be too invested in learning about a variety of different things that you won't even be looking at the time. If you're the studious sort, taking active notes can help the knowledge sink in more permanently. Social media like Facebook and Twitter is seen as the number one potential timewaster of the 21st century. It's easy to get obsessed with getting 'likes' and 'retweets' that some people give up a large proportion of their time interacting online. Although it's usually something you should keep in moderation, you may find browsing Facebook is a great way to pass time if you don't have anything pressing to do.Streaming media sites like YouTube and Bandcamp are available if you're wanting to check out new videos or music. YouTube in particular comes with a vibrant community and content for virtually any topic you can think of. Try searching up something you're interested in, or explore something fresh altogether.  Watching a movie allows you to get lost in another world, if only for a little while. For the sake of making time go by faster however, television shows should be a go-to pastime. Look out for a show that people like to 'binge watch'. The best TV shows to pass time with tend to be serialized programs that tell a single story. This way, you don't use the episodic format as a way of remembering the time as much.   Long-form dramas like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad tend to reward those who watch multiple episodes in a row.Making sure you have somewhere quiet and comfy to watch your show is important as well. If everything around you is loud and hectic, you'll have a harder time really losing yourself in the show. Streaming video services like Hulu and Netflix are great for this, as they have many films and shows already available for you to check out., Video games are potentially an even better way to make the time pass by than films or shows, due to the fact that you are taking an active role in the experience of the media. Whether you need to kill a little or a lot of time, sitting down and engaging yourself with a video game can be a remarkably enjoyable and rewarding experience.   For the sake of passing time, high-intensity games like racing games and first-person shooters are recommended, although people tend to report the most time spent on role-playing and open-world games., The truth is that you can find a ton of engaging stuff to do outside as well. Going outside doesn't necessarily mean you need to be doing athletic activities either, unless that's your thing. There are a number of great places you might start your outdoor adventure:   Explore your home city. Go outside, take a bus somewhere and explore part of town you've never been. You never know what kind of stuff you may come across. Go for a walk. There are few things so simple and rewarding as going for a walk. Regardless of the weather, taking a stroll and listening to some of your favourite music can feel great. The vitamin D you'll be getting from the sunlight will also brighten your mood automatically, in case you're feeling blue. Pick up a sport. Sports like soccer, hockey or tennis make for a great workout, and can be great fun if you've got people to play with. Call up a friend and ask if they'd like to play a game with you. For future reference, you may want to join a local team. It's a good way to make new friends, and the exercise will leave you with better health and a brighter mood.	Check your phone.Usually the habits people dismiss as time-wasters will be your best friend if you're trying to make time pass by quickly. Surf the internet. Watch a film or television show. Play a video game. Go outside.Let's be serious; many of the things we'll usually think of when it comes to burning time are indoor and electronics-based.
Probably the simplest way to bring color into your garden is to take an old window frame and glue colored glass beads to it.   You should use glue such as E6000, which dries clear.       This can be displayed by standing it upright in a bed so that the sunlight comes through it.       Try anchoring it into the ground by attaching wooden stakes to the lower sides that can be driven at least 2 feet (0.6 m) into the ground for stability.       Silver or blue-tinted beads work well for giving the effect of bubbles.  The joy of old window art is bringing lots of translucent color into your garden.   You can try to source an old window with colored glass in – or create your own. Add a colorful mosaic to an old colorless glass window by gluing on a pattern of glass beads, transparent colored mosaic tiles or even sea glass gathered from the beach.       You can source colored glass receptacles, such as kitchenware, from thrift stores and smash these up to make glass shards. You’ll need to get some glass glue and a grout – try following an online glass mosaic tutorial. Home Depot can source a grout that works well – ask for 100% solids epoxy grout when ordering ahead.  It can be fun to paint your own works of art onto blank windows.  Not all glass paint will survive out of doors and some will peel, so choose your paint carefully.       You may find it helps to wipe down the glass surface using alcohol before you paint.       Paints such as the Martha Stewart Glass range are said to be outdoor resistant.       Also try sealing using Polycrylic for added protection.       As some paints need to be baked in the oven to seal the paints, you can either try removing the glass pane from the window to do so, or alternately paint a separate bit of glass and simply glue this onto your old window pane.  Creating a mini greenhouse can be a great place to store plants in a colorful way.   You’ll need 6 small window frames of the same size and shape for this.       Make them safe by removing protruding nails and resealing the windows where needed.       Using hinges or small wooden blocks, attach 4 of the smaller windows to each other at right angles. This forms the 4 sides of your mini greenhouse.       Then use hinges to add a peaked roof using the last 2 windows.       Put some plants inside to finish it off. Remember, it will get pretty hot inside so choose plants that like heat and keep them well watered.  Remember, you don’t need to have glass in the frames of your old windows to use them in the garden.   In fact, empty panes will make a great place for birds to perch.       Try painting old window frames using distressed paint techniques.       Outdoor chalk paint also works well.       Hang these on chains on the edge of your porch, from a tree branch, or on a barn door.       A collection of frames painted different colors works well.  An old window can be hung on a fence to create the illusion of a real window.   This works especially well if you replace the glass panes with mirror panels.       It also helps create a sense of space in a small garden.       You can make a nice effect if you use a window with shutters.       Try painting these in a color that complements your fence.       Try some paint distressing techniques to create an aged effect.  You can use an old window as a planting display by adding a window box or ledge to your window and putting a planter in it or several plant pots on it.   Another nice effect can be achieved by taking some old metal food cans, making some drainage holes at the bottom using a screwdriver, painting them in bright colors and patterns, and nailing them to the window frame before planting in them. This is a nice way to display plants against a colorful window frame.  Take an old window (or picture) frame that is empty of glass to create a plant frame.   Attach a small hook to the center of the inner frame at the upper side. Attach a chain to this and hang a planter from it – a small bucket or basket planter works well for this. This is a neat way to display a trailing plant. It works nicely if you paint the frame in a color that complements your planter, and its flowers and foliage.  Gather a good collection of colorless cut glass plates and pot lids, decanter tops, and other clear glass items to create a glass mosaic.   Glue these to your clear glass window and fill in the spaces between them with clear glass beads or marbles. The idea for this display is to make it colorless but emphasize the textures provided by the cut glass items you use.  Since garden art lives outdoors, it’s best to protect it before leaving it out for extended periods of time.  Remember that any wood in contact with soil will get wet and may start to rot.       To preserve the life of your garden art, treat it with a wood preservative if it is in contact with the ground, or raise it on a pressure-treated wood block.	Make a simple bubble window. Create a window mosaic to bring color into your garden. Paint your own art onto old windows. Create a mini greenhouse planting display. Hang painted frames on chains. Create a false window on a fence. Use an old window as a planting display. Make a frame for your plants. Create a clear glass mosaic. Raise and treat your garden art to preserve it.
If you are more into a symmetrical look for the space, try arranging the accent pillows in symmetrical layers. This means having the same number of pillows on either side of your couch or bed. Layer them on top of each other so there are contrasting shapes, textures, and colors in the space.For example, you may layer one round, print accent pillow with one solid square accent pillow on either side of your sofa. Or you may layer two round solid accent pillows under a smaller square pillow on either side of your bed.  To create a good visual, arrange the pillows so they get smaller as they move towards the inside of your sofa or your bed. Keep the largest pillows on the far corners and the smaller pillows on the inside. This will ensure the space is comfortable to rest on and create a balanced visual.   For example, place a large square pillow first, followed by a smaller round pillow, and then a small bolster.  There is such a thing as too many accent pillows on your sofa or bed. Do not be afraid to remove any accent pillows from the space if it starts to feel overstuffed or overcrowded. Try testing out the accent pillows by sitting or lying down on the sofa or bed. If it feels like there are too many pillows and you cannot sit on the sofa or bed comfortably, you may need to remove some pillows.You should also consider the rest of the space. If the room has a lot of decoration and other furnishing, you may cut down on the number of accent pillows you use. If the room is more sparsely decorated, you may increase the number of accent pillows.	Organize the pillows in symmetrical layers. Arrange the pillows from biggest to smallest. Remove pillows if the space feels overcrowded.
A rookie mistake is listening to one kind of music -- you choose one or two of your favorite artists and only listen to them and then you wind up sounding just like them. Nah, you need your own sound. So spend as much time as possible listening to different sub-genres: ghettotech, Chicano rap, East Coast hip hop, low bap, mafioso, you name it. Become an expert. You're also checking out the competition!   Study all of hip-hop, from the beginning to the end. If you don't know many emcees, here's a few classic rappers everyone should know: Run DMC, Beastie Boys, Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Wu-Tang Clan, NWA, Public Enemy, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 5, A Tribe Called Quest, Common, KRS-ONE. Eventually you'll be a true hip-hop "head."; , No one would put Ghostface Killah, DMX, and Eminem in the same category. Every artist has their schtick. They make similar music, but they twist it in very different ways. In general, here are your categories:    Hustler rappers. Their music is mainly about selling drugs, CDs, or however it is they're making ends meet. Similar to glamour rappers who brag about fast cars, money, jewelry, and women. It's highly materialistic content. Not hard to find these as they're the most common.  Conscience rappers. Sometimes referred to as a "backpacker rapper." This type of music focuses on more higher-minded things -- namely social or political issues, family, the concept behind drugs and the larger meaning of it all. A little philosophical -- a la Mos Def or Dead Prez.  Storyteller rappers. They're just that -- storytellers. Generally it's about them or their opponent, but the topic can obviously vary. Think Raekwon and Nas.  Political rappers. They're similar to conscience rappers, but they concentrate on the pitfalls of society and are usually blatantly anti-establishment. Public Enemy or even Macklemore.  Tongue twisters. Can rap at double the speed of normal rap (generally in 8/4 time). Similar to the "pure lyricist," who concentrates on difficult beat and rhyme patterns, large words, and burning their opponent over and over and over. Look to Busta or Twisted Insane for good examples.  Freestyling comes with time. For right now, grab that pen and paper and let your mind go. You can wax later. Think of any topic -- the couch you're sitting on, the second-hand backpack you were forced to use for years, your hatred of Jimmy Kimmel, whatever. And then start streaming those gems.   The easiest way to get started is to think of the ends first. You can use a rhyming dictionary if you like, but you'll have to rely on your own brain eventually. If you've got your first line ("Jimmy Kimmel, man, that time slot's just a waste of space"), come up with a list of words that rhyme with the last word (face, race, brace, case, trace). Where can you go from there? No one wants to hear rhymes that have been lifted from someone else. Don't be the Dane Cook of MCs. Even if your rhymes sound more like Dr. Seuss than Dr. Dre, if they're yours, they're better than if they're stolen.  Simply put, the more words you know, the more words you know that rhyme. And if you can drop a word that your opponent doesn't recognize, boom. Served (cue mic drop). So bust out that rhyming dictionary (there are a bunch online) and get to acquainting yourself with your own language. Your words are your power. With more words at your disposal, you'll be less likely to get tripped up when you're in a cipher.   Work with near rhymes, too. She knew that I really didn't wanna go/but she convinced me it'd be magical. The ends don't rhyme, but they sort of do. A good rhyming dictionary will have near rhymes, too. Don't limit yourself to straight up, solid rhymes. There's ton of wiggle room. And if it's hilarious, no one will really care.  Study rhyme pattern. It is crucial to the development of your unique voice that you develop your own flow-style. One beat could have a dozen ways to stream along it. When you hear a loop, how many ways can you imagine spitting to it?   Listen very carefully to rappers like Raekwon, Nas, Jay-Z, Biggie, Big Pun, any MC you can think of that has established a new and unique flow. Studying and learning about flow-techniques is learning mathematics in a way: you need to understand the rhythm, the beat, its structure, counting bars, where the groove comes from, where to place your rhymes and so forth.  Now you've got a few rhymes of your own you can experiment with -- so get started! Pull up some instrumental beats on YouTube and go. Use the same rhymes and try finding different rhythms to incorporate. What comes naturally and what doesn't? What sounds too repetitive and needs to be spiced up?   Sometimes your rhymes just won't fit a specific beat. If it's not working out, find a different track. Be patient -- it may take a while to find the sound you're looking for.  Ditch that pen and paper and start doing it off the cuff. The best MCs only need a few seconds to start dropping one-liners and biting rhymes. So get in your shower and start freestyling about how wonderful your soap is. Take any instance and work it. The goal is for someone to hand you any situation and you can run with it.   As you let yourself go -- and you need to truly let yourself go -- write down that line that you want to use for later reference. Not all of freestyling is truly 100% spontaneous. Most rappers have a store of end rhymes or lines that they can build new material off of to get started.  Every rapper has been in the moment where they need a second to regroup. When that time rolls around, you rely on a filler. It's just a simple phrase that gets you back to the top of the beat and can start a new stream of thinking. It's best to have two or three you can rely on when that dreaded time rolls around.   Don't overthink it. Your filler could be something like, "you know what I'm sayin'?" or "That's how I do." Generally picking a phrase that ends in a common sound is best.  You are not a WCW wrestler. Your music has to be genuine and real. The last thing you should be rapping about is your homies in Compton and how you need to powder your backhand when really you're sitting in Topeka, Kansas playing D&D by yourself. Stick to what you know, what you understand, and what you feel. Your music will be better and you'll get respect for it, regardless of what it is.   Freddie Gibbs got big rapping about Gary, Indiana. It's a perfect example of taking what you have and making it work. Because of that, his music is unique and undeniably creative (not to mention definitely his own). Your situation is not a burden. You just have to know how to spin it.  There is always something that eats at your soul and is constantly waiting for you to expose it. Becoming a good MC is about finding yourself and expressing it. So who are you? What's your sound? How do you flow?   Though it has nothing to do with your skill and acting becoming an MC, it helps to have the look, so we'll mention it briefly here: have the look. Match your music. If you rap about bling, you best have bling. If you're rapping about how tough it is having so much swag, you best have superfluous amounts of swag. If and when you hit it big, you won't be scrambling for an image and be caught getting "packaged."  , A cipher (or cypher) is when two people rap back and forth, feeding off of each other and making a friendly competition out of it (it is not a battle). So grab a buddy and spend a couple minutes rapping back and forth. Practice is the only way you'll get truly good at freestyling.   There's a couple things to aim for in this situation: 1) take your opponent's look/skills and address them when your turn is up, 2) pick up where they left off -- if they say, "Who do you think you are?" you literally answer them back, and 3) take their same flow initially, and then run away with it, doing your own thing. It creates a more cohesive feel (all of these do, actually).  Using your knowledge of current affairs, you can make apt, timely, cutting-edge similes and metaphors to give an edge to your rap battles and songs. Your words are your weapons, and you can use these to stop what is eating at you. And the crowd will go wild, too.   A story about your life is good; people may be able to understand and relate. But talking about a cultural-wide thing is something your entire audience can understand. They'll feel like they're in on the joke and get your message. So whether you're knocking Miley Cyrus or spitting your views on Obamacare, if it's relevant, it's good.  Plenty of MCs surround themselves with like-minded, equally talented people for an explosion of hip-hop creativity. Imagine the Wu-Tang Clan as just the, well, Wu-Tang Man. Totally lacking. So get to collaborating!   It's a good idea to work with someone who has some serious DJing skills. They'll be able to back you up and give you the feel that you need -- if they know what they're doing, that is. It also probably means they have gear. A hype-man or sidekick. Having someone else onstage that is full of verve and charisma that can chime in on your hooks or get the crowd going when you need a breather can make a huge difference when dealing with audiences.  Take some of your best rhymes and get to recording yourself. Not only will you be creating something you can give to others or post online, you'll be able to hear how you sound, where your strengths lie and where you need work. If you're not happy with it, you simply rerecord it.   You could make a demo, but that'll come in time. Right now you need some basic recording software and equipment or, if you've the moolah, some studio time. You can do it with everything from your computer's sound recorder and an instrumental track to getting more hi-tech with programs and software. We won't get into all the options because wikiHow has an entire category devoted to music producing and recording.  You're not just gonna put those recordings on your bookshelf and use them to lull yourself to sleep tonight, are you? Nope! Set up a Facebook page, Twitter, fancy Tumblr, Soundcloud and get going on generating attention. This is not a time to be modest -- right now you're selling yourself.   Did we mention YouTube? Definitely YouTube. Every platform you can imagine, put your name out there. When people wonder about you, all you have to do is hit 'em up with a link and they can start on getting addicted to your sound.  Now you gotta bring your skills to the live table. You're not just singing to your Dove bar anymore, you're not just spitting with your friends -- you need veritable gigs where you rap battle -- or at least showcase your rhymes to people who have yet been graced by your innovative beats. You'll develop the public appeal you've been waiting for and start working on that cred.   Hit up club owners with your recording. If they're interested, they may offer you a night as a "try-out." If no venue in your area is looking for that kind of music, go to open mic nights! Just having people hear you is the goal. Be confident, clear, articulate, and, above all, sober. You do not want to go into one of your first gigs under the influence of anything. Do a mic check beforehand, feel the vibe of the room, start bantering with the audience, and get into it. When you show you're into it, it allows the audience to get into it, too.  If that's the end goal, of course. It'll be easiest to do this with an agent, so start asking around! They can start sending your demo to people looking for the next best thing. If you send it, it may just get sorted into the trash bin. So grab your demo, grab your agent, and get to turning this into your career.   Be patient -- sometimes these things take years. Keep dominating cyberspace and marketing yourself, too. You never know who will run across your talent and want a piece! Take whatever gigs you can until that fateful day when your agent calls and says you have a bite. The rest is history!	Listen to hip-hop and rap 24/7. Think about different rappers and their "type.", Write your own rhymes. Expand your vocab. Experiment with flow. Use instrumentals. Start freestyling. Have a few fillers up your sleeve. Create real content. Develop your persona. Rap in ciphers with your friends. Pay attention to the news and what's trendy. Get a crew. Record yourself. Put yourself on the Internet. Get onstage. Start talking to labels.
, Wind it up until it's all curled around the cone. Remove carefully, keeping the pipe cleaner spring intact. One end should be narrow, the other wide.   You can also wind the pipe cleaner around a pencil or pen. This will achieve an all-one-size spring, so it will probably need to be shorter to ensure stability.  Adjust to ensure it's not wobbling.  Add further decorative elements if liked, otherwise, the alien is good to go.   Other things you might add include arms, feet, buttons, ray guns, rations in a bag, etc.	Select the pipe cleaner in a color you'd like for the alien in question.  , Curl the pipe cleaner around a small cone shape (you can make a cone using construction paper if need be, or use a piping cone). Glue the narrow end of the pipe cleaner spring under the pompom head. Allow to dry. Finished.
Be careful not to disturb or damage them while working around them.  Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them.,, The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released., aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off). "); so then align it as explained next. Caution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head. The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC ("top of the compression stroke"). Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the "number one spark plug hole" by a "compression gauge" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC. Required: securely place a "plastic/rubber" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably "not real cork" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the "rubber stop-block." Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will "turn" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two "open-end" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.).  Put on the parking brake.,, Then use a jack-stand to support the car. Do not depend on the jack to support it. You will be removing the wheel adjacent to (next to) the pulleys only.,, Watch your head., It should work under the air conditioner bracket which is massive on the older models. The engine being supported is because you will remove (not yet) the motor mount in steps when you get to it in a later step; that mount is between the top and lower halves of the timing-cover and is very much in the way of working on the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump., The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and even to see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension., You probably can wiggle and jiggle the pulley while start gently prying and pulling it off the crankshaft. If not, then you may need to use a steering wheel puller or similar puller., This was necessary to be able to remove the lower timing cover., One screw is hard to see in the middle of the cover, right below the motor mount.,	There or two of these cam shafts.Remove the OHC cam valve cover which is necessary to access the timing belt, the top of the timing belt sprockets, and the cam timing marks. Do not turn the engine using the cam timing sprockets or their retaining bolts, or by pulling on the timing belt. Align the timing marks on back of the cam sprockets lined up straight across, with a wrench on the retaining bolt of the harmonic pulley  Caution: with the negative terminal of the battery disconnected.   Caution: the TDC could be 180 degrees off of the correct TDC even when the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is correctly pointing straight up ("It would then be at the top of the exhaust stroke. Work on level ground and block the wheels (so they won't roll) with bricks or wooden pieces about the size of a bricks.Loosen the right front wheel lug nuts but leave them snug ("right side" as when you are seated in the car). Jack up that side of the car.Realize that later you will support the engine separately with a jack as explained when it is needed but you may need a different jack. Remove the plastic splash-guard cover under the engine which extends to cover the side of the wheel well. Support the engine securely but with just little/slight upward pressure with a "scissor jack" or "bottle jack" with a strong piece of wood (longer than a brick) to protect the engine from the jack. Remove the plastic top half timing-cover which is held on by 4 small bolts (10mm), with one near each corner. Remove the "harmonic pulley bolt" (21mm, 13/16 inch) that you had loosened earlier and remove the pulley. Put the bolt back in to hold the sprocket on and be sure the sprocket "key" is always kept in its slot. Remove the retaining screws from the lower half timing cover (10mm).Remove the lower timing cover carefully because you have to maneuver it to clear off of the sort of alignment pin-block (actually almost a little cube and is about 2cm) and is just above the crankshaft sprocket and fits into a place in the lower half cover but you can not see it until the cover is off.
Watering the soil deeply but infrequently is the best way to keep apple trees healthy.During the first two growing seasons, plan to water the tree deeply about twice a week. Don't water the tree after it rains, since this can cause it to become waterlogged and create rot around the roots.   If the leaves look dry and wilted during the growing season, you may need to increase watering. Check for signs of drought during the hottest times of year. As the tree gets older, water near the edges of the perimeter of the branches, since the roots grow outward and not downward.  Mulch helps to regulate the temperature around the base of the tree, keeping it from getting too hot or too cold. It also provides nutrients as it decomposes and keeps weeds from growing. Use a few inches of straw, wood chips or compost as mulch.Place the mulch in a wide circle around the base of the tree. Don't pile the mulch in a "volcano" shape around the base of the tree; rather, there should be a "donut" shape to keep the mulch from covering the tree's bark. Mulch will rot the bark, which can attract mice and hurt the tree.  A young tree doesn't need to be heavily pruned. For unbranched trees, also called whips, you can prune back 2-3 feet after planting. For other trees, remove dead branches as necessary. Then, start shaping the trees the year after planting. In order to direct growth into a few healthy branches, you can use a few techniques:   Rub off low-growing buds so that they won't grow into full-sized branches. If you want to slow growth and promote fruiting, bend a branch down horizontally (without breaking it) and tie it to a stake in the ground for a few weeks.Trees will require regular pruning to remove crossed or dead branches and promote good circulation. Cut away upright stems that grow high in the tree, and remove stems that are weak or droopy.  Deer, mice, rabbits and insects may be attracted to your apple tree. Keep your tree safe by protecting it in the following ways:   Keep deer out with fencing around your property Keep mice and rabbits out by installing wire mesh around the base of the tree. You can also avoid putting mulch right at the base of the trunk to discourage rodents. Keep maggots away from fruit by trapping them with hanging balls coated in a substance called "tangle trap" throughout the summer Keep the leaves and fallen apples cleaned up to avoid attracting pests	Keep the soil evenly moist. Mulch around the base of the tree. Don't prune too much until the tree is well established. Deter pests from damaging the tree.

Place a Frisbee down on a piece of colorful cotton fabric. Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to trace around the Frisbee, ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) from the edge., Measure around the Frisbee and add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for seam allowance. Draw a rectangle on the fabric that is 3½ inches (8.89 centimeters) wide and whatever the Frisbee's circumference is (plus the seam allowance).You can draw the rectangle on the same piece of fabric, or use a different color/pattern.  The circle will make the top of the Frisbee and the rectangle will make the inside hem., Fold the narrow ends of the rectangle together, right sides together. Sew along the edge using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance., This will make it easier to insert the elastic later on. If you'd like to, you can topstitch both of the hems down close to the seam. This will add an element of design and keep the hems from fraying., Working your way around the loop, fold one of the raw edges in by ¼-inch (0.32-centimeter). Press it flat with an iron as you go. When you are done, fold the edge in by ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) and press it with an iron once more. Make sure that you are folding towards the wrong side of the fabric., Try to sew as close to the inside, folded edge as you can so that you'll have room for the elastic. Leave a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) gap between the start and end of your sewing so that you can insert the elastic.  You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.  Turn the circle so that the right side is facing you. Make sure that the wrong side of the loop is facing out, then pin the remaining raw edge all the way around the circle., Use a ¼-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance and a matching thread color. When you are done sewing, consider cutting notches into the seam. This will make the cover lay more smoothly after you turn it inside out., Frisbee, then cut some ⅜-inch (0.95-centimeter) wide elastic according to that length. Use a safety pin to thread the elastic through the opening in the hem. Remove the safety pin when you are done., Overlap the ends until the loop rests neatly against the circle. Sew the ends together using a straight stitch. Trim off any excess elastic, if necessary.  Don't make the elastic too tight. You want to be able to stretch the cover over your Frisbee. Don't make the elastic too loose, or the cover will fall off. Give your Frisbee a nicer finish by tucking the elastic into the hem, then stitch the 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) gap shut.  At this point, your cover is complete, and ready to be slipped over a Frisbee. If you want to, press both sides of the cover with an iron first, before slipping it over a Frisbee.	Use a Frisbee to trace a circle on a piece of fabric, including seam allowances. Draw a narrow rectangle on the fabric, long enough to wrap around the Frisbee. Cut the fabric out along the lines that you drew. Sew the narrow ends of the rectangle together to make a loop. Press the seam open with an iron. Fold one of the raw edges over twice to make the hem. Topstitch the hem down, leaving a small gap. Pin the loop to the circle with the right sides facing in. Sew around the circle. Thread some elastic through the loop's hem. Sew the ends of the elastic together. Turn the cover inside out.
The flowers should be in full bloom, in good condition and without flaws.; , Suitable desiccants include silica gel, sand or borax. Silica gel is probably the simplest, so it's the method used here.  Grind the gel down before using (place in a plastic bag and roll over with a rolling pin). Clean everything thoroughly afterward.   If you don't want to grind down the gel, mix it with 1 part fine sand to parts of silica gel.  A shoebox or similar box will work well. Poke holes across the base of the box.  Make sure that the paper goes up the sides of the box too, as you'll be pulling it out later, while the flowers and gel are still on top of it. Fill the box with a layer of the desiccant to about 1/2 an inch/1.5 centimeter (0.6 in).  Check that the flowers are completely dry before adding them; the less moisture, the better.  Place the lid on the box (or cover firmly with brown paper and tie it down). Let sit in a dry, cool place for 5 to 10 days.  If the silica gel has changed color from bright blue to pink, this is a sign it has absorbed moisture from the flowers. If the flowers are papery, they're dry.  Let the silica gel fall through the holes into a container for disposal. Make the holes bigger if needed.  When most of the silica gel is out of the box, pick up the roses. They can now be used for craft, floral arrangement or whatever else you have in mind.	Select suitable flowers. Choose a desiccant method for drying the flowers. Purchase silica gel from the store or online. Choose a box for holding the flowers while they dry. Line the box with tissue paper or newspaper. Lay the chosen flowers onto the silica gel. Cover gently with more silica gel. Check to see how the flowers have dried. Gently slide the paper out from under the flowers, pulling it up the side of the box. Remove the dried Christmas roses.
A table as high as your hips is ideal. Do not place the can on your lap or in between your legs. The knife could slip and injure you.  Grip the top of the knife with your palm directly over the joining place. Your fingers should rest against the side of the handle, safely away from the sharp edge of the blade.Make sure you have a firm grip. This method can be dangerous if your hand or the knife is slippery. Do not use this method with a knife smaller than a chef's knife. A chef's knife is a large, heavy knife that weighs more than a pruning or steak knife. You need the relatively heavy weight of the blade to effectively puncture the lid of the can.  The heel of the knife is the place where the blade is widest. It's at the opposite end of the blade from the tip. Place it up against the raised lip at the edge of the can's lid.   The heel should be centered right under the place where your palm is gripping the knife. Make sure it is firmly positioned against the edge of the lid, so it won't slip.  Press down firmly so that it punctures the can, creating a small hole. If you have trouble puncturing the can, try standing up and leaning over it. Hold the knife in place with one hand. Place the other hand on top. Apply steady pressure with both hands and push down until the can is punctured.   Do not strike the can to puncture it. The knife may slip and injure you. Instead, apply slow, steady pressure until the knife breaks through the can. Don't be tempted to use the sharp tip of the knife to puncture the can. The heel is more stable and less likely to slip. Also, if you use the tip you'll ruin the edge on your blade.  Move it a few centimeters along the edge of the lid. Use the same technique to create another hole right next to the first one.  Circle the entire lid, just as you would with a can opener. The lid should now be loose.  Insert the tip of the knife into one of the holes. Push up to pry off the lid. Be careful to point the edge of the blade away from your body so that it won't hurt you if it slips. Remove and discard the lid.   If necessary, use a smaller knife to saw through remaining connected parts of the lid. Consider covering your hand with a towel or your sleeve before prying off the lid. This will protect your hand from getting scratched by the sharp lid.	Position the can on a stable surface. Hold the knife where the handle meets the blade. Position the heel of the knife against the inner edge of the lid. Press the heel of the knife into the can. Scoot the knife over and make a new hole. Continue until you've punctured holes around the edge of the can. Pry open the lid.
A whole team will be working on your child's education, so it can help to get to know who will be there. You may only be able to familiarize yourself with their positions ahead of time, but that will help you navigate the meeting better.The team will usually include a regular education teacher, a special education teacher, someone from the school system who is familiar with the special education programs, someone knowledgeable in interpreting the evaluation results, and anyone else you invite who knows the child's abilities well, such as a daycare provider.Ahead of time, think about whether or not you want to bring anyone in particular. It can even just be a trusted friend who helps you take notes.; , The IEP has standard parts, and knowing those parts beforehand can help you handle the meeting better. Of course, it will have things about where your child is at right now, including the ways their disability affects them. It will also have goals for your kid.There'll also be info on what services your child will get, as well as how long each day your kid will be apart from nondisabled children. It will also lay out whether or not your child will be included in standardized assessments (the dreaded standardized tests), as well as how your kid's progress will be measured.  Evidence is always helpful when it comes to this type of meeting, so don't be afraid to back yourself up with some help. Even if certain people can't be at the meeting, you can still bring statements from them. For instance, if your child's doctor has something important to contribute, you can ask them to jot something down about it for you to take., Before the meeting, your child will be evaluated to determine what help they need. You should be given access to this information, and it can be helpful to read this ahead of time. You may find that you disagree with certain parts, and that's important information to bring up at the meeting., Part of the meeting will be setting goals for the year. You should think about that ahead of time so you can be ready to speak up when the time comes.Think about your child's abilities. What do you think they can do in the next year? What would you like to see them do? Try to be realistic. It might help to write down the goals to bring to the meeting.  If you don't speak English as a first language, the district will usually provide an interpreter for you. You must ask at least 3 days ahead of time, though, so don't be afraid to speak up. Call the school to request one., The school has to make it so you or your partner can attend, meaning that they must give you sufficient notice. If they don't, you can ask them to reschedule. Usually, the meeting will be held at your child's school., One of the big things that you contribute to the meeting is talking about what your kid can do. You know your kid better than anyone, and you can help focus the discussion both on the places your kid can do well and the places they need help growing.You can also talk about your kid's interests, as well as things that only you know about.  The evaluation is the professional assessment of your child. If you think something about the evaluation is wrong, you have a right to speak up. You may think that your kid has more ability than what was determined by the evaluation. On the other hand, you may think your child needs more help than what was established by the evaluation. Keep in mind, though, that school is likely to want some kind of support from you to back up your claims., Usually, you help create the IEP at the meeting. Sometimes, though, the school will have written out an IEP ahead of time. You may also be revising the IEP from the previous year. If you feel like something is wrong with it, let your voice be heard. You are your child's advocate.Also, don't be afraid to bring up suggestions about things you may want added to the IEP.  These meetings may get a bit jargon-heavy at times, and the other team members likely don't even realize they're doing it. It's fine to ask questions. You're not expected to know every single piece of terminology ahead of time., Most schools suggest a child starts attending meetings at age 15 or 16. However, if you believe your child is able to understand what's going on at the meeting, it can be critical that they attend, even at a younger age. For instance, even upper elementary students may want to attend. They should be able to contribute to a conversation about their education.Some parents advocating for always bringing your child, as that gives all the evaluators a chance to see your child again. Some of them may have only had one interaction with your child. Also, having your child there helps to remind the team that their decisions affect an actual person. Most schools will be open to this idea, but you may need to sell some schools on it. Of course, you don't want to take your child kicking and screaming to the meeting. If they don't want to go, wait until the next year or whatever age they seem ready. Alternatively, maybe some kids just want to listen in the meeting and not speak up.  Talk to your child about why the meeting is happening. If they don't know they are receiving extra help, the meeting isn't the time to spring it on them. Also, you should talk about how the meetings usually go so that your kid has a good understanding ahead time of what will happen., The goal-setting part of meeting is a good place for your kid to offer some suggestions. You may need to exclude them from other parts of the meeting to discuss certain things. You can discuss the more sensitive information at the beginning of the meeting, then invite your child in for the goal-setting. That's a great place for kids to advocate for themselves and take control of their education.Your kid may also want to be there for accommodations, where they are talking about the help your child may need on tests. That way, your child can ask for what they need.	Get to know the team. Note all the parts of the IEP ahead of time. Gather information from those who can't be there. Review the evaluation. Be ready with goals. Ask for an interpreter. Get the time and date. Talk about what makes your kid unique. Bring up any disagreements you have with the evaluation. Advocate for adjustments to the IEP. Ask questions. Advocate for your child to attend. Discuss what's going to happen ahead of time. Focus on the goal-setting part of the meeting.
Cut the paper as wide as you want; a wider strip means both more drawing surface and a bigger figure to draw. If you wish to be really precise, try folding the paper and then cutting the strips on the creases. If you have a ruler, you can measure to be exact., Make the folds as even as possible.          A good trick is to first fold the strip in half multiple times. When the desired rectangle size is met, unfold the paper. Using the creases made from the folding, fold it accordion-style., For this step, you can draw it free-hand or use a stencil. Draw the person with the head, feet, and hands touching all the edges.  As you cut, you can trim out any imperfections from the drawing. Cut carefully in order to keep the chain intact.  The chain of people should be holding hands.  Paper-people chains are neat in and of themselves, but with some markers, crayons, or color pencils, you can draw details on the people. Be creative and pick themes, draw different clothing, add stickers, or glue some glitter.	Cut a long strip of paper. Fold the paper accordion style to make a rectangle. Draw the outline of a person in the middle of the rectangle. Cut out the person. Unfold the paper slowly. Work with the finished product.

For this costume, you'll need to find a white or light blue singlet. This will form the base of your costume, and is a great option for young kids. The stretchy fabric of the singlet will allow children to move more freely, even while in costume. It's likely all of your materials can be purchased from a craft store, so be sure to bring your supply list:   Light blue or white singlet Light blue or white skirt Safety pins Light blue or white see-through fabric Plastic tiara (optional) Fabric pens (optional)  , The snow and ice theme that Elsa uses in her costume can be imitated by using both blue and white in your costume.You may want a blue singlet and a white skirt, or the other way around.  In the movie Frozen, Elsa has a beautiful see-through cape that trails behind her wherever she goes.You can give this effect to your costume by cutting a length of your see-through fabric slightly narrower than waist width if you are attaching it to the waist, and flare it slightly toward the bottom.   A waist-cape is recommended for young children to prevent any accidents or choking while at play, but older children may want a full cape. You can do this by cutting your fabric a little narrower than shoulder width and flaring it toward the bottom.  You may have to make some adjustments when you put the costume on for the first time, but your cape can be easily made by attaching your fabric with safety pins. Along the back half of the waist of your skirt, pin your see-through fabric.   For a full length cape, use your safety pins to attach your fabric along the back half of the neckline. You may want to use very small safety pins, which will hide more easily in the folds of your cape.  Start with the singlet and then add the skirt to it. Make sure you have smoothly tucked the singlet into the skirt so that the top is smooth and regal. Check your cape for balance and length, too. You may need to shorten the length or fluff it along the neck or waist to give it more lift.  But before you add a tiara to the costume, you might want to do a simple, yet cute, hairstyle. You might even want to take the singlet off and add some princess themed designs with fabric pens.   Your Elsa princes costume might benefit from some snowflakes drawn on it, or maybe a few snowmen. A little glitter on this costume can give you the sparkling appearance of a snow princess.	Gather your materials. Consider offsetting your colors. Cut the fabric for your cape. Attach your cape. Try the costume on. Add accessories worthy of a princess.
In most cases, you'll receive a piece of paper explaining the requirements for each instrument, including prepared exercises, scales, and sight-reading.; , Your director may give you one, but if your music is found in a file on the internet or a method book, make sure to get hold of it as soon as possible.  A friend, older band member, band director, or other musical acquaintance will likely be willing to help you out.  This includes the chromatic scale, which will likely be a requirement as well. In many auditions, points are given for octaves - three octaves, for instance, will obviously be worth more than two (however, you may only get all of the points if you do well on every octave). You need all the points you can get, so if you can play a second or third octave, do so. However, keep in mind that you will most likely have a time limit to play the scales, so don't add too many extra octaves, and it's better to play "easy" octaves well than to try to max yourself out and play sloppily (which means you'll lose more points than you might have gained for the extra octaves).  You can't practice the sight-reading piece ahead of time, obviously, but if sight-reading is difficult for you, practice will help keep you from being caught off guard.  You want to have your instrument sounding its best.	Make sure you know the audition requirements. Be sure to have a copy (or two) of the prepared piece(s). If the prepared piece is a bit over your head, by all means, ask for help!, Memorize (as this will likely be required) all the required scales as many octaves as possible. Practice sight-reading. Take your instrument to the repair shop for a COA (Cleaning, Oiling, Adjusting), and have any known problems fixed.
Cannas are a warm weather plant that don’t do well in cold weather. Wait until spring to plant your cannas--when the soil becomes soft and warm from sunlight, its time to get planting.If you live in a colder area where the warm season is rather short, you could consider starting your cannas in an indoor pot. See Part Three for how to care for indoor cannas.; , As tropical plants, cannas require a lot of sun. A lot of sunlight will allow your cannas to bloom to their full extent--and that’s something you definitely want. Cannas are known for the bright, beautiful flowers and intricate and colorful leaf patterns. Give your plant the sun it needs and you will be sure to have an exquisite garden.  While cannas will survive in almost any soil, it does need to be able to drain. The way to tell if you have found a good spot is to check on the spot after a rain shower (or hose shower). If the soil still has puddles five or six hours after a shower, you will have to find another spot. While cannas do like moist soil, they don’t like soggy roots.   If you don’t have another spot to plant you cannas, you can help your spot to dry by adding organic material to the spot. You can raise the level two or three inches using compost, peat moss, or ground bark--all of which you can buy at your local garden or yard supply store.  If you are going to plant one of the tall varieties of cannas, you will need to choose a spot where these tall beauties will be relatively protected from strong wind. In a strong wind, cannas stalks can snap or bend in a damaging way., You can do this with a tiller or garden fork. Mix in a layer of compost that is 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 cm) deep. The compost will give the soil an extra boost of nutrients that your cannas will appreciate., Place a single tuber (or rhizome) in the hole with the eye (or growing points) facing up. Plant additional tubers approximately 1 foot (.30 m) apart for dwarf to medium varieties and at least 2 feet (.61 m) apart for tall varieties., Press the soil down and water thoroughly. Watering the area will help to settle the soil around the tuber.  The mulch will help retain moisture and will also keep the weed population at bay., Your sprouts should begin to show their heads a couple of weeks after planting, though if you live in a colder climate it might take a week or two longer. Cannas need heat to help them begin growing. For optimum blooming, apply a fertilizer rich in nitrogen to cannas about once a month.  Cannas need moist soil, so its important to water your cannas regularly. If you live in an area where rainfall is one inch or less (2.54 cm) each week, you will need to water your cannas once a week. If you find yourself in a dry spell, water whenever you notice the soil getting dry., If you notice that your taller cannas are a little droopy, tie them to stakes to help them grow and support their own weight. Learn how to stake your plants here.  As your plant’s flowers bloom and fade away, remove the dead foliage. You can tell what is dead by looking for a faded brownish yellow color. Pick these away, taking care that you don’t disrupt the still living parts of the plant. Do not cut leaves until they yellow because they will continue to provide nutrients to the plant even when it is not blooming., If you live in an area that gets frost, you will need to dig up your rhizomes after the frost kills the foliage of your cannas. Cut the plants back so that they are six inches tall and carefully dig the rhizomes up from the ground.   Some cannas specialists believe that you should let the rhizomes dry for several days before moving onto the next step., Both peat moss and perlite can be purchased at your local garden supply store. Once you have filled the box, place each bunch of rhizomes in the box, making sure that each plants rhizomes don’t touch one another.   You can also put them in a brown paper bag lined with peat moss or perlite if you don’t have a plastic box to spare.  You should pick a spot that can have a maintained temperature of 45 to 55 degrees F (7.2 to 12.7 degrees C). Check on them every once in a while. If you notice that the moss is getting dry, lightly spray it with water so that it gets slightly damp. Your cannas will go into hibernation during this time, and will be able to be replanted in the spring, just like the first time you planted them., Dwarf cannas grow to about three feet tall. They come in a variety of colors, such as the bright red Ambassador or the City of Portland, which is known for its salmon color. Regular cannas are much larger in size, so dwarf cannas tend to grow better when potted., Potted cannas will grow in almost any potting medium that can be purchased at a garden supply store--they’re really not very picky. However, it must be soil that drains well, as cannas don’t do well with soggy roots and could develop mold.  You will also have to choose your container based on the size of the variety of canna you are choosing to plant. If you are not sure how large your specific canna can grow, run an online search or ask someone to help you at your garden supply store.Remember, you can plant your cannas with other plants in your container, but just remember that all of the plants in one container must have the same water and sunlight needs or else they will not do very well.  Plant your rhizomes (or tubers) in these holes, making sure that each dwarf or medium rhizome is at least 1 foot (.30 m) away from the next rhizome, unless you are planting them in a container, in which case you can often fit two or three tubers in a container. If you have a larger variety of canna rhizome, make sure that there is at least 2 feet (.61 m) distance between rhizomes. Make sure that the growing points (or eyes of the tuber) or pointing up., You should water your cannas right after you plant them so that the soil will settle around them and they can start to grow. When they have begun to sprout, water your plant as much as needed, keeping an eye on the soil to make sure that it is always relatively moist (though not soaking wet).  It is recommended that you bring your cannas outside so that they can get full sunlight during the warm months. If you do choose to keep them inside, make sure they are near a window that provides them with bright sunlight for most, if not all, of the day.  If you did bring your cannas outside for the summer months, make sure that you bring them back inside before the first frost has the chance to harm them. Store them indoors where the temperature stays at around 45 and 60 degrees F (7.2 to 15.5 degrees C).You can also dig up the rhizomes and store them in a plastic box with peat moss or perlite.	Wait until any threat of frost has passed before planting your cannas. Look for a spot with full sunlight. Look for a spot where the soil drains well. Keep the wind in mind when selecting your spot. Loosen the soil to a depth of approximately 12 to 15 inches (30.48 to 38.1 cm). Dig a 2 to 3 inch (5.08 to 7.62 cm) hole for each bulb. Cover the holes and the tubers with soil. Add a thin layer of mulch over the flowerbed. Keep an eye out for sprouts. Water your cannas regularly. Give your taller cannas some support. Pick away dead flowers. Move your cannas indoors after the first frost. Fill a plastic box with peat moss or perlite. Store the boxes so that they are not sitting on the floor. Consider buying dwarf cannas for your planter. Use well-drained, good quality soil. Purchase a pot with drainage holes. Dig holes that are 4 to 6 inches deep (10 to 15 cm). Water your cannas. Make sure your potted cannas get plenty of sunlight. Bring your pot inside before the first frost.
You obviously have to enjoy their music. The band plays typically hard rock and glam metal. A song that will show their typical sound would be Rebel Love Song. Other songs you should check out include Fallen Angels, Ritual, In the End, Smokes & Mirrors, Hello My Hate, Sex & Hollywood, Nobody's Hero and The Legacy.; , Many fans don't know who the band really are supposed to be. In fact, they don't notice the rock bands the band lights in their music. Some fans tend to just like the band because they saved their life or because they think Andy Biersack is cute. The band are pretty much bringing back the older sound of rock n' roll from around the 1980s. They slowly sound more old-school from album to album. Their debut album was more of melodic metalcore than glam metal or hard rock. Although it does have a lot of glam influences. The band carry the hard rock style of KISS and the glam metal vein of Mötley Crüe. The band's appearance is the stereotypical rockstar image. They look and sound as if Mötley Crüe or KISS had kids who became rock musicians. They have big, black, smeared makeup (although recently they haven't worn makeup), tattoos, black leather, tight clothes, studs and they even have long hair and they also stick out their tongues and do the matoik. The band abandoned the melodic metalcore style of their debut and moved to hard rock and glam metal with the second album, Set the World on Fire. At that time, that's when the band began to look like KISS, Mötley Crüe and Alice Cooper. The band have been praised by plenty of rock legends now such as Zakk Wylde, Gene Simmons, Alice Cooper and Dee Snider. Even the band has toured with Mötley Crüe and are friends with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe.  The members are Andy Biersack (vocals), Christian "CC" Coma (drums), Jinxx (guitar), Jake Pitts (guitar) and Ashley Purdy (bass).  You'll definitely find it at any music store as well as Target, Walmart and iTunes and Hot Topic  , Despite many fans listen to Asking Alexandria, Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Escape the Fate, I See Stars, As I Lay Dying, Pierce the Veil, Blood on the Dance Floor, Sleeping With Sirens, Of Mice & Men, etc, those bands are nothing similar to the style of Black Veil Brides. Try the following artists/bands who are most likely similar or might be doing what Black Veil Brides is doing: KISS, Mötley Crüe, LA Guns, Blessed By a Broken Heart, Sixx AM, Alice Cooper, Guns N Roses, Scorpions, Toxicrose, Avenged Sevenfold, Murderdolls, etc. ,	Check out their music. Understand what the band really are. Know the members. Get some of their merchandise or albums. Listen to similar bands. Go to their concerts.  , Check them out on YouTube, Spotify, Last.fm or Pandora.
Avoid cutting them back until they are completely withered. This will usually take about six weeks. Even though it might look scraggly, the foliage collects the sun's energy through photosynthesis and pumps it down into the bulb so it can grow next year. If you want, you can cut the spent flower early, but be sure to leave the stem intact.; , If you’re going to leave them in the ground, that’s all you need to do. Normal watering of the garden and winter rains will not bring them up to bud until they are “ready”. That’s it. If your preference is to bring them up for over-summer storage, proceed to the next step.  Try to bring the bulb up with one clean spade full of soil and the bulb. Use care not to damage the bulb. Handle them gently, because bruising them will cause them to rot.  Any bulbs that are clumped together will probably separate on their own as you brush off the dirt. Leave the ones that are firmly attached to the mother bulb as is. Remove any “caked-on” moist soil that is clinging to the bulb.  Discard bulbs that do not appear to be healthy.  Then, with a brush or a towel or rag, remove any additional clinging soil.  A mesh onion bag or the leg cut from a pair of pantyhose or nylon stocking works very well. Inexpensive tulle from a fabric store can be used to fashion a bag, too. Close up the opening of the bag with twine or string, leaving enough excess to form a loop for hanging. You can also rest them on an old window screen set on two boxes or sawhorses so that air can flow underneath them.  Far corners (away from the door) of the garage are fine, but avoid placing the bag near a water heater or laundry appliances. Generally, a shady spot with good air circulation is good.  If you're using a bag and you've hung it indoors, you can simply leave them alone until you’re ready to do Autumn planting. If you used a window screen or if you left your bulbs outside, bring them in and put them in a paper bag for storage in a dark, cool, well-ventilated spot.  Look for any signs of rot or mildew and discard them if they do not appear healthy. Plant the remaining bulbs and wait for them to bloom in the Spring!	Allow the blossom and the leaves to completely fade on their own. Snip off the blossom (if you haven't done so already) and the withered leaves right at the soil line. Dig deep into the soil several inches away from where the bulb is located. Clean off the bulb by brushing excess soil away with your fingers. Examine the bulbs for any signs of rot, deterioration or damage that may have been caused by nibbling critters. Set the bulb aside in open air for a short period of time (usually about an hour) until the last bit of soil has dried. Loosely place the bulbs into a well-ventilated bag. Hang the bulb-filled bag in an area that will not be exposed to direct sunlight, heat or dampness. Allow the bulbs to cure. Examine the bulbs again before replanting them.
and you should draw or look online for a base. Make sure that it has the shape you want your character to have. You have to think of the following:   Are they hairy, furry (animal fur), or do they have long hair or short hair? Do they have a beard or stubble (in the case of a man)? Are they thin, average, curvy, chubby, fat, or somewhere in between the above? Short, tall, or somewhere in between? Are they male, female, intersex, trans, or other?; , We are starting with the clothes so the base doesn't need a face or details yet. When you have the base you will start by choosing if you want your character to have a shirt and pants or maybe a dress. Draw the shape roughly and make a few copies. You can do this by scanning it in and printing it or put a paper over the first design and draw over the edges. Now you can start drawing the designs in the clothes. After you draw all the designs, it is recommended to scan in the drawing as a backup.  Choose what colors you want to use. If you scanned them, in you can print them out and have more of every design so you can experiment with the colors. Try out every color combination you want and also show all of them to family and friends, to hear what they think. You can also post it online on a forum and hear what they think of it there, or post it in social media. Choose the design everyone likes best. When choosing, remember that you will make the final product so you have the decision which one it will be. If everyone says that design 4 is best but you mostly like 1, you should remember them both.  Draw the face in different ways. Go past steps 2, 3 and 4. Keep the clothe designs in mind. Now put the two together. If it doesn't fit, try to change the clothes or the face. Show everything that comes out of this to your family and friends. Again ask what they like best. You can also ask it online again. Go with what you all like best. If less then 40% of the questioned liked the design you liked most, it is probably best to go for (one of) the other design(s).  Draw different bases, draw the detail in, color them, show them to family and friends and most important make them work with each other. If you have part of the objects with dark blue, black and gray and give it sharp corners, you don't want a bright red with green round object in there.  If this looks good, congratulations, you have your first character concept art! If it doesn't look good, try to make it look good with each other. After you have done this, you can go back to step 1 for the next character, or you can move on to drawing your comic, recreating the drawings in 3D for your game, look for actors/actress who look like it for your movie, or whatever else you want to do with it. If you want to use it in a comic, it is smart to make more concept arts from different sides, but with the looks of the final drawing. If you want to use it in a game, you could scan the drawing and recreate it in 3D by importing it in the background of your 3D modeling software and coloring it in in 3D. If you want to use it for a movie, you should think of what materials you could use to make the costume (and objects) and look for an actor/actress who looks somewhat like your drawing.	Decide if you want this character to be a male or a female (or a robot, or an animal, etc.), Start drawing. Color them in. Start designing the character itself. Go past steps 2, 3 and 4 for the objects. Try out your objects with the character.
First, look at the table of contents. Take note of how many chapters or sections there are and how many pages are in each. Flip through the book and take notes of charts, pictures, or subsections. Take a stab at what the book will cover ahead of time, this will assist with “active reading” later., For example, If there are fifteen chapters and you have three hours, you should divide 180 (60 minutes x 3) by fifteen. In this example, each chapter will take, on average, 12 minutes. Whatever the amount of time you calculate, this is not a hard and fast time, it is just a tool to help you keep track of your time and progress. You need to factor in times for breaks and also understand that some chapters will take longer amount of time and some will take a shorter amount of time to complete.  Knowing your goals will help you pay attention to the right things and not waste time on irrelevant aspects of the book.Are you going to be quizzed on the material? Are you trying to learn a specific skill from the pages? Are you supposed to be paying attention to certain aspects of the book (a character, the way the author uses language, etc.)? Knowing exactly what you need to get out of the reading will help you focus on what’s important and not waste time reading and retaining something immaterial to your goal.  Whether you use your finger, a piece of a paper, a bookmark, or a pen, a pointer will help guide how much you read.Hold it up to the word or line of text and move it as you complete reading.Sometimes you will want to read faster, sometimes you will want to read slower. The more you use it, the more it will guide how quickly you can read.  Don’t wait for the story to come to you. Anticipate what is going to happen and what you need to retain, and look for those, whether they are facts, plot points, or important themes., Instead of reading every sentence, let your eyes grab onto the major words. After time you will find that you can take in the bigger meaning of the paragraph with just these few words. You can always quickly rescan if you want to retain more information., Instead of your eye tracking every single word, take advantage of your peripheral vision to see what is coming ahead of time. Begin to see text as a group of words that you can take in all at once., Subvocalization is when you see a word and then think the entire word in your head. If you stop doing this, you will save a lot of time while reading. In order to turn off this part of your mind, you can occupy it with something else, like you can chew gum, counting from one to ten over and over again, or keep repeating a-e-i-o-u in your head., Speed reading is a specific skill that takes practice and dedication. There are many apps and books you can get to help you do this, but it might not be worth it if you need to read a chapter book in 2-3 hours today. Keep in mind that sometimes speed-reading can affect your comprehension, so there is a trade off., Occasionally you will come across an important part of the book. At these places it is important to stop skimming and read more deeply so you will retain more. Reading an important part closely is as important as reading a lot of parts not closely. If you can tell it is an important part of the book, you may want to mark it with a pen, highlighter, pencil, bookmark, or turning the page down., Instead of squeezing your reading time into an already full day, set aside in 2-3 hours of reading like it was an activity or event you need to show up at.By dedicating specific time to reading, you will limit distractions and interferences., You will want to read in a quiet place with no distractions, not a convivial area where you might begin a conversation or get distracted by conversations around you.You might want to go to a library or stay in your house when it is empty. Avoid places that will trigger interruptions or disturbances—you may fall asleep in your bed, you may look for food in a kitchen., Because you will be in one place for several hours, you will want to make sure you are not in pain and will remain comfortable for a long amounts of time.   Pay attention to your posture. Make sure the lighting is good so you will not strain your eyes. Make sure you have lower back support, either from a chair, a pillow, or a rolled-up sweatshirt., It will be very tempting to put down the book and do something else. You must resist these distractions and plan for them ahead of time. Turn off your phone. Stay away from a computer, handheld device, video games, or television.Even food can be a distraction. Make sure you have eaten ahead of time or have a snack on hand so that you will not get up and go somewhere else.  If you are reading in a short amount of time, you will need to stay focused. You should read the book during the time of day you feel most alert.For example, do not begin reading right before you typically go to sleep, or you risk falling asleep. You can also try drinking caffeine or drinking cold water.	Look at the text ahead of time. Calculate how long you should spend on each section. Review what your goals are. Use a guide or pointer. Be an active reader. Scan for important words. Relax your face, don’t let your eye take in every word. Stop subvocalization. Learn speed-reading. Know when to stop skimming and start reading. Schedule your reading session. Choose a quiet environment. Make yourself comfortable. Avoid distractions. Be awake and alert.
Use a bucket to pour the water into the bowl. The hot water will help dislodge the residue that might be slowing the flow of water out of the bowl.Let the hot water sit in the toilet, don’t flush it.  Make sure to use a product suitable for a toilet. The product you choose should have instructions detailing the amount you should be using.  Make sure to read the label carefully. Some products aren’t meant for use on ceramics, and may require that you use protective equipment. Always follow the instructions listed on the product. Some drain cleaner may require immediate flushing, whereas others need time to work before being flushed.  You can find this upright pipe in the toilet’s tank. It will usually have a small tube running into it.You should put a small amount of dishwashing liquid in, only about a tablespoon., This will give the dishwashing liquid time to seep down the overflow pipe. Additionally, the calcium and other deposits will slowly dislodge from the toilet’s walls, making for an easy clean., This will send water through the tank’s pipes, and out through the holes below the toilet rim. The dishwashing liquid will dislodge any residue in the tank. The drain cleaner will remove any clogs or mineral deposits in the drain, improving the toilet’s flow.	Pour a gallon of hot water into the toilet. Pour drain cleaner into the toilet. Put dishwashing liquid in the overflow pipe. Let the toilet sit for 10 minutes. Flush the toilet.
This may be a subtle theme or the entire base of your room. Most room decorating articles say this, but it is quite important, otherwise your room will look random and untidy. If your walls are non-paint-able you may wish to add a large, coloured pin-board to your room. If you're lucky, your room came with one of these, but they are relatively easy to make and a savior when it comes to colour themes.; , You really should start over as new as possible. This means deciding what you don't need anymore, and what you can tidy away into your cupboard. Don't go too overboard though. You don't want to throw away things that you may want or need in the future. Create a storage space in your cupboard and hide away the things that don't suite your rooms desired look.  Look over your room: the colour of the walls, ceiling and carpet, the window frames, the colour of the doors... everything matters. Usually most of the above are a white or creamy colour, which can be good or bad (you decide). Also look at the position of the windows in your room, and how much natural light is let in. This overview of your room will give you and idea of what extra furniture or decorations you will need.   If your room is small and doesn't get much light, consider it more of a "night-time room". If your room is airy and gets a lot of sun, it is most probably a "day-time room". Some rooms are lucky enough to be both. Examples of this are rooms with slanting ceilings, skylights, or attic rooms. Although it may seem annoying, these rooms can look wonderful with the right decoration.  Put all the small things in a pile outside your room (books, reading lamps, tissue boxes), leaving the big things (like beds, dressers or bookshelves) in your room. This way you will be able you move your furniture into the position you want it in freely. Once you have done this you will be able to bring in the necessities, like the lamp and the books for the shelf, leaving the decorations till last.  Maybe you decided your room is a night-time room, so you got some fairy-lights. If it is a day-time room, you may have bought a couple of bean bags and made some tissue-paper fairy balls. Whatever it is, leave the decorating till last. If you don't you may later realize that that space is needed for something more important.	Decide on a colour theme. Tidy up!, Go with what you've got. Shuffle your things around. Decorate!
Use your trowel to spread a few slabs of mortar around the corner's base of the footing. Spread the mortar 1" deep and 8" wide in the marked area. Continue to spread the mortar to account for the distance of about three to four blocks.  It is important to lay the corner block down first. Again, use a corner block if they're available. Setting the corner first will ensure an even dispersal of the rest of the blocks.  Apply mortar to each side of the concrete block using your trowel. You'll need to apply at least an inch to each side. Once applied, position the stone in the desired location. Try to align the corner to the string set up earlier.   Don't apply mortar to outer edge of the corner. Try not to leave any gaps when applying mortar, or it’ll weaken the bond between the blocks.  Start laying blocks from the corner or edge of the wall so you can work in one direction.   Apply mortar at the end of the block before you place the block adjacent to it.  Before stacking more concrete blocks on top of your initial foundation, check if everything is aligned. Use your mason's level by laying it on the first set of blocks. Check both the outside and center section of the bricks.   Tap the blocks for any alignment adjustments while the mortar is still wet. Do not try to move a block after the concrete has set. Measure the length and height every two or three layers., Place the mortar 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep and use the same width as the width of the block. You can then spread the mortar so it covers the length of about 3 blocks in the direction that you are laying the bricks.  Lay the block down on top so the edge of the top block aligns with the halfway mark of the bottom block. You'll recognize the pattern as a standard among the construction sites. The top block will fit in between two bottom blocks.  If you built fairly high walls, consider adding reinforcements. You can also use reinforcements if the ground pressure on the site is not stable. Place the 1/4" reinforcement rods into the openings with the ends overlapping about 2" or 3".	Spread the mortar along the corner. Set the corner block. Apply mortar to the side. Continue to lay the concrete blocks. Check the alignment. Apply mortar to the top. Stack the blocks. Add reinforcement.
Try to match the style of your audition piece to the style of the musical you're auditioning for. There are different kinds of musicals. For example, RENT is a rock musical. If you were auditioning for RENT, you would not want to sing a classical ballad or a country song. Keep with the theme. Sing something from Jesus Christ Superstar or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.   Never audition with a piece from a show that the company has done in the past 5 years. They'll compare you with whoever did it in their production. They are working on something new and don’t want to just replicate a past performer. When auditioning, try to avoid songs that have been over sung, are too well known, or are too complex. You don’t want to be perceived as a novice. People in the theatre want performers that have an in-depth knowledge of theatre.Some commonly overdone songs are "Tomorrow" or "Maybe" from Annie, "Memory" from Cats, "Favorite Things" from The Sound of Music, any songs from Wicked, Phantom of the Opera or Les Miserables,"Somewhere Over the Rainbow" from The Wizard of Oz, "Don't Rain on my Parade" from Funny Girl, "Shy" from Once Upon a Mattress, "I Enjoy Being a Girl" from Flower Drum Song, "Seasons of Love" from RENT, or "In My Own Little Corner" from Cinderella. Disney films are great but not for auditions. Avoid using songs from Disney films. Do not sing anything made famous by a well known Broadway artist ("Taylor the Latte Boy" being a perfect example) Think carefully about a piece involving extensive profanity or innuendo.  Musicals aren’t all about music. In most musicals, you’ll have to go back and forth between singing and acting. Be prepared to show both skills. Don’t choose monologues that have been overdone. Producers, directors, and casting crew enjoy being surprised by monologue choices. If you choose a common one, they may not pay close attention to your prepared piece.Keep your monologue to under 2 minutes long. You want to be able to show a range of emotions in a short amount of time. The casting crew will be viewing dozens of people for this part and others. If they want something longer, they’ll ask for it. Choose a monologue from a play or a movie. Most monologues in musicals are used to set up songs, so they normally aren’t as developed as ones in plays or movies. Avoid monologues with really obscene language or gestures, thick accents, or too much movement. You want to emphasize your acting chops, not your ability to offend. Exceptions exist. You’ll want to gauge the tone of the musical you are auditioning for when prepping. If it is a raunchy musical, an unconventional and crass monologue may be a good choice., If there is a dancing portion of the musical, the audition will be run like a class. They’ll teach you the dance and then ask you to perform it. Regardless, you should practice a variety of dances. Learn new dances frequently. You’ll get better at learning dances quickly., Put your audition monologue and songs on tape before you audition. Then watch them. Just like athletes, you'll want to watch your performance, analyze it, and fix any errors or odd transitions. Look for strange body language, facial expressions, or speech abnormalities.   In your audition pieces, make sure you have an equal balance of facial expressions, hand gestures, and movement. It's great that you're using your hands to tell the story, but it won't impress anyone if your face looks like you're falling asleep. Keep every part of your body alert and in control.	Think strategically about your audition materials. Prepare a monologue. Practice dancing. Film yourself.
You probably want to borrow or rent one from a school or music store unless you're absolutely sure you're going to stick with the instrument. Many beginners prefer models like the Yamaha student alto (YAS-23), or a Conn New Wonder that has been overhauled but on a beginner level, but anything available from a respectable source like Sam Ashe or eBay should work. The best way to find a saxophone that's right for you is to go to a saxophone warehouse where you can try them out to see which is best for you. You'll also need the following accessories, if they don't already come with the instrument:    A mouthpiece Don't buy the cheapest one available, but don't splurge on a professional one yet, especially if you may not even stick with the instrument. You'll probably want one made of plastic or hard rubber. Claude Lakey 6*3 Original, Meyer 5, Selmer C* and S-90 series are still popular with instructors and all levels of players from beginners to professionals. Many other brands offer good beginner mouthpieces as well. The Yamaha 4C is also popular. Generally, a good hard rubber mouthpiece will run around $100-150 US. When starting off don't worry about getting a good mouthpiece, a decent student model will suffice. Metal mouthpieces are not suggested for beginners. The worst mistake a beginner can make is to buy an expensive mouthpiece because of advertising, including endorsements by the pros. Preference in mouthpieces is very personal. What a professional like Dave Koz uses might not be suitable for a beginner or novice player. Unfortunately, you just have to try a bunch to find something you like and metal mouthpieces are expensive! To find the best mouthpiece for you, do some research. Learn what the shapes and sizes do to the response and sound. Large bore mouthpieces react differently than smaller bore ones. This is easier to understand after you've played both kinds. Some mouthpieces are made to achieve certain tonal qualities, and if you don't know what you are looking for yet, you should look for mouthpieces which do not lean too far into the classical and jazz, or dark and bright genres. Rousseau, Selmer, Vandoren and Meyer all make good products.    A ligature, if not included with the horn/mouthpiece. The ligature is the device that holds the reed to the mouthpiece. A metal one is fine. Some performers prefer the sound of a leather ligature, but these cost more than the metal ones.  Reeds: As a beginner, you'll probably want to experiment with reeds a bit, but start with anything between a 1.5 to a 2.5, which shouldn't be too easy nor too hard to get a sound with and should produce a decent tone. Good brands to start with are Rico and Vandoren.  Neck strap: Alto saxes aren't usually back-breaking, but you'll need something to help support it while you play. Neck straps come in a variety of styles, and you should choose the one that's most comfortable for you.  Swab: A swab is a piece of fabric (often silk) on a long string with a weight on the end that is pulled through the instrument to remove moisture that has ended up in the horn from playing.  Fingering chart: A fingering chart shows how to play all the notes in the range of the instrument, and you'll want to have one when learning to play.  Method book(s): While not required by any means, if you're learning on your own or would like some extra help, they are an excellent investment.; , Attach the neck (the short, slightly curved piece that's angled wider than 45') to the top of the body of the instrument (the part with all the keys), which is the smaller end of the body and secure with the neck screw which is right next to the top of the body. Remember that your octave key (the long triangular thing along the top of the neck) is sensitive; take care when assembling the neck. Place the wooden reed on the mouthpiece so you can see a very tiny bit of the mouthpiece showing up top. Place the ligature (the small, open metal cylinder) with the screws on the side on the mouthpiece over the reed. If it doesn't seem to fit, turn it upside down and try again. You should be able to see the screws when you're putting it on. Attach your neck strap to the loop on the back of the instrument, put it around your neck, and stand up., Your left hand should be on the top and your right hand should be on the bottom. Your right thumb goes under the curved thumb rest towards the bottom of the instrument. Your right index, middle, and ring fingers go on the mother of pearl keys that should be easy to find. Your pinky will move the other keys at the bottom of the sax. Your left thumb should go on the round piece at the top of the instrument. You will see five mother of pearl keys at the top. Your index finger goes on the second one down, and your middle and ring fingers go on the fourth and fifth, respectively.  There are many different variations of embouchure. Beginners are sometimes taught to curl both lips over their teeth (like grandpa). Most people curl their lower lip over their bottom teeth slightly, and rest their top teeth on the top of the mouthpiece. Some people even press firmly with their lips without curling them over their teeth. Each method produces different tone quality. Play around with what works for you. It's important to make a good, firm seal around the mouthpiece, so that when you blow the air goes through the instrument and not out the corners of your mouth. However, the embouchure does not have to be extremely tight.  If you've done this right, you'll hear a C# (concert E). If you're not getting a sound or you're making a squeaking noise, adjust your embouchure until the tone improves. You may need to put more or less of the mouthpiece inside your mouth. You can also try playing just the mouthpiece: it's sometimes easier to make your first sound with just the mouthpiece. Then just do the same thing with the mouthpiece on the neck!  ,   Press the second mother of pearl key down with your left middle finger, leaving the others uncovered. This produces a C (concert Eb). Press the first mother of pearl key down with your left index finger. This produces a B (concert D). Press down the first and second mother of pearl keys. This produces an A (concert C). Continue covering more holes, going down the scale. Three covered is a G, four is an F, five is an E, and six is a D (concert pitches Bb, Ab, G, and F). You may have a little trouble with the lower notes at first, but it'll improve with practice. Add the octave key (the metal key above your left thumb) to any of these fingerings to produce the same note, but an octave higher. With the help of a fingering chart, move on to altissimo (really high) and really low notes in the range, as well as flat and sharp notes. In time, you will be able to play every note your saxophone can reach from bottom Bb up to top F#.  If you're learning for a school band, you'll definitely get something to learn from there. Otherwise, visit a music store to buy sheet music and/or method books to begin to play from. Once you get more advanced, it's fun to buy books with pop songs that you recognise, or to play along with a CD.  With a lot of hard work and dedication, you'll get better and better at playing. You can branch out into all kinds of specific types of music, especially jazz.	Get an alto saxophone and the accessories necessary to play it. Assemble the saxophone. Make sure you're holding the instrument correctly. Form your embouchure. Without covering any holes or pressing any keys, blow into the instrument. Move on to the next notes. Find some music to play. Keep practicing.
Test gold with a magnet. Gold does not have magnetic properties. Test gold with a fine steel file. Gold is easy to file, but the file will bounce off of other metals. Purchase acids for testing. Follow the instructions on the package to test the gold for genuineness, testing in an inconspicuous spot to prevent visible damage.  You can find the daily market prices of gold on many brokerage websites.  You will need to purchase a jeweler’s scale that weighs gold according to pennyweight (1/12 of a troy ounce) rather than simply weighing gold in grams.  Many customers are happy to sell their gold jewelry and coins to a respectable dealer.  Many dealers at a trade show will give a price break to someone who is just getting started in the business.  Large volume purchases tend to have a lower price per ounce.	Learn to test the quality of gold. Follow market prices. Obtain a scale. Buy gold from customers. Purchase gold at trade shows. Purchase gold in large volumes.
You can find them in shades of red, pink or orange, as well as white. They may also be a combination of a few colors.   The larger the bulb, the more flowers the amaryllis will have.; , Their ideal storage temperature is between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (4 and 10 degrees Celsius).Use your refrigerator’s crisper drawer to store your bulbs for a minimum of 6 weeks. However, you should not store the bulbs next to fruit, like apples, or they can sterilize.  This will depend greatly on your climate. If you have cold temperatures, below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) in the winter, you will need to plant the bulb in a pot and keep it inside.   Winter blooms are generally bigger and last longer than summer blooms. You can plant during both seasons, as long as there is 6 weeks of cold storage between the last bloom dying and the replanting.,, Do not use pots without holes in the bottom. Amaryllis bulbs are very sensitive to overwatering.   Amaryllis prefers to be pot bound, although it can be planted in some smaller garden beds. Plant in the garden bed when temperatures are above 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) and there is no risk of a bad frost. Use the same instructions as you would to plant in a pot., There should be able 2 inches of soil between the side of the bulb and the pot. Most amaryllis bulbs prefer a sturdy 6 to 8 inch pot.,, You can buy pre-made mixes that will work well for this type of flower. Only garden soil will not work, because it will not drain adequately.  Gently fill in potting soil around the bulb. Leave the stem of the bulb, approximately 1/3 of the plant, above the soil.   Don’t pack the soil in too much, since you want the roots to remain intact. If you worry that planting them with the stem above the soil in a garden may force them to fall over, place a planting stake next to the bulb to keep it upright.  It grows best in 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) weather. ,, They should bloom for approximately 2 weeks. The blooms will last longer in a 65-degree temperature (18.3 Celsius) than a hotter temperature.  Add liquid houseplant fertilizer at regular intervals.  When the flower stem wilts, cut it off where it meets the bulb. You can maintain the plant as a green plant for several weeks or months. ,,, Be gentle to avoid harming the bulb.  Dry it and store it in a cool dry place, just as you did before you planted the bulb. It should be kept cool and dry for 6 to 8 weeks before you plant it again.	Purchase Amaryllis bulbs in the color of your choice. Store the bulbs in a cool, dry and well-ventilated place until they are ready to be planted. Decide if you want your amaryllis to bloom in the winter or the summer. Plant the bulb in rich soil outside or in compost soil inside approximately 8 weeks before you want it to flower.  , Choose a container that is well drained. Pick a container that is half as wide as the bulb on each side. Soak the amaryllis bulb in lukewarm water for 2 hours before you intend to plant it.  , Buy rich potting compost at a local garden store. Place the amaryllis bulb in the pot with the roots down. Place the pot in direct sunlight for the first few weeks of care. Water the bulb very sparingly until it reaches 2 inches (5 cm) of new growth.  , Turn the base of the pot every week to encourage straight stalk growth. Move the pot to indirect sunlight when it starts to bloom. Water the amaryllis flower regularly, as you would most house plants. Cut the flowers off 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bulb when they start to die. Start to water the plant less as you get close to removing the bulb.  , Make sure you remove and store the bulbs before the first frost, and before temperatures reach 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius).  , Cut the leaves back to 2 inches above the bulb.When they start to yellow because of cooler temperatures and less water, they are ready to cut. Remove the bulb and roots from the soil. Clean the bulb with water.
Make sure that the space is big enough to hold your car. It will have to be at least 25% longer than the length of your car. You will also want to check for fire hydrants, yellow edges on sidewalks, or handicap signs as to why the space might be left empty., This will allow other cars behind you to drive around. Pull up next to the car in front of the empty spot. You want to be as close to the other car as possible, not more than 12 inches (30.5 cm) away. Ensure that the front of your car is the same distance from the car next to you as the back of your car (don't slant your car at an angle). Your bumper should line up directly parallel to the car next to you., Start backing up slowly until your head is parallel with the wheel of the car to your right. Press on the brake and hold your car steady. Turn your steering wheel as far as it will go clockwise. Look over your left shoulder as far as you can and start backing up again. Keep backing up until you can see the front wheel of the car behind you in your right mirror.Your car should now be positioned at a 45 degree angle into the parking space. Press on your brake and steady your car.  Do this while maintaining your foot on the brake. When it has moved as far as it will go, begin backing up again slowly. Glance from front to back to ensure that you are not going to bump the car in front or the car in back., If you either bump into the curb, or get too close to the car in back of you, turn the top of the wheel to the right again and pull forward slowly. Steer your car into the proper position., Leave space in front and behind to allow yourself and the other people to get out of the parking spots. If you park very far forward or back and another car parks very close to you, you will be too tight to get out of your spot, so don’t forget to leave that space. If done correctly, you should leave no more than 12 inches from the curb to your car.	Find an empty parking spot. Turn your blinker on to the right. Put your car in reverse. Turn your wheel all the way counter-clockwise. Continue to back up until you are parked. Exit your vehicle.
Do they require one piece of cordage?  Or two?  Cobra Weave can be either... but a Fishtail weave requires two pieces... one as base, one as "wrap" or "weave".   Is it a loop over a knot?  A button that must be sewn on?  A snap closure?  Most cobra weaves are a loop over a knot, while the majority of Fishtail wristlets employ a button/loop closure or a clip of some sort.,  Is the surface smoothly wrapped over two center cores? If so, it is most likely a Fishtail Weave,  If so, it is most likely Cobra Weave / Macrame., Fishtail Weave:   Note the smooth, rounded edges formed by wrapping a longer cord over and between two center core cords. Also note the resemblance to the elongated transverse scales seen on the belly of a snake or the tail fin of a fish which inspired the name "Fishtail weave".   This edge is formed by knotting two "outer" cords around the outside of two "inner" cords".	Read through any instructions. Look at the fastening device. Look carefully at the construction. Is the surface a series of square or granny knots tied with a center core of two strands?, Look at the picture to the right. Then check out the next picture... Cobra Weave/ Square Knots/ Macrame:   Note the squarish edges, and the knots which form the bumpy edge.

One of the most important parts of performing a monologue is making sure you have memorized all the lines. Starting your preparations early and practicing the lines often will help you memorize them efficiently.Ask a friend or family member to help you memorize your lines. They can read other characters' lines and even quiz you. Practice your lines twice a day, or more often if you are having trouble memorizing them.; , It is important that you take enough time to warm up before you perform your monologue. This can be as simple as signing some notes to warm up your voice. You can also warm up by going through a few trial runs of the monologue with an acting partner or by yourself.  You should perform a monologue in costume unless it is part of a professional or classroom performance. For most auditions, you should show up in clean, tasteful clothing that does not distract.

If you're not keen on using twigs from the outdoors, use a chopstick instead.  You can use this template if you'd like.  Keep the edges neat.  Use glitter, artificial pearls, and rhinestones, etc., to prettify the star. You can draw designs on it too.  This will help the star to last longer.  Use a strong glue to attach the cardboard star to the top of the twig or chopstick. The thicker the wand stem, the more glue you'll need to use to keep the star in place.  Add some ribbons or tulle bows for embellishment, if desired.  You can now dress up as a witch or warlock and head out to cast spells on your fellow party goers. Keep those spells civil, mind!	Go to the forest and try finding a good twig or stick. Draw a star shape on thin card or cardboard. Cut the star out. Decorate the cardboard star. Coat in Mod Podge if wished. Attach to the twig or chopstick. Allow it to dry fully. Done.
All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.  This will add a little pep to the move. Instead of simply stepping forward, bring your knee up and kick your foot out.   Your knee should come up first, propelling your foot forward a moment later. If you would not be transferring your weight to that foot anyway for this step, just swing it back again without letting it touch the ground. Otherwise, plant it back on the ground after the kick., Instead of simply stepping back after a kick, incorporate a hitch into the movement. Bring your knee back up, so that your upper leg is parallel to the ground, before kicking your foot back again., This adds slightly more difficulty and flare. As your leg swings back and the ball of your foot touches the ground, lean forward and tap the ground with the tips of the fingers of your opposite hand.	Get comfortable with the basic move. Replace a normal step with a kick step. Add a hitch as you move your leg back. Touch the ground with your hand.
If you don’t have yarn available, you can use any thick cotton string. At the location of where you would like the bottle to break, wrap a piece of yarn around the bottle 3-5 times. Tie the ends together and cut off any excess string.  Slide the yarn off the end of the bottle, and place it in a small dish or lid. Pour a bit of nail polish remover or straight-up acetone over the yarn until it is completely soaked. You can pour the excess acetone back into the bottle afterwards.  Take the yarn and replace it back on the bottle in the exact location you want it to break. Try to make sure that the loops of yarn are placed close together and are tight so that you get a level, clean break.  Use a match or a lighter to catch the yarn (on the bottle) on fire. Rotate the bottle slowly so that the yarn burns at a consistent speed around the entire bottle.  Have your sink or a pot filled with cold water - you can add ice as well if you would like. Wait until the fire on the yarn has burnt out, and then stick the end of the bottle with the yarn directly into the water. The bottle should break cleanly off where the yarn was wrapped around it.  Use a rough sandpaper to smooth down the jagged edges on the broken section of the bottle. When you have removed any sharp corners, switch to a fine grit sandpaper to give the bottle a smooth, soft finish. You’re done!	Wrap your yarn. Soak the yarn in acetone. Wrap the bottle again. Light the yarn on fire. Dunk the bottle in cold water. Sand the edges.
This is a slightly "thicker," higher-pitched D chord. It is also much easier to get to when you're further down the neck, and easily transitions into other barre chords.   If you already know it, this is simply an A-major barre chord located on the 5th fret, 5th string. This note is a D.  Barre from the 1st to the 5th string with your index finger. Strum once to ensure that all of the strings are properly pressed down.  You can also place your pinkie on the 2nd string, seventh fret, your ring finger on the 3rd string, 7th fret and your middle finger on the 4th string, 7th fret. Most people find it easier to just barre the string, but you will get a cleaner sound with individual fingers.   If you slid the entire thing up the neck, using open strings instead of a barred index finger, you'd have an open A chord.  The top and bottom strings are the least essential for your chord. If you can strum just the middle four strings, you'll have a better-sounding chord, but you can also strum the high-e string for a little more noise.   Do not strum the top string.	Go to the fifth fret of the guitar. Bar the 5th fret with your index finger, getting all but the top string. Use your ring finger to barre the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings at the 7th fret. Leave the bottom string barred, or simply don't play it.

Installing the new batteries incorrectly, or using the wrong type, will cause your smoke detector to not function. Always make sure you are using the correct type of battery and installing the batteries correctly to ensure the detector will work.   Detectors that use lithium batteries will last for ten years. You generally cannot replace the battery, instead, replace the entire detector after its ten year life span is expired. Many detectors will make use of a 9v battery. However, some may require different types of batteries. Use high quality, long lasting batteries. Using rechargeable or low quality batteries may cause your smoke detectors to fail.; , You will have to take your smoke detector down from its mounting on the ceiling. If your detector is hard-wired into your house's power system, you should turn the power off at the fuse box first.   The method you use to remove your smoke detector from its mounting will vary depending on which model it is. Most smoke detectors are removed by twisting or sliding the detector away from the mounting. Some detectors will not require you remove the entire detector. These models require that you remove only the section that covers the internal components and battery. Not all hard-wired smoke detectors will have a backup battery.  To access the battery, you will have to remove the cover that contains it. Exactly where the battery is located, and how it is secured, will vary from model to model. Generally, once you remove the cover of the detector, you will be able to see where the battery is located without trouble.   The location of this cover will vary from model to model, and some may be secured with a screw or other fastening. Most coverings will slide off and away from the smoke detector's body. Once open, you can remove the old battery or batteries. Make sure you install the new batteries correctly. Check that the negative and positive connections are matching the labels on the smoke detector Close the battery cover. Check your manual for the smoke detector if you are having trouble locating or removing the battery. If you don't have the physical copy of the manual, you may be able to find it online, at the manufacturers website.  Before you reinstall the smoke detector, you will want to make sure that the batteries are working properly. Locate and utilize the button on your smoke detector that will test the batteries.   The location of the test button will vary. Most test buttons require you to press the button for a few seconds to engage the test. If successful, the alarm will sound.  If the alarm doesn't sound during the test of the batteries, you will need to recheck them. Never reinstall your smoke detector until it passes this battery test and has demonstrated that it is functioning properly.Check to see if the batteries are installed correctly. Make sure the positive and negative terminals are matching the correct terminals in the smoke detector. If the batteries are installed correctly, and the test failed, replace the batteries and try again with new ones. If no new batteries are working, your detector may need replacing. You may want to contact the manufacturer, as they may replace the detector if it is under warranty. Some alarms have an LED-light that will indicate if the alarm is working properly. Generally a green light indicates that the alarm is working properly, a red light indicates an issue.  If you still have the manual, review the information to help you better understand your model of smoke detector and to properly maintain its functionality.   Finding where the battery is located, and how to access it, can vary from model to model. The manual may also indicate which type of battery is required by your smoke detector. Don't throw the manual away. Keep it in a place that you can store it safely and still access it when needed.  Wired smoke detectors are connected directly into the power supply of your house, which is sometimes also called the mains.The battery in these detectors is intended to power the alarm in the event of a power outage. To cut power to your wired smoke detector, you'll have to press the circuit breaker in your home circuit box. This should turn turn the circuit from "ON" to "OFF."   Many homes with hard wired circuit breakers will have a breaker specifically labeled for smoke alarms. However, if you do not have a labeled breaker and cannot determine which circuit your detector is on, you can press the main breaker to cut all power to your house, including the smoke alarm. Wired smoke detectors frequently have a small green light that indicates it is receiving power from the mains. When this light turns off, you know the power to the alarm circuit has been cut. Cutting the power to your wired smoke alarm might seem excessive, but this extra precaution will prevent accidental shocks. This can be especially important when dealing with old or excessively dirty smoke detectors.  Depending on the kind of smoke detector in your home, there are many different ways you might have to remove the cover for your detector. These covers are relatively simple, so through trial and error you should be able to get the cover off in less than a few minutes, though a manual might speed this process. Some common covers include:   Push-lock covers. These covers usually have a small, plastic lock that can only be opened by pushing on a specific point indicated on your fire alarm. Look for an arrow indicating the point you need to push, and use a thin screwdriver or pen to release the push-lock. Twist-lock covers. To unfasten these you'll have to twist the cover (usually counterclockwise), or in some cases, push upwards and twist. Hold the alarm as you remove this kind of cover. Once the lock is undone, the cover will fall downwards. Friction-lock covers. These covers are held in place by the friction of a plastic locking mechanism on the inside of your detector. These can often be popped loose by prying the cover free with your fingers using firm, moderate-light pressure., Generally, most smoke detectors use a 9-volt battery for power, though you should always follow the directions that came in your smoke detector manual. Be sure the battery is new so that it lasts the full ten-year life expectancy of most home smoke detectors.You may want to take a felt tipped marker and use it to write the date you replaced the battery on the inside of the cover. This way, if you forget when you last replaced the battery, you can easily find out by checking the inside of your cover.  Use the opposite procedure you used to remove your smoke detector cover to fit it back into place. This will likely involve either twisting the cover clockwise or pressing it until the friction/push locks snap into place. Then you should return power to the circuit by pressing the same breaker you initially pressed to cut power. Once the cover is on, follow your smoke detector user manual to test your battery.   Most smoke detectors have a button on the center of the cover. In many cases, to test your smoke detector, all you need to do is press this button for five seconds. You should hear a chirping noise if your battery is good and properly installed. If you find that, no matter how you fit your battery into place inside your smoke detector, the detector still will not give a test-chirp, try another battery. If this battery does not work, you may need to install a new smoke detector., By installing a smoke detector and keeping it in working order, you will greatly increase your chances of saving your property and life in the event of a fire. By not having a functioning smoke detector, you are taking an unnecessary risk.You increase your chances of property loss by 57% by not having a working smoke detector. Chances of injury increase by 26% if your smoke detector isn't functioning. By not having a smoke detector installed, you are four times more likely to die in a fire. Smoke alarms are not present in three out of five house fire deaths. A properly working smoke alarm will reduce the chance of death in a house fire by 50%.  There are two main types of smoke detector, both of which detect fires using different methods. It is recommended that you install both types in your home or find a model that functions as both in one.The two types of smoke detectors are photoelectric and ionization based detectors. Photoelectric detectors use light to detect smoke, while ionization detectors utilize radiation sensors to register smoke.Some smoke detectors combine both photoelectric and ionization into one detector. There are special smoke alarms for the hearing impaired. These generally use a bright, flashing strobe light instead of an audible alarm. Certain smoke detectors can communicate with each other. If one is triggered, all detectors will sound their alarms.  A smoke detector is a great investment, and many types of smoke detectors are affordable. If you need to replace old detectors, or install new ones, knowing the price ahead of time can help you budget properly for a detector.Ionization or photoelectric based detectors usually start at around $6. Models that include both ionization an photoelectric in one start at $24. Some detectors come with a microprocessor, for better and faster detection, and start at $30. Wireless smoke detectors start at $40.  You may have smoke detectors installed in your home, however, they may not be placed in ideal locations. Strategically installing your smoke detectors will increase their functionality, allowing them to alert you sooner in the event of a fire.   Install at least one smoke detector per floor in your home.Bedrooms should have their own smoke detector installed. Any hallways that lead to bedrooms should also have their own detector installed. Most smoke detectors should be placed on the ceiling, as smoke rises. If this isn't an option, place the detector as high up on your wall as you can. Any directly wired smoke detector should be installed by a professional electrician to avoid improper installation.  Having a smoke detector installed is only the first step in fire safety. You will need to properly maintain your smoke detector in order to make sure you are protected by it. Perform regular checks and replacement of batteries to ensure your protection.For any standard 9v battery powered detector, test monthly, replace the battery yearly, and replace the detector every ten years. For a long-life battery detector, test the alarm monthly and replace the detector according to your manufacturer's instruction. Most of these are built to last for ten years. For a detector that is directly wired into your homes electrical system, test it monthly and replace the detector every ten years. Replace the backup battery at least once a year. Dust or vacuum your smoke detectors to keep them functioning at their best.	Check the battery type. Remove the smoke detector. Open the battery compartment and install the new battery. Test the batteries. Double check if the test fails. Review your smoke detector's instruction manual. Turn off power to your wired smoke detector. Remove the cover of your smoke detector. Replace the battery. Reattach the cover and test your smoke detector. Install a smoke detector to protect your property and life. Learn about the different types of smoke detectors. Know the cost of smoke detectors. Learn where to place smoke detectors. Maintain your smoke detector.
Place drop cloths on the floor, and open any windows and doors to allow plenty of ventilation into the area. Position the wood furniture that is to be painted on the cloths. Put on a face mask, and possibly gloves, before beginning the project.       ; , Maybe you're renovating a chest of drawers, or a dresser; in that case, you want to remove any hardware that's attached to the furniture before you paint it. This does two things:          It ensures that the hardware is paint-free when you reattach it, and that the entire piece will be adequately covered with paint if you decide that you want use different hardware.  Apply most of the wood filler to the damaged part of the wood, not to the undamaged wood, although there can be some overlap (and you'll be able to sand it down later). Use the putty knife to scrape away excess wood filler and allow it to dry.          If you're going to replacing any hardware on your furniture, fill in the old holes where the previous hardware was attached. Scape flush to the board with a putty knife and let dry.  This can be managed by using a piece of sandpaper with a sandpaper block, or by using a hand sander for larger pieces. The goal is to remove any protective varnish or lacquer that is on the surface of the wood, making it easier for the primer coat to adhere.          Pay close attention to any scroll work or other indentations in the wood, making sure to sand those by hand as thoroughly as possible. Pay special attention to the areas where wood filler was applied. Sand enough so that the filled portions are flush with the rest of the furniture.  Wiping gently with a clean tack cloth will help remove the residue and leave the clean surface. If necessary, use a mild detergent and wipe the wood surface dry with the cloth.	Prepare the area for the painting project. Remove any necessary hardware from the furniture. Patch any chipped, holed, or pitted surfaces with wood filler. Sandpaper the surface of the furniture. Remove any residue left after sanding the furniture surface.
Choose moves that flow easily into one another. Use the notes that you have compiled while watching dances in your genre and by free dancing.For example, if you're doing a dance that requires you to lean forward and shake your hips, you should transition into another move that requires you to shake your hips. Maybe instead of leaning forward you lean all the way backward. Those two moves have now been paired together and can be incorporated into your dance.  Common dance moves like the Twist for rock and roll music or the the two step and arm wave for hip hop can help you start to figure out what kind of dance you want to move.   The twist involves standing with your feet shoulder length apart and then proceeding to twist your hips while you shift your weight from one foot to another. Hold your arms away from your body. It's a great starting point for older rock and roll songs. If you're trying to make up a hip hop dance, two step is a great options. The two step is easy, you bend over slightly with one foot forward and one foot back. You take one step forward from a low position and rock up, then step back and rock back. It's basically an exaggerated walking in place motion. The arm wave is another good hip hop dance move. To do the arm wave you put both your arms out straight to the side, then lift your hand at the wrist while you keep the rest of your shoulders and arms level. Then let your hand drop and lift just your wrist. As you do this you want your fingertips to be roughly in the same line as your shoulder. When you lift your elbow it raises while your hand shoulder stay down. After this you move to your other shoulder - as the shoulder drops the elbow comes up, then your other wrist comes up, followed by your other hand. It might be easier to visualize rolling a ball from one hand to another. You do the same motion.  Dividing the song into sections will help you remember your dance moves, but it will also help you come up with a better idea for what sort of dance you should be doing at each point of the song.   For example, if the song starts slow your dance should reflect that. Once the song starts to pick up speed, you could designate that as a different section and dance differently during that period of time.  If you already know where you’re going to be dancing when you perform, consider placing down pieces of tape that designate the areas you need to be at certain points in your dance. Blocking is a word used in theater that indicates the location the actor is supposed to be on the stage. If you are dancing with many different people you can use different colors of tape for each person.   Take your event and audience into consideration when you’re blocking your dance.  Just make sure that you are organized and clear enough that you are able to remember what means what.   Writing out your routine will help you make it clearer in your mind and you’ll also start to notice things like inconsistencies in the dance or if there are parts with too much repetition.  Make sure your dance matches your music and the mood you want to convey. Slower dances may be more emotional and introspective, whereas if you are moving your hips quickly and moving around with faster motions you might bring a higher energy to the dance. Consider what you want to accomplish with your dance.	Start to pair moves together. Incorporate common moves. Match your moves to different sections of the song. Begin blocking your dance. Write out your routine.It’s perfectly fine to use your own shorthand, since you’re going to be the only one explaining the routine to other people anyways. Convey a mood with your dance.
If it has a rough surface, you will need to sand it first with a medium (80-grit) sandpaper until the edges are even. Employ a power sander for faster results.   Fill in any holes with lacquer filler. Regular brands of filler will not be compatible with the chemicals in lacquer.; , The sanding will create a smooth surface but also help the primer to stick to the surface of your wood.  Remove all debris before continuing. Vacuum the entire area with a shop-vac to remove excess dust before you start your finishing process.  Choose a very well ventilated place to apply your lacquer. Many types of lacquer are toxic and flammable.  It will help the lacquer to stick more easily to the surface. If your wood has a very rough finish, do two coats of lacquer primer. Dry according to package directions in between coats.  Aerosol lacquer is the best product to use the first time you try the method because it can be applied uniformly.   If you must apply liquid lacquer, use a wide natural bristle brush. Practice on another piece of wood before you finish your piece of furniture. , Wipe it with a tack cloth before applying your lacquer.  Hold the can between 10 and 18 inches from the surface of the furniture. Spray it in small horizontal strokes.   If the surface starts to dimple, like an orange peel, you are holding the can too far away. If the surface starts to streak, you are holding it too close. It may take a few practice strokes to find the ideal distance for your climate and furniture.  It will take a half hour or less to dry, but 48 hours to cure. Let each coat cure before you apply another layer.  Wipe with a tack cloth.  Let it cure.  Apply a third coat of lacquer and let it cure for 48 hours. Lacquer is thinner than other finishes and requires more coats.  0000 steel wool. Wipe with a tack cloth, and then apply paste wax to the surface. Buff the surface with a lint-free cloth.	Choose the piece of furniture that you want to lacquer. Sand the surface again with extra fine (120-grit) sandpaper. Wipe the furniture thoroughly with tack cloths. Set down clean drop cloths. Purchase a lacquer base/primer. Buy cans of colored lacquer spray. Wear a mask, safety goggles and gloves when you apply all paint and lacquer.  , Sand the surface of the primer with fine-grit sandpaper. Shake the can according to package directions. Cover the entire surface with a coat of lacquer. Sand the surface lightly again, with fine-grit sandpaper. Apply a second coat of lacquer. Sand and wipe the surface. Finish by buffing the surface of the furniture with No.
This lamp uses a jar and a bit of wire. It's great for those who have jars but either don't have the lid anymore or don't want to poke a hole in the lid. Here's a list of what you will need to make this lamp:   Squat mason jar 100% cotton cord or lamp wick Olive oil Scissors Floral wire Wire cutters  , The thicker wick you use, the larger flame you will get. If you want something small, go for a #2 or ¼ inch lantern wick., The wire needs to be long enough so that it can hook over the mouth of the jar when doubled. You will be using it to support your wick.   Avoid using plastic-coated, painted, copper, or zinc/galvanized wire.Do not use scissors. Not only could you hurt yourself, but you'll also dull the scissors.  You are sandwiching the wick between the two halves of the wire. The tip of the wick should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) above the lip of the wire.  The wire needs to be tight enough so that it can suspend the wick, but loose enough so that you can still pull the wick up and down.  It's okay if the wick dips down a little bit into the jar. If it dips down too far into the jar, try bringing it a little bit closer to the rim.  The wire should now be holding the wick just inside the mouth of the jar. If the wire does not hold its shape, you can try wrapping another piece of wire around the neck of the jar, securing the wick-holding-wire to the jar.  Olive oil is great to use because it doesn't contain dangerous chemicals. It also burns clean and doesn't stink.  This will give the wick enough time to soak up the oil and allow you to light it.	Gather your supplies. Trim the wick down with a pair of scissors so that it can fit inside the jar. Cut a piece of thin wire using wire cutters. Place the wick in the center of your wire and fold the wire in half. Gently twist the two halves of the wire together. Position your wick over the center of the jar. Hook the end of the wire over the lip of the jar. Fill the jar about two-thirds to three-fourths of the way with olive oil. Wait 15 minutes before lighting your wick.
Do you want her dirty blonde and black look, or her platinum blonde look?; , Avril is always seen with long hair. If you have long hair, keep it a few inches above your waist, with very few layers at the bottom of your hair. If you have short hair, grow it out long.  If you're going for the black and dirty blonde look, separate your hair into two parts; top and bottom. Dye the bottom part black and the top part almost a dirty blonde. For the platinum blonde look, dye your whole head platinum blonde, except for the front where you can put pink and green in it. If you wanted to be a little different, instead of dying it pink and green, dye the hair your two favorite colors.  Don't copy Avril's hair to a tee, make it your own. If your want to get some funky layers, or different highlights, do by all means.	Decide which Avril look you're going for. Whichever look you're going for, get long hair. Dye your hair. Be unique.
Especially if this is your first time driving a car with a manual transmission, start slowly and methodically. Put your seat belt on once you sit down. While learning, it can be useful to roll down the windows. This helps you hear the sound of the engine revving and to shift gears accordingly.The pedal on the left is the clutch, the middle one is the brake, and the accelerator is on the right (remember it, from left to right, as C-B-A). This layout is the same for both left-hand drive and right-hand drive vehicles.; , Before you start pushing down on this unfamiliar pedal on the left, take a moment to figure out the basics of it's function.The clutch disengages the engine from the wheels. When one or both are spinning, the clutch allows you to switch gears without grinding the teeth of each separate gear. Before you change gears (either to move up or down), the clutch must be depressed (pushed).  Slide forward enough to allow you to press the clutch pedal (the left pedal, next to the brake pedal) fully to the floor with your left foot., This would also be a good time to take note of how the travel of the clutch pedal differs from that of the brake and gas. It’s also a good opportunity to get used to slowly and steadily releasing the clutch pedal.If you’ve only ever driven automatic cars, it might feel awkward to use your left foot to push a pedal. With practice, you’ll get used to using both feet in concert.  This is the middle position that feels free when moved from side to side. The vehicle is considered out of gear when:The gearstick is in the neutral position, and/or The clutch pedal is fully depressed. Don’t try to use the gearstick without having the clutch pedal depressed, because it simply won't work.  Make sure the handbrake is on before starting the car, especially if you are a novice.Some cars will start up in neutral without the clutch depressed, but some newer cars will not.  If you’re on level ground, you should remain stationary; you’ll start rolling if you’re on a hill. If you’re ready to move on to actually driving, make sure to release the handbrake (if it’s engaged) before you drive off., It should be the upper-left position, and there should be some kind of visual layout of the gear pattern on top of the gearstick.Gear patterns can vary, so take some time beforehand to study your car’s gear layout. You may want to practice shifting through the various gears with the engine switched off (and the clutch engaged).  Continue until you hear the engine speed begin to drop, then push it back in. Repeat this several times until you can instantly recognize the sound. This is the friction point.When you’re shifting gears to start or keep moving, this is the point at which you’ll want to have the accelerator depressed enough to provide power.  In order to get moving, lift your left foot up from the clutch pedal until the RPMs drop slightly. At the same instant, apply light pressure to the accelerator with your right foot. Balance the light downward pressure on the accelerator with slowly releasing pressure on the clutch pedal. You will probably have to do this several times to find the right combination of up and down pressure.Another way of doing it; is to release the clutch until the point the engine revs down a little, and then applying pressure on the accelerator as the clutch engages. At this point the car will start to move. It is best to have the engine rev just enough to prevent stalling as the clutch pedal is let up. This process may be a little difficult at first because you are new to the extra pedal in a manual car. Release the clutch fully (that is, slowly remove your foot from the pedal) once you start moving forward under control in first gear.  If you release the clutch too quickly the engine will stall. If the engine sounds like it is going to stall, hold the clutch where it is or push down a bit further. If you do stall, depress the clutch fully, apply the handbrake, put the car in neutral, switch the engine off and restart the car as normal. Don’t panic.Revving the engine while the clutch is between fully up and fully depressed will wear out the clutch parts prematurely, resulting in slippage or smoking of the clutch parts at the transmission. This is called riding the clutch and should be avoided.  When your RPM reaches about 2500 to 3000 while the car is in motion, it is time to shift to the next gear — for example, second gear if you are currently in first. The actual RPMs at which shifting is required will vary by the car you are driving, however. Your engine will begin to race and speed up, and you must learn to recognize this noise.Depress the clutch pedal until it disengages and guide the gearstick straight down from first gear into the bottom-left position (which is second gear in most configurations). Some cars have a "Shift Light" or indications on the tachometer that will tell you when you need to shift, so you don't rev the engine too fast.  Shifting gears in motion is the same as shifting into first from a stationary position. It’s all about listening, looking, and feeling for the engine’s cues and getting the up-and-down timing of your feet on the pedals correct. Keep practicing and you’ll get the hang of it.Once in gear and on the accelerator, you should completely remove your foot from the clutch pedal. Resting your foot on the clutch pedal is a bad habit, as it applies pressure to the clutch mechanism — and the increased pressure will cause the clutch to wear out prematurely.  If you are going too slow for the current gear you’re in, your car will shudder as if it’s about to stall. To shift down gears while in motion, follow the same process of depressing the clutch and releasing the accelerator, shifting gears (say, from third to second), and letting off the clutch while depressing the accelerator., To come to a stop in a fully controlled manner, shift down gradually until you reach first gear. When it’s time to come to a complete stop, move your right foot from the accelerator to the brake pedal and press down as much as is required. As you slow to about 10 mph (16 km/h), the car will be on the verge of shaking and vibrating. Press the clutch pedal fully down and move the gearstick into neutral to prevent stalling the car. Use the brake pedal to stop completely.You can also stop while in any gear by depressing the clutch fully and using the brake while shifting into neutral. This should only be done when you need to stop quickly, though, as it puts you in less control of the vehicle.  While you can legally practice alone on any public road with a valid driver’s license, you will pick up the nuances of driving a manual car faster if you have an experienced driver accompanying you Start off in a flat, isolated area like a large (and empty) car park, then move on to quiet suburban streets. Drive around the same circuit repeatedly until you start to remember the various skills involved., When you’re new to driving a manual, plan routes that avoid traffic lights at the top of steep hills. Your timing and coordination in working the gear stick, clutch, brake, and accelerator needs to be fairly sharp in order to avoid drifting backwards when you shift into first gear.You need to be able to quickly (but smoothly) move your right foot from releasing the brake to depressing the accelerator, while at the same time letting out the clutch. You can use the parking brake to limit backward drifting if necessary, but always remember to disengage it as you start moving forward.  Unlike automatics, manual transmission cars don’t have a “park” gear. But, simply putting the car in neutral opens the possibility of your car rolling freely, especially if parked on an incline or decline. Always use the handbrake, but don’t rely on it alone to keep your car in place whilst parked.If you are parked facing uphill, shut the car off in neutral, then shift into first gear and apply the parking brake. If facing downhill, do the same but shift into reverse. This will prevent the wheels from rolling in the direction of the slope. On extreme inclines, or simply to be extra cautious, you can also place chocks (angled blocks) behind your wheels to prevent movement.  Making a complete stop when changing directions is an easy way to reduce your likelihood of causing expensive damage to your gearbox.It is strongly recommended to stop completely before going from reverse to first gear. However, it is possible on most manual transmissions to shift into first or possibly second when the car is moving backwards at a slow speed, but it is not recommended as this can cause excessive wear on the clutch. In some cars, reverse gear has a lock out mechanism to prevent you for engaging it accidentally. Before using the reverse gear, make sure you know about this locking mechanism and how to disengage it before selecting reverse.	Start on level ground with the car off. Learn what the clutch does. Adjust the seat position so you can access the clutch pedal’s full range of motion. Press the clutch pedal and hold it to the floor. Move the gearstick into neutral. Start the engine with the key in the ignition, making sure the gear stick is still in neutral. Remove your foot from the clutch pedal with the car still in neutral. Press the clutch to the floor and move the gearstick into first gear. Slowly lift your foot up from the clutch pedal. Let up on the clutch while pushing down on the accelerator. Expect to stall at least a few times when you’re first starting out. Recognize when it’s time to shift up to a higher gear. Push down on the accelerator very slightly and slowly release the clutch pedal. Shift down into a lower gear as you slow down. Come to a complete stop. Practice on an easy course with an experienced manual driver. Avoid stopping and starting on steep hills initially. Learn parking procedures, especially on hills. Stop completely before changing from forward to reverse (and vice versa).
It does not matter which side you part your hair on, as long as you made the part deep. It should be level with your eyebrow.This style will be easier with longer hair, but you can attempt it if you have short hair.  Gather some hair from the thicker side of the part. It should be perpendicular to the part, not parallel to it. Split it into three sections. Each one should be no thicker than your finger., Cross the front strand under the middle one, then cross the back strand under the middle one. This will be the start of your Dutch braid. It is very important that you cross the left and right strands under the middle one and not over, otherwise you'll get a French braid instead., Gather some hair from your hairline, and add it to the front section. Cross the front section under the middle one. Gather some hair from just behind the back section. Add it to the back section, then cross it under the middle one.Keep the braid about an inch (2.54 centimeters) from your hairline.  When you reach the nape of your neck, brush your hair back to hide the part, then continue adding it into the braid as before. Braid across the back of your head, then stop., Pull all the hair from the other side of your head into the Dutch braid. Finish off with a regular braid. Your braid needs to be long enough to wrap around the side of your head and reach just past the part.If you hair isn't long enough for this, continue Dutch braiding until you reach the part, then finish off with a regular braid.  Keep the braid right against the inside edge of the Dutch braid. Tuck the tail-end of the braid underneath the braid, then secure everything with bobby pins.Use bobby pins that match your hair color. Depending on your hair length, you may have to wrap the braid a few times around your head. This is perfectly fine; Leia herself had very long hair!  , You are now ready to brave the cold and save your friends from AT-ATs and wampas.	Brush your hair and create a deep side part. Split the hair at your hairline into three sections. Braid for two stitches. Begin to Dutch braid across your forehead. Continue to Dutch braid towards the nape of your neck. Gather the rest of your hair together and do a regular braid. Wrap the braid across the top of your head. Set the style with hairspray.
You're a computer. But what's your purpose? Why are you in a human body? Be adventurous. Keep a mental note of everything you think of.; ,, If you feel you can't answer it, say in a flat voice: "I am sorry, I do not understand." (make sure you don't sound cheeky though)  ,, This takes practice, but it's really effective.  It can be about anything you want, for example, if you like a type of sport, you can research random facts about it.  Do this for an hour and see if they notice. If they do, they're most likely to ask "Are you alright?" or "Why are you talking like that?" Return to your own voice and say "What are you talking about?"  ,, If you're not the kind of person who wants to bother with all that hassle or look like a nerd, then just try a bit harder than you usually do.  It doesn't have to be computers themselves, although that WOULD be the best one to choose.  GLaDOS from the Portal Series, HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey and even Mr Smith from The Sarah Jane Adventures are three great examples to start with.

There are four typical DJ setups:   Computer only        Check out software like: Traktor, VirtualDJ, Ableton, etc. It can be very difficult to DJ with only a computer as you have to remember a number of keyboard shortcuts for things that would normally be intuitive on the other setups but it is a good place to start          Midi Controllers       Controllers may be Midi or USB used for controlling software on a computer which combines more traditional hands on DJing with computer DJing. The controllers usually have control for two virtual decks and a mixer in the middle. Examples: Vestax VCI-300, Numark NS7, Pioneer DDJ-S1          CD Players  To DJ with CDs you will either need two table-top DJ style CD players or a rack mounted dual CD player. DJ CD players are not the same as consumer CD players; they have features like pitch control and jog wheels which are a necessity. You will also need a mixer in your CD setup. CD Player Examples: Pioneer CDJ-400, Denon DN-S3500 Mixer Examples: Pioneer DJM-800, Vestax PMC-05Pro    Vinyl Turntables  Similar to CD players but for records (vinyl). You would need two DJ style turntables and a mixer for a vinyl setup. Turntable Examples: Technics SL-1200, Vestax PDX-3000     A note on turntables and CD players: newer technology allows turntables and CD players to control software on a laptop like a controller. One of the more common interfaces for this purpose is called Serato which is a "DVS" or Digital Vinyl System.; , Before you buy even a single piece of equipment, determine your overall budget. DJ equipment is expensive and only the higher end gear will retain any sort of resale value.   You need to decide if you want to save up for top of the line gear or if you want to start with more affordable entry level equipment. Be aware however that if you opt for the less expensive gear if you ever decide to upgrade it may not have much value if you try to resell it.  If you are new to DJing it is recommended that you visit a couple stores and actually get hands on with the demo equipment. Stores like Guitar Center and Agiprodj have units on the floor that you can play with and knowledgeable staff that can answer questions. Even if you decide to purchase online you should visit a store and look at what you'll be getting first.  Most cities have more than one retailer and there is always the option to purchase online. If you are new to DJing you will likely want to select a retailer with knowledgeable staff that can help you along the way.       You will probably want to buy all of the gear at once as most DJ gear needs a full setup to be useful. (For example, two CD players without a mixer would be impossible to mix on.)       Setup financing only if necessary. A lot of audio retailers have financing options for expensive purchases like DJ equipment but with interest you will pay more than retail so use financing only if you have no other option.  You do not want to pay retail for used gear.       Assess the condition of the gear. Whenever possible you should test the gear, if that is not an option at least inspect for any major defects.	Determine the type of gear you wish to use. Determine your budget. Get hands-on and do some research. Buying New Equipment:  You will have lots of options for buying new. Buying Used Equipment:  Make sure you know the price for new gear before agreeing for a used price.
Lantana benefits from being pruned in the mid-springtime before growth begins. This will improve flowering later in the season.   Avoid pruning in the fall.  Remove any branches that are crowded or grow over other branches. Cut back the Lantana by about a third of the size of the plant.   Give the plant a liquid feed after pruning.  During the growing season you should lightly prune your Lantana, as this will encourage new flowering. Take about two inches off each growing tip with a sharp pair of garden scissors. This should encourage new growth.   It’s always a good idea to feed the plant after pruning.	Prune before growth begins. Remove any dead, damaged or diseased growth. Lightly prune during the growing season.
If you are interested in long scenic trips and highway driving, you will want to look for a touring or a cruiser with a large engine. You will need the power for speed and highway driving. If you are a thrill seeker, a sportier bike is for you. These are light and nimble, and probably a little easier to handle. If off-road racing and hill jumping is your game, then you will want to focus on dirt-bikes.; , The type of the bike you are interested in should make a big difference here. A used dirt bike can sometimes be picked up on the cheap end; a used cruiser however, is still likely going to cost you a little. A new cruiser though, will cost you a significant amount of cash. You need to have an immovable price point though, that you will not cross over, not even by a buck.  Straight line or V-Twin makes a difference in handling and speed and will determine which brand you can purchase.  You need to have 1-3 specific bikes to choose from that you definitely want. If 1 or more is within your price range, this will help you weed out any above that, as well as give you an estimate on what you can expect to pay. At least you have a benchmark at this point.  With new, you will obviously need to go to a dealer; with a used bike, you will have options. In almost all situations, you will probably get the best price on a used bike from a private individual; however, you will get peace of mind from a dealer - to a certain extent. A dealer can offer you a warranty that could help you in the event you have mechanical issues or purchased a lemon. A private individual would likely be cheaper, but you won't exactly be able to return it or have the buyer pay for the repairs.	Reflect on what you want to do with your bike. Pick whether or not you want to go with a new bike or a used one. Determine the specific size and style of engine you want. Research various sources for pricing on the specific brand, make, model and engine size. Decide on new or used if either is within your price range.
If you have concerns that your children may try to eat crayons, try making them from food grade ingredients. These crayons use a blend of carnauba wax and tallow for the base.Use powdered herbs and veggies, and spices to make your colors. Use turmeric for yellow, beetroot powder for pink, and chlorella for green. Once you get the hang of making the crayons, experiment with different combinations to make new colors.You can buy tallow online or in the grocery store, or you can make your own. If you can't find tallow, you can substitute cacao butter, just make sure it is food grade., Add 1 oz of carnauba wax and 1.5 oz of tallow to a double boiler and melt. If you don't have a double boiler, you can melt the waxes together in a stainless steel bowl over a pot of boiling water., When the wax and tallow are melted completely, add in your pigments. Keep the mixture on a low heat as you whisk in your colors.To make pink, use 5 teaspoons of beetroot powder.To make yellow, use 1.25 teaspoons of turmeric.To make orange, use 1.25 teaspoons of ground annatto.Use 1.25 teaspoons of chlorella powder to make a deep green., Use a silicone ice stick mold to form your crayons. You can also use a mold with fun shapes, such as stars or gingerbread men.You may find that some of the mixtures leave a small amount of sludge at the bottom of the pan. This is the result of the powders settling. Discard this part of the mixture. Adding it to your crayon will make the crayons gritty and uneven.Let the crayons set completely before using them. Carnauba wax hardens quickly, so the crayons should only take a few hours to set.	Gather your supplies. Melt the wax and tallow. Mix in your pigments. Pour the colored wax into a mold.
You might be able to pay a lower price than the sticker or asking price by negotiating with the seller. Once you settle on a price, however, that's your starting point.   For example, suppose you negotiate a deal to purchase a new car for $19,055.  You have a down payment and your old car to trade-in, and you qualify for a customer cash rebate.  You plan to finance the rest of the cost with an auto loan. ; ,  Also find out how much your state charges for tax and title fees.  Add this to the cost of the car. Some states don’t allow a deduction of sales tax on trade-ins; you must pay tax on the total cost.   For the example, suppose your state charges 7 percent sales tax and an additional $200 for tags and title fees.     The sales tax would be $19,055∗.07=$1,335{\displaystyle \$19,055*.07=\$1,335}.   The cost of the car would now be $20,590 ($19,055+$1,335+$200=$20,590){\displaystyle (\$19,055+\$1,335+\$200=\$20,590)}.  It may be the case that you're trading in your old vehicle to help pay for the new one. Once you've settled on a trade-in value with the dealership, deduct that amount from the purchase price of the car.   The dealer offers you $3,000 for your trade-in.  This brings the cost of the car down to $17,590 ($20,590−$3,000=$17,590){\displaystyle (\$20,590-\$3,000=\$17,590)}.   Dealer fees vary depending on your state and whether you are purchasing a new or used car.  Destination fees pay for the cost of delivering a new vehicle from the factory to the car dealership.  Documents fees (also known as “doc” fees or conveyance fees) include loan processing fees and service and handling fees.  Some states have caps on documents fees.The dealer charges you $500 in destination and vehicle preparation fees.  This brings the cost of the car to $18,090 ($17,590+$500=$18,090){\displaystyle (\$17,590+\$500=\$18,090)}.   You may qualify for these discounts when purchasing a new car.  Manufacturers and car dealers use them to steer customers away from the competition and ensure brand loyalty.  Research available incentives and rebates ahead of time to potentially save thousands of dollars on a new car.Typical rebates include customer cash for brand loyalty and dealer cash that may be passed along to the customer.   Common incentives include low annual percentage rate (APR) financing for customers with excellent credit and special lease programs.   You qualify for a brand loyalty rebate of $1,000.  The cost of the car is now $17,090 ($18,090−$1,000=$17,090){\displaystyle (\$18,090-\$1,000=\$17,090)}.  The down payment is the amount of cash that you're putting down to pay for the car.This amount will vary from sale to sale and is based on what you can afford to pay out of pocket immediately. Deduct that amount from the amount to be financed.   Your down payment is $2,000.  This brings the total cost of the car down to $15,090 ($17,090−$2,000=$15,090){\displaystyle (\$17,090-\$2,000=\$15,090)}.     The amount you need to finance, or borrow, is $15,090.   Auto loans are what is known as an amortizing loan.  The creditor lends you the principal amount, which is the cost of the car.  You pay the creditor back plus interest.  The principal and interest are paid down (or amortized) in equal payments over the life of the loan.The monthly payments remain the same, but the interest piece of the payment decreases and the principal piece increases over the course of the loan.   The term “amortization” means paying down the loan in equal installments.  The formula will tell you how much each payment will be.  The information you need is the amount of the loan, the interest rate per month and the total number of months that you will make a payment.Use the formula A=P∗(r(1+r)n)/((1+r)n−1){\displaystyle A=P*(r(1+r)^{n})/((1+r)^{n}-1)}.   A = the monthly payment.   P = the principal   r = the interest rate per month, which equals the annual interest rate divided by 12   n = the total number of months   ,  Using the above example, you need to borrow $15,090 to purchase the car.  This is the principal.  You qualify for an auto loan that lasts 4 years, or 48 months and charges 7 percent annual interest.  You will repay the loan (including principal and interest) in 48 equal payments (once per month).   Calculate the interest rate per month.  The annual interest rate is 7 percent. Divide this by 12 to get the monthly interest rate.  The monthly interest rate is 0.583 percent (7/12=.5833){\displaystyle (7/12=.5833)}   A=15,090∗(.00583(1+.00583)48)/(1+.00583)48−1{\displaystyle A=15,090*(.00583(1+.00583)^{48})/(1+.00583)^{48}-1}.   A=15,090∗(.0077/.3218){\displaystyle A=15,090*(.0077/.3218)}.   A=15,090∗.02393=361.07{\displaystyle A=15,090*.02393=361.07}     Your monthly payment will be $361.07   ,  Fortunately, Microsoft Excel offers several handy functions that will perform complicated calculations for you.One of those functions, the PMT function, will calculate your monthly payments based on specifics about your loan., You'll not only need your loan information, but you'll also need to modify them slightly to get the correct value.  Multiply the length of the loan in years by 12. You want to calculate monthly payments, not annual payments, so you'll need the total number of months throughout the life of the loan. For example, if the loan is for four years, then the number of months is 4 * 12, or 48.  Since you want to pay off the loan completely, the future value of the loan will be 0. This means that you won't owe any more money at the end of the payment stream.  Launch Excel and type these words on the first 4 rows in column A:  Rate  Number of Payments  Present Value  Future Value   , Plug the following numbers in column B next to the descriptions:  7.00%  48  15,090  0   , Input the formula “=PMT(B1/12,B2,B3,B4)” in a cell below the numbers.  Type “=PMT(“ and click on the cell with 7.00% so “B1” appears after the left parentheses.   Type “/12,” (including the comma). Remember, you're dividing by 12 because you're calculating the interest rate on a monthly basis and the interest rate you were given is on an annual basis.  Click on the cell with 48 to see “B2” appear.   Type a comma after “B2” and click on the cell with 15,090 to see “B3” appear.  Type a comma after “B3” and click on the cell with 0 to see “B4” appear.    Type a right parenthesis at the end to complete the formula.    , Press the “Enter” key and the formula will be replaced with the monthly payment of $361.35.   Change any of the variables, such as the finance amount or number of months, to see how the monthly payment changes.  If you want to double-check Excel's math or you don't have access to Excel, you can get your loan payment by using one of the many loan payment calculators that are online.

Lay the mulch before planting your garden if you are using inorganic mulch, such as cardboard, paper or plastic.  Use a garden hoe or tiller to turn up the soil of the garden.  Use a garden hose to soak the garden thoroughly with water.    Lay the cardboard, paper or plastic in rows in the garden. Bend and bury the ends of each piece of cardboard, paper or plastic in the ground. Burying the ends of the material will secure the mulch.    Use scissors or a knife to cut holes or slits into the mulch where you will place your plants or seeds in the ground. Use a garden trowel to hollow out areas in the ground beneath the holes or slits for your plants or seeds. Cut extra slits into the mulch to allow water to reach the ground beneath the mulch. Place your plants or seeds into the hollowed-out ground beneath the holes or slits. Cover the seeds or the roots of the plants with dirt. Water the plants or seeds thoroughly.	Time the preparation of mulch. Prepare the ground. Water the garden. Lay the mulch. Add the plants or seeds.

Soil type and drainage will influence how often you need to water your roses. Sandy soil will drain easily and won’t retain water very well. If your garden has clay soil then it will retain moisture better - however, if the soil is very clay-heavy, you’ll need to dig some compost or similar horticultural material to improve it at planting time.; , Obviously plants need watering during hot dry weather. But you should also be aware that wind can dry out plants a great deal, even in cold weather. Newly planted roses may be at risk of drought during a dry, windy fall or winter.   As a rough guide, in extremely hot weather you should assume rose plants will need watering daily. On a standard summer day with decent heat, you will need to water every two or three days, and in warm dry weather you will only need to water about once a week. Also consider how windy it is when deciding how much to water your plants: windy weather means more water is required.  Recently-planted roses still haven’t developed their root structure, so if you’ve planted in the last few months it is especially important to water the roses regularly during dry spells – even if you planted just before winter. Lack of water is the most common reason newly planted plants fail.   Once established, plants will be more adept at seeking water from a wider area of soil, so you can start to ease off your watering regime after six months.  Larger rose bushes will have roots spread over a wider area of soil than smaller ones. This means larger rose bushes will require more water to ensure the water reaches all of their roots.  Another way to assess if roses need watering is to dig a few inches into the soil next to the plant, taking care not to damage the roots. If the soil is dry under the surface, then you need to water the rose now. If only the surface is dry, you can wait a bit longer before watering.  It’s better to give the rose bushes a large amount of water less often, than a small amount of water more often. For example: giving a full watering can of water once a week rather than a quarter can every other day.   This is because it’s better for the plant to develop deep roots in quest of water and it’s also better if the soil isn’t permanently waterlogged. This is an important consideration, especially on clay soils or other poor-draining soils where waterlogging is more likely.  Take a large watering can - if possible, it’s best to use a watering can ‘rose’, which is the showerhead-style spout that stops the water coming out in a single stream.   If you use a single spout can it can erode the soil around the roots. Exposure will eventually damage the roots. Roses will always prefer rainwater but this isn’t essential. If you are using a garden hose, avoid a high-pressure jet as this can also erode the soil from the roots. Alternatively, you could set up an irrigation system - but be careful to monitor it to make sure it is watering the roses the right amount and is working properly.  Water the ground at the base of the plant fairly slowly, pausing for it to soak in. Your aim is to wet the soil to a depth of about 18 inches (45.7 cm). After very dry spells the earth can bake hard and it can take longer for it to absorb water. Be patient!  , It’s usually best to avoid watering your rose bushes during the heat of the day. Try to get in the habit of watering them first thing in the morning before the sun gets too high.   This lets foliage dry off by the time the cooler evening air gets to them. If a rose has wet foliage it can be more at risk of mildew and blackspot. This isn’t a problem if you are using an irrigation system placed on the soil surface as the foliage won’t be getting wet. Even if you have an irrigation system in place, some gardeners recommend occasional watering from above using a hose or can, in order to dislodge any spider mites before they become a problem.  A thick layer of mulch applied around roses will really help to keep the moisture in the soil and reduce the need for watering as often.   Well-rotted horse manure works well for roses – apply after feeding them, ideally in late spring, and on damp earth. Apply a 3 inch (7.6 cm) depth around the rose when the ground isn’t cold or frozen. Every year, remove the spent mulch and replace it with a fresh layer. The start of the growing season (spring) is a good time to feed your roses and replace the mulch.  You can also help to reduce watering by incorporating a water-retaining material at planting time. These are available from garden stores and are designed to be mixed in with the soil or compost when planting.   Additionally, some varieties of rose are more drought-tolerant, or will even tolerate shade, so consider choosing one of these varieties to reduce water requirements.  Container grown roses tend to dry out a bit faster than ground planted ones, so these will need watering more. In hot conditions, be prepared to water container-grown roses every day.   You can help reduce water requirements by mulching. Inorganic mulches such as pebbles or gravel can work well in containers and look attractive. Also consider using a watering device such as a spike designed to water potted plants gradually over time. These can be purchased from garden stores, or make your own using an old plastic bottle using an online tutorial.  If your roses start to wilt and get droopy, they probably need watering.   Over the long term the leaves will dry up and wither and the flowers will bloom less and possibly even die. Smaller blooms and less of them is a sign a rose is stressed, probably due to lack of water.  Overwatering can cause root rot, especially in poor-draining soils. Signs to watch out for include yellow leaves and leaf drop, and new shoots wilting and dying away.   Take care that container-planted roses never sit in water. Avoid putting containers in trays, bowls or saucers. Too much water can also make the foliage chlorotic (yellowish and mottled).	Identify the type of soil in your garden. Consider the yearly weather conditions. Think about the age of your roses. Pay attention to the size of your rose bush. Determine how dry the soil is. Give the rose bushes a lot of water, less frequently. Use the right kind of watering can. Water the soil to a depth of 18 inches (45.7 cm). Water your roses first thing in the morning. Apply a thick layer of mulch to keep moisture in the soil. Reduce watering by incorporating a water-retaining material into the soil. Know that container-grown roses require more water. Water your roses immediately if they start to look droopy. Don't overwater roses, as this causes root rot.
If you practice in different driving situations, your ability to drive well will increase dramatically.  This is really helpful. Always think one or two steps ahead of your current action to reduce hesitation while driving. This will help you avoid accidents.  If there is a person who has the potential to distract you from driving, have them sit in the back and refrain from talking to you.  One of the worst things you can do while driving is to hesitate. If you choose to move to some area, make sure it is safe and then do so without hesitation. Drivers who hesitate and make jerky moves can make driving conditions hazardous to others around them.  There are many cases where the weather can pose a problem for drivers. Try to avoid these conditions as much as possible by watching the weather forecast. Practice driving in rainy, snowy, frosty and windy weather conditions within a safe environment, such as an abandoned car park.  By driving needlessly dangerously, you only show others you do not believe in your driving skills.  A good driver might overtake while seamlessly passing oncoming traffic with just two smooth flow-motion manoeuvres, while a clumsy driver will make driving straight on a deserted road look dangerous. There's a simple rule: All considerations must be taken before commencing the manoeuvre. Once you decide to do something, do it without hesitation. For example: Overtaking with an oncoming traffic is a hard decision to take. Once you decide on it, other drivers will be willing to slow down or move aside to let you pass, as long as you maintain your speed and heading. Understanding that you don't have the distance or engine power to complete the overtaking and hitting the brakes in the opposite side of the road would only bewilder any oncoming driver, who would be otherwise willing to slow down or get half of their vehicle in the shoulder of the road to let you by.  Get used to the maximum speed, acceleration, turn radius, overall size and stability of your vehicle. If you're a seasoned 18-wheeler driver, overtaking with only 2 inches (5.1 cm) of lateral distance wouldn't be a problem for you. If you just got your light vehicle driving license (B category in the EU, also known as a 'child's permit'), you need greater distance.  Never threaten large vehicles with your driving! Professional truck drivers are capable of handling situations that would get a less experienced driver killed. If you have a child's permit, remember those 18-wheelers are very quick in their acceleration and very hard in stopping! When you wait for a left turn and you see a 20-tonne Mercedes Actros coming your way, don't rely on the fact it's going to slow down, or be too clumsy to hit you! These modern tractors are capable of moving at 170 km/h (110 mph) especially when fully laden, and most of them do 0 to 100 faster than your car.          However, a head-on collision between a car and a tractor has never been won by the car hitherto!	Practice continuously. Always think what drivers around you are trying to do. Know who you are driving with. Be confident while driving. Know weather conditions. Do not show off. Be smooth. Know your vehicle. Heed larger vehicles.
If you have a lawn or a plot of land as part of your property, make sure that you cut your grass and clear out any brush regularly. Remove all dead or unhealthy plant life on a regular basis to minimize areas that could quickly catch fire and spread.Take a look at your lawn weekly to see if it needs trimming. Look for brown tips on blades of grass as an indicator of an unhealthy plant. Rake up and dispose of leaves, brush, tumbleweeds, and other dead plant matter as it enters your property. Do not allow it to sit or accumulate.; , If you have lumber, firewood, or other timber around your property, store it securely in a fire resistant closed box or in a raised, open container with a fire resistant tarp as a cover. Do not store any lumber directly against the side of your house.Fire resistant storage can be purchased from an outdoor specialty store, as well as online or at most home improvement stores.  Dead trees and scrub help a fire move faster, so it is important to remove them early and properly. If you notice a tree is browning and dying, cut the whole thing down and call your county to find out about disposal practices, or arrange for a local tree cutting company to come cut and haul the tree.Be sure to have the stump removed, as well. All of the dead wood needs to be cleared from your property. If you live in an area where brush grows wild, remove dead scrub from your property regularly. Look around your property at least once a month and clear out any new brush that may have come in.  Using non-flammable landscaping such as rocks, stones, or synthetic deck planks, create a fire-free area for the first five feet around the circumference of your home. Remove all leafy and piney plants as well as wooden features such as trellises immediately next to the home, and instead lay down a landscape of fire-resistant material.If you have the resources, you may consider having a deck or porch constructed around your home using fire-resistant materials. Xeriscape the area around your house using rocks, sand, and gravel as decorative features and low-moisture plants such as succulents and cacti., Avoid flammable materials such as wood and shake shingles when putting a new roof on your house. Instead, opt for fire-resistant roofing materials rated appropriate to the fire risk in your area.Contact a local roofing contractor to find out more about fire resistant roofing. Let them know, “I would like more information on making my roof safer to protect from potential wildfires.” Opt for a tiled or steel roof if possible.  Even when closed, windows readily let extreme amounts of heat into your home during a fire. Help ward off ignition from heat in your home by investing in heat resistant drapes or curtains, as well as non-combustible shutters for your windows.Temperature resistant window coverings can easily be found at home goods stores, as well as from specialty window treatment retailers in person and online. Pair heat resistant fabric with non-combustible shutters for the best results. The shutter close quickly from the outside, and can help lighten the burden of the fabric.  Most homes catch fires from embers, not from flames. Protect your home from interior ignition by installing ember resistant vents at all points where an ember could enter your home.Ember resistant vents are available through most home improvement stores. Depending upon your area, you may be able to find one readily or you may have to have the store order one for you.  In a scenario where the physical structure cannot be saved, you can often still save your personal valuables as long as you have a good plan. The first step is deciding what is valuable. Consider what you own that you would not be able to replace if lost.Important items often include computers or hard drives with personal work or data stored on them, identification documents like passports and birth certificates, deeds, titles, and ownership paperwork, valuable art or collections, and anything of personal value like family photo albums. Remember that this list should also include children, pets, and any other living thing that will not be able to successfully evacuate itself from your home. Consider your spatial limitations. If you must evacuate, you will likely do so in your own vehicle and in a restricted time period. Realistically think about how much can fit in there along with the people evacuating, and how much you can load in the five to ten minutes you will have.  If you live in a high fire risk area, it may benefit you to keep all of the valuables you want to take with you near one another. Consider storing important documents in a single fire or folder, and keep other valuable items near that folder.   Invest in an external hard drive to backup your computer, and keep the hard drive with the rest of your valuables. Likewise, consider making copies of family photos or other items of personal significance and storing them with your other valuables.  Invest in a fireproof safe to store your valuables in the event that a wildfire reaches your home. This way, if you do not have the chance to grab everything during an evacuation, your belongings are still secure and safe from the fire.Such safes can be purchased online or through speciality retailers. In some areas, department stores and big box stores may also carry them.  If you see a fire without fire crews in attendance, call your emergency numbers immediately. Let them know the location and severity of the fire, as well as what danger it poses to you and your home.Never assume that a fire has been reported unless you see emergency services on site. Always report a wildfire.  The old and very young should be evacuated straight away as the wildfire gets stronger. As a rule, houses with people there to protect them will survive far better than those without anyone.If you have a chance to evacuate when the wildlife gets serious, evacuate straight away. If you cannot evacuate you must stay at your home and strongly defend it with whatever resources you have, such as hoses and extinguishers.  Take action to evacuate once you know there is a fire in your area. If you know there is a fire in your area, don’t wait for the police call to evacuate. You don't want to be on the roads when the fire is near. They are dangerous and crowded during a fire emergency.Put you and other people first before objects or animals. Many people get seriously injured from putting their belongings first. If you have the time, save what you can. But if not you will need to think about the safety of others in your household.  Keep in mind that just because the fire has passed doesn't necessarily mean you are out of danger. Keep an ear on the radio or TV for fire updates, and stay on the lookout for a flare up or a renewed ember attack.   Have a local radio or TV station tuned to a news report at all times to track the progress of the fire.	Regularly cut your grass. Store wood safely. Clear dead trees. Create a fire-free area. Choose the right roofing. Invest in your window coverings. Protect your vents. Decide what is valuable. Keep valuables closely assembled. Buy a safe. Let authorities know. Evacuate sooner rather than later. Take action quickly. Listen for updates.
Talk to your family about the appropriate actions to take in order to stay safe during a landslide, especially if you live in a vulnerable area. Be sure to discuss evacuation procedures, as well as safe locations and areas to avoid., Make sure everyone knows how to get emergency alerts from local officials, whether it be via phone, television, or radio. Talk to your local emergency management agency to see how alerts are delivered in your area.Don’t forget to emphasize the importance of listening to the local news station for emergency updates in the event of a landslide!  , Write down each family member’s phone number, email, social media, medical facilities, and school or workplace. Having this information on hand will make it easier for family members to get in touch in the event of landslide or other emergency., In the event of a landslide or other emergency, choose a place where the family will meet to reunite. Select a location in your neighborhood and your town. Make sure everyone is aware of the location.Choose a location that is accessible for everyone in your family, particularly for members with disabilities. If you have pets, pick a pet-friendly area. You might choose to meet at a neighbor’s house or your mailbox for your neighborhood location, and at a community center or a place of worship for your town location.  Compile contact information, landslide safety protocol, and your emergency meeting places on a single document. This is your emergency plan. Give every family member a copy and make sure they carry it with them at all times.Put a copy somewhere central in your home, like on the fridge. You may also want to make an emergency plan for your business.  Meet with your household periodically to review your plan and practice landslide safety protocol. This is important if you live in an area where landslides are common.	Discuss safety protocol in the event of a landslide. Understand how to get emergency alerts. Collect family members’ contact information. Pick an emergency meeting place. Compile and share your plan. Practice your plan.
The base of the triangle should be about 10-12cm (4-6"), the edges the same.  Use additional small pieces of card or poster tack to wedge it into place., This is the bit that will be above the water. Slip string through this and tie a small knot to prevent the string slipping back through. Trim the string to neaten., Wrap around this round knob several times. Leave string dangling down for the next step.	Cut a piece of strong but thin card into a triangle, for the sail. Slide the triangle into the clothespin slit. Pierce a small hole in the top corner of the sail. Pull the string taut from the sail to the round clothespin end.
They are usually sold between $15 and, for the really fancy ones with many voices, around $180. It is best to buy a well-working but fairly cheap one with a few voices for about $25.; , You should keep the manual handy for easy reference.  Examine the notes (are they mostly whole, half, quarter, eighth, etc...?), the time signature (4/4, 2/4, 6/8...), and the tempo.  Most metronomes offer quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes, as well as some other strange combinations. Unless you are playing a very complicated song that is mostly eighth or sixteenth notes, you should choose the quarter note setting, as it will help you count half and whole notes, too.  Most metronomes offer 1 - 9. This is simple, just see the top number in your time signature.  Usually, somewhere between 80 and 125 BPM works well. Figure out how fast the music is before setting the BPM. To experiment, set the tempo around 100 BPM and see if the song sounds right. If not, fix it.  If the music is loud (forte or louder), choose a loud voice, like clapping, although ticking is most common.	Purchase an electronic metronome. Before you do anything else, read the instruction manual that comes with the metronome. Choose a piece of music to play. First, set the beat subdivision. Now, set the beats per measure. Next, choose a tempo (the beats per minute). Finally, select a voice.
Sufficient light is one of the most important contributing factors when trying to get a Hoya to bloom.The ideal location indoors is right in front of a window facing east or west where it is exposed to two to four hours of direct sunlight.   Your plant should also be exposed to bright, indirect light during the rest of the day.; , It can also be placed in front of a window that faces south, as long as there is a sheer curtain between the plant and the window to help diffuse the hot, direct sunlight.When the plant is left in a south window all day without a sheer curtain for shade, the leaves will scorch, becoming very pale or tan.  If the Hoya plant is over three years old and is still not blooming, try giving it one or two more hours of direct sunlight each day.   Other signs that the Hoya is not getting enough light are new leaves that are small and pale green, long sections of bare stem, slow growth and dead mature leaves.  Use water that has been left sitting in an open container for 24 hours or more.Leaving the water to sit allows the chlorine and fluorine, chemicals found in tap water that can harm a Hoya plant, to dissipate into the air naturally.The water will also be at room temperature which is better for Hoyas. Fresh tap water is very cold and could stress these tropical plants.  This allows the plant to retain its moisture during the day. Distribute the water over the potting soil evenly until it begins to drain out of the drain holes in the bottom of the container.  If left in the saucer, the excess water could wick up into the container and keep the soil too wet.   Wet soil deprives the Hoya roots of oxygen and encourages root rot.  A winter rest period helps Hoyas bloom the following spring or summer.  Hoya plant leaves will turn yellow and drop if it is being watered too much. Water it less often. If the leaves continue to turn yellow and drop, turn the container on its side and gently slide the Hoya out of the container. Shake the potting soil off the roots to get a good look at them.If they have black tips or the whole root is black or brown and mushy, the Hoya has root rot. If most of the roots are rotten, the plant should be thrown away. If only a few are bad, repot it using peat-based potting soil that contains perlite or vermiculite for improved drainage. Be sure to use a container with drain holes. Water it immediately but then let the soil become completely dry before watering again.If the plant shrivels, it is not being watered often enough. Water it more often.	Place your Hoya near a window. Hang sheer curtains if you place your plant in front of a south-facing window. Give your plant additional sunlight to help it bloom. Let the potting soil dry out almost all the way before watering a Hoya plant during the spring, summer and fall. Water Hoyas in the morning. Dump the excess water out of the saucer beneath the container. Let the potting mix dry completely before watering your plant in the winter to encourage the Hoya to have a rest period. Recognize signs that your plant is being watered too much, or has rotted.
Get your limousine booked as soon as you can. At busy times of the year, such as prom season, limousines get reserved quickly. Wedding planners recommend reserving a limousine 6 months in advance of the event. Find and reserve the limousine you want as soon as you know the date you will need it.; , Decide if you want a standard limousine, or if you need a larger car with extra amenities, such as television screens and wireless Internet connections. Most limousines can hold between 5 and 14 passengers.  All limousine companies must carry insurance. Verify their coverage, and ask about whether their cars or chauffeurs have been in any accidents.   Ask how they screen their chauffeurs, and whether they are local to your area. You do not want to risk getting lost.  What you get for your money will depend on whether you are hiring the limousine for a single and specific trip, or for an entire evening. Most companies provide wedding and prom packages.   Ask the limousine company if there are other charges beyond their hourly or package rate. Some companies will include the gratuity, and there may be other fees to consider as well.  When you find a limousine you would like to book, you will need to sign a contract for the date and time that you need it. Be sure the contract includes all of the details of your event or trip, including the time of pick up and drop off, your full itinerary, the make, model, and year of the limousine you have chosen, the number of people traveling, rates and any other charges.  Most limousine companies will require you to put money down at the time of booking. Ask about the terms of the deposit, such as how much is required, and whether it is refundable in the event of cancellation.  Many limousine companies have strict cancellation policies, so find out if you are able to cancel once you hire your limousine, and what your deadline is to do so.	Plan ahead. Choose a size and style. Check out insurance and safety records. Determine your budget. Sign a contract. Pay a deposit. Check into refund and cancellation policies. Finished.
Concrete is best, as jacks and jack stands can sink into asphalt on hot summer days. This affects the stability of the vehicle and damages the asphalt surface. Work in a shady spot or direct sun? It will probably take a few hours to do both sides of one axle if it is the first time doing this work, so plan accordingly.; , Assume the driver side will be worked on first for this wiki. , Place one chock block ahead of the front tire and a second behind the rear tire to prevent the vehicle from rolling in either direction.  to allow access to the lug nuts. , Use the manufacturer's supplied jack or use a floor jack to raise the vehicle, and locate to lift only at the manufacturer's designated points on the vehicle.  Do not attempt to work on any vehicle supported only by a jack. If supporting the vehicle at the axle, do so closest to the wheels. Do not support or lift the axle solely at the the differential. ,,, Note: these are made of soft metal and are easily damaged. Slip a length of snug fitting clear hose over the screw to direct fluid into a container on the ground.  Do this until the pads are no longer pressed firmly against the rotor. Expect brake fluid to be expelled from the bleeder screw as the piston is forced into the caliper.  Do not turn hose more than half a turn to avoid kinking the hose. (On some vehicles a banjo bolt secures the hose to the caliper, in which case the hose can be removed in this step, and step 16 may be omitted.)  , On rear disk brakes, the parking brake is removed from the caliper and the procedure varies from vehicle to vehicle. It will not be possible to remove the rear caliper if the parking brake is engaged. ,, The correct caliper will have the bleeder nut oriented at the top (or very close to the top) after being installed on the vehicle. Failure to install the correct caliper will trap air in the system. This will cause a "spongy" feeling brake pedal and possibly brake failure. Hold both calipers near the rotor, oriented as they would be installed on the vehicle and install only the caliper that has the bleeder nut at the top.  The bulk of this brake work is the caliper and pad removal and replacement. Not servicing the rotors while accessible now is practically "negligent". Consider removing the rotor for machining (called "turning" on a lathe) to remove glazing, gouges and grooves. Well traveled rotors are often glazed and result in extended stopping distances. If the rotor is too worn or has deep grooves or has significant rust; replacement may be required (often times replacing with new rotors for $25 or so is better than machining old rotors for $15). Actual cost of machining or replacement rotors is dependent on vehicle type, supply house pricing, etc., and is a matter of personal choice. Many full service auto supply shops offer rotor machining. It is illegal however, to machine rotors that are too thin or otherwise unsafe for re-installation on the vehicle. (this step is not needed, if c-clamp was used during caliper removal)  ,,,, Slip clear hose over the screw to direct fluid into a container on the ground. Release the hose clamping pliers or vice grips.  Add additional fluid to maintain the level above minimum.  Tighten bleeder. Have helper pump brakes 3 times, and hold. release bleeder valve. to drain air and tighten. Repeat process until no air is found.Monitor the brake bleeder screw hose, and close the screw when a steady stream of fluid with no bubbles comes out. Remove the hose and container. , While pressing the wheel firmly and evenly against the rotor, spin the lug nuts onto the studs "snug tight". It is not required to have the lug nuts fully tight at this point. The next step will complete this process.  Fully tighten lug nuts to appropriate torque specifications with the tire in contact with the ground. Tighten lug nuts in a "star" pattern; do not tighten adjacent lug nuts in a circular "one after the other" pattern.  Remove any spilled fluid from painted surfaces quickly as the finish can be damaged if allowed to sit for even a short time. , Perform brake testing at low speeds away from people and buildings if at all possible. Gradually increase speed for testing.	Park on a solid, level surface. Determine which side to do first. Make sure parking brake is NOT engaged if working on the rear calipers.  , Chock the wheels on the passenger side of the vehicle. Remove wheel covers, hub caps, etc. Loosen each lug nut no more than 1 full turn.  , Raise the vehicle. Use jack stands to support the vehicle. Check and reposition the chock blocks if needed, to ensure there is no room for movement of the vehicle.  , Remove the lug nuts and place in hub cap.  , Remove wheel and tire assembly.  , Open the bleeder screw with a socket or the box end of a wrench. Compress the piston back into the caliper using a large c-clamp. Use a flare nut wrench to loosen the hose where it is connected to the caliper. Remove the caliper from the steering knuckle using wrenches or hex sockets as required. Turn the caliper to the left to unscrew it from the brake hose after the caliper is free from the steering knuckle.  , Retain the caliper in case you need to reuse any hardware or the bleeder screw.  , Select the correct caliper for the side of the vehicle being replaced. Inspect rotors. Fully compress the piston and install the new brake pads into the caliper. Attach the brake hose to the caliper making sure to use the new copper washers that came with the new caliper and fit the assembly over the rotor.  , Secure the caliper to the steering knuckle in reverse order of removal steps above.  , Finish tightening the hose to the caliper if not done already, being careful not to over-tighten it.  , Install the bleeder screw loosely. Open the hood, and monitor the fluid level in the brake reservoir. Have a helper compress the brake pedal and hold it to the floor. Pump the brake pedal with the engine off until a solid feel is obtained.  , Reinstall the wheel and tire. Lower the vehicle. Fill brake fluid reservoir to appropriate level, reinstall the cover and close the hood. Repeat for passenger side of the vehicle if desired.  , Test drive. Tighten lug nuts and secure wheel cover, hub cap, etc.
On a small sailing vessel, the crew may consist of only a captain and one or two hands, or persons charged with operating the boat. In this situation, the first mate acts as a hand in the craft's operation, but for larger vessels, the first mate is the second in command, and on shifts, may be the officer of the deck, or OD.; , No first mate would hesitate to immediately set to a task when he is ordered to it by the skipper of the vessel.  Here are some examples with their definitions:   The deck. This is the main level of the vessel, usually referring to the exterior area around the cabin (or superstructure of large ships). The wheelhouse. This is the location, usually an interior area with windows and the wheel, which is used to steer the vessel. Below decks. On small craft, this may simply be a cabin, the head (bathroom), the engine compartment, and whatever storage space is built into the boat. Larger vessels may include a galley, crew's and officer's quarters, a hold (for cargo), a bilge, and a variety of other specialized compartments. Stern/aft. The rear of the vessel. Port. The left side of the vessel. Starboard. The right side of the vessel. Forward, or any designation including the prefix for/fore designates the front of the vessel, such as foredeck, forecastle, etc.  For a sailing ship, you should understand the nomenclature and purpose of the rigging, including all hardware, lines, spars, mast, sheets, and be able to tend them efficiently if the need should arise, for instance, the crew falls ill or someone is injured.  This is a critical issue where the captain's ability and mental condition are suspect, of course, since the safety of the vessel and crew are dependent on a captain making good decisions in every circumstance, but knowing the captain also makes it possible for the first mate to anticipate orders, keep the ship and crew in pleasing form, and make life more pleasant for everyone in the cramped spaces of a ship or boat.  On a long voyage, the first mate must help keep the crew cheerful and in good spirits. This means being an arbitrator in disputes, maintaining discipline, making sure everyone pulls their own weight, and keeping things running smoothly.  Keep tackle and gear stored properly, make sure cargo and stores are secured, be aware of the condition of rigging or engines, know how much fuel, food and water are on hand, and make sure hatches are kept secured. Keeping the deck clear of debris and loose lines and tackle makes for a safer environment for everyone.  When the captain gives an order, carry it out by giving accurate and concise instructions to the crewman responsible for completing the task. For particular tasks, it is advisable to attend to it or observe it being taken care of personally.  Sea voyages are often boring and lacking in physical challenge on modern vessels, but when a crisis occurs, equipment fails, or severe weather is encountered, the first mate must be able to physically perform his duties without fail.  Even with modern communications, satellite weather technology, and onboard radar, nothing can replace a pair of sharp eyes scanning the seas and skies for approaching squall lines or other vessels wandering into the path of your ship.  Knowing each person will make the job of managing their efforts much easier, since personalities often dictate different management techniques to get optimum performance from the crew.  This means being willing to take a midnight shift at the helm, talk about personal problems with a deckhand, or taking orders.	Understand what a first mate is, and what his duties are. Obey orders in a timely and certain fashion. Understand sea language. Know the functional elements of the vessel. Know your captain. Keep morale up. Run a tight ship. Communicate effectively with the crew. Stay in top shape. Observe the seas and weather for unusual events. Get to know all the hands on the boat personally. Make yourself available at all times, for both the captain and crew.
To generalize trance or house as "techno" is like generalizing death metal as "rock". Be willing to listen to new music and search "What is electronic music?" In the broadest sense, any music incorporating electronic elements ("instruments", samples, synthesis, effects) can be considered electronic. Most popular music today could meet this definition.; , Electronic music commonly uses drum machines, samples (sound clips), and/or synthesizers and effects processors.  Tempo (song speed) is often measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM), and electronic music songs may vary widely in BPM.	Don't use the word "techno" as a catch-all term for all electronic music. Understand electronic music composition. Understand that not all electronic music is fast or meant for dancing.
Find a stick that is between 12 and 18 inches long, and about as thick as your finger. Use sandpaper to smooth away any rough spots, especially on the top and bottom of the stick. Decorate your stick with silk flowers, fake leaves, glitter, and ribbon. You can add a large fake flower or butterfly to the top of your wand.  Find a wooden dowel that is between 12 and 18 inches long. Draw squiggles and vines over the dowel using hot glue. You can also glue on some beads or jewels onto the dowel as well. Wait for the glue to set, then paint the entire wand a solid color using acrylic paint. The glue will give the wand an embossed look.   To create shadows, take a slightly darker color than the one your used for your wand, and apply it to the nooks and crannies of the designs. You can use a small paintbrush or even a Q-tip. To create highlights, dip a folded paper towel into a slightly lighter color than the one you used for your wand, and gently rub it over your designs. You can also use silver or gold for this technique as well.  Take two differently colored pipe cleaners and twist them together to make a striped stick. Bend another pipe cleaner into a fun shape, such as a star or heart, and twist it to your pipe cleaner stick using one of the loose ends. Tie a few long pieces of ribbon around the top of your wand, just under the fun shape.  You can use anything you want for the topper, but don't decorate the glowstick itself. When you are ready to play with your wand, snap the glowstick and shake it to activate it.	Make a natural fairy wand. Make an embossed fairy wand. Make a simple wand out of several pipe cleaners. Make a wand using a glowstick instead of a dowel.
If you're going to attempt a ballroom dancing routine, your posture is of utmost importance. Before attempting any ballroom steps, work on developing proper posture.   Keep your chin parallel to the floor. Hold your head upright.Lift your chest in order to lengthen your spine.Stand on both feet. Keep your weight placed just slightly forward of your body's center., The rock step is a basic ballroom move. This can be fun to use if you're creating your own dance routine.   The rhythm used in the rock step is "one and two, three and four." You'll have to think of these words while dancing to keep your rhythm steady.Stand with your feet together. Lift one foot. Cross this foot behind the other foot. Place the foot roughly 12 inches behind the other foot, trying to form something of a 45 degree angle. Transfer your weight to your back foot, standing on the ball of your foot. Count "one" as you do this. Immediately shift your weight back to your front foot, counting "and." Return your feet to the original position, counting "two."Three and four follow the exact same steps. You simply reverse which foot goes in front and which foot goes in back., The grapevine is a simple step for a fast-paced ballroom dance routine. One foot steps directly to the side. The other foot crosses that foot. You repeat this process continually, altering feet., A triple step is a basic ballroom dance move. You could use this in a ballroom routine or just a dance routine in general. It's a bit faster and less balanced than the rock step, so it may take some time to perfect.   Like the rock step, the triple step is counted "one and two, three and four." However, "one and" and "three and" are counted quicker than the other steps.Stand with your feet together and then lift and step forward with your right foot. Count "one" as you do this and then quickly shift your weight onto your left foot while counting "and." Shift back to the right foot, counting "two."Use the count of three to move your left foot forward. For the remainder of the steps, repeat the above motion but use your left foot to step forward instead.	Keep your posture proper. Learn the rock step. Try the grapevine. Use a basic triple step.
This will help you put the replacement wiper back in the correct position once the current wiper has been removed. Bar soap, wax, or another easy to remove mark will work fine.  This may require that the hood be opened.  Most designs have a plastic or metal dust cap that covers the drive post and hex nut that hold the wiper arm in place. With this dust cap removed, you will have the access you need to remove the nut.  Now that the dust cap is removed and you can analyze the hex nut that holds the wiper arm onto the drive post you should choose a socket that fits it. Place the socket on the ratchet or, if needed, on an extension that is attached to the ratchet.  Ratchets are designed to twist nuts and bolts on and off. You want to be sure you are set to spin in a counter clockwise direction. This will loosen the nut.  Using your ratchet to remove this nut will allow you to remove the wiper arm from the vehicle.   Place the socket and ratchet fully over the hex nut and hold in place with one hand while Stabilizing the wiper arm by firmly gripping it with the other hand. This will prevent the linkage from exceeding the designed range of motion when twisting the ratchet. Twist the ratchet to spin the nut counter clockwise one half to one full turn. Once the hex nut is loosened, release your grip of the wiper arm and remove the socket and ratchet from the hex nut. Spin the hex nut completely off by hand and set aside for reuse.  Lift the wiper blade up from the windshield with one hand and hold the point of attachment with the other. Gently "rock" the wiper blade back and forth while lifting with both hands and remove from the drive post.	Mark where the windshield wiper blade rests. Follow the wiper arm away from the wiper blade to its base. Remove the dust cap at the base of wiper arm. Select a socket sized to fit the hex nut. Set the ratchet to allow it to loosen the nut. Remove the nut that fastens the windshield wiper arm to the drive post. Remove the entire wiper arm from the drive post.
To make these glitter sneakers, you will need a pair of sneakers, some fine glitter (in the color or colors of your choice), a pot of glitter paint, a paintbrush, a roll of painter's tape and a pot of Modge Podge.; , Make sure your sneakers are completely clean, or else use a brand new pair of sneakers for this project.   If you're using an old pair of fabric or canvas, consider putting them in the washing machine. If they are not machine washable, use a damp cloth to remove as much dirt as possible. Remove the laces from the sneakers, then take the painter's tape and use to it to cover up any areas of the shoe you don't want to bedazzle -- such as the rubber sole and the tongue.  Pour a large drop of glitter paint onto a paper plate, then sprinkle the loose glitter on top.          Mix with a paintbrush or lollipop stick until you achieve a slightly grainy consistency -- but don't allow the paint to become too chunky or dry. If necessary, add more of the glitter or paint until you achieve the right consistency.  Take a paintbrush and dip it in the glittery paint. Place your free hand inside the shoe to hold it up, then start painting!          Try to apply a thin, even layer of the paint over the entire shoe. If you pile it on too thickly, the paint may take a very long time to dry. Once you have finished painting the first shoe, do the same with the second. Remember that you can always paint an extra layer of glitter paint once the original layer has dried. It's better to apply several thin layers than a single thick coat.  Once the layer or layers of glitter paint have dried completely, take the bottle of Modge Podge and pour a large drop onto a paper plate. Take a clean paintbrush and start applying it to the sneakers.          The Modge Podge will seal the glitter (making sure it doesn't fall off) and add shine to the sneakers. Don't worry if it looks white at first, it will turn clear once it dries. Leave the shoes to dry overnight, then reinsert the laces and enjoy your new glitter shoes!  , Once you have the basic method down, you can experiment with a few different variations of this glitter technique.           Use different color glitters: Instead of just using a single color glitter on your sneakers, you could experiment with mixing glitters and paints to create a cool, multi-toned sparkle. Think about mixing pink and purple glitters with silver paint, or red and orange glitter with gold paint. You could even mix all seven colors of the rainbow!  Create an ombre effect: Another good idea is to create an ombre effect by using three complimentary colors of glitter and fading them into each other. Mix each color glitter with paint on a separate plate, then use the first color glitter to paint 1/3 of the shoe, from the heel forwards. Once that layer is dry, use a clean paintbrush to paint the second color glitter on the next 1/3 of the shoe, starting about 1/2 an inch behind where the first color ended. Do the same with the third color, painting all the way to the toe. Use stencils: Instead of painting the entire shoe with glitter, you could use stencils to create glittery designs and patterns on your sneakers. Press plastic or fabric stencils onto the shoe, or create your own using painters tape. With this technique, you can create pretty shimmering butterflies, stars, hearts, flowers, skulls -- anything you like!  , Instead of painting the glittery glue onto the shoes, you could try sprinkling it instead!          All you need are a pair of canvas sneakers, a bottle of fabric glue, some fine, loose glitter, a pot of Modge Podge and a paintbrush. Paint a layer of fabric glue onto the canvas parts of a clean pair of sneakers (with the laces removed). Hold the sneakers over a sheet of newspaper and start sprinkling the loose glitter directly onto the glue. You'll need to work quickly, to ensure that the glue doesn't dry. Once you have cover the sneakers in a layer of glitter, give them a gentle shake to remove any excess. Paint a layer of Modge Podge over the sneakers to seal the glitter and add shoes. Leave the shoes to dry overnight before reinserting the laces and wearing.	Gather your supplies. Prepare your sneakers. Mix the glitter paint and loose glitter. Begin painting the shoes. Apply a layer of Modge Podge. Try some variations. Experiment with an alternative technique.
If you have natural lowbush blueberries growing in the local woods, you may be able to use these directly. It is possible to take rhizomes from existing blueberry clones and grow them in pots. These can then be planted in your yard for native landscaping and berries. If they are grown in their native environment, there will be no need to amend for pH; check your soil, as the pH should range between 4.5 and 6.0.; , Blueberries are highly variable plants. You may even find huckleberry. This is the time to select for: size       berry color       fall leaf color       flavor; and       species. , Taking pieces between 6 and 12 inches in length. Some of the pieces may have above ground stems which can be left attached. Select from several clones, this aids in pollination and fruit set.  Fill the bottom half with sand and the top with peat. Plant the rhizome in the peat just above the sand.  Keep pots moist but not waterlogged.  After a few weeks some of the plants with above ground parts will break bud. At this time move them to a sunny location until ready for out-planting. Fertilize sparingly with a soluble fertilizer designed for acidic plants, available at most garden centers. Keep pots moist.  Try to get as much sun as possible if fruit is desired. Also avoid close proximity to concrete walks and foundations (high pH). Simply dig a shallow hole and set the rootball in and backfill. Because these are rhizomatous plants, planting depth is not super critical but deeper is probably better than shallow. Cover with a shallow mulch (bark). Weeding is important as blueberries do not tolerate heavy competition.  This forces the plants to put their energy into vegetative growth. The first few sets of fruit aren't much anyway; doing this will pay good dividends in the fruit set approximately 3-4 years later.	Select naturally. Identify which plants to grow during the preceding growing season. Mark desirable plants with ribbon.  , Collect the rhizomes.In early spring a few weeks before bud break dig rhizomes from the selected blueberry plants. Plant the rhizomes in one gallon pots. Place the pots in a semi shaded (protected) place. Prepare for out-planting. Finally, locate where you want to plant the blueberries. Remove the flowers for the first two years.
If you're still in the airport when you discover that your luggage was stolen, find the baggage claim office of the last airline you were on and report the theft immediately.Most airlines will have a baggage claim office located close to their baggage claim carousels, or along the outside walls of the airport's baggage claim area. Even if you have no idea when your bag was stolen, you should report the theft to the last airline you were on. Let them sort out the details of where your luggage was stolen. If you notice the theft in the airport, you should report it right then. However, if you have a situation in which items you packed were stolen from your bag, you may not discover the theft until later. Airlines typically require you to file a report within 24 hours. For this reason, you should open your checked bags at your earliest convenience – for example, as soon as you've checked into your hotel – and evaluate the contents. If you notice something missing after you've left the airport, call the airline's toll-free customer service number or search for a claim form on the airline's website.; , Whether in person or over the phone, insist on completing a written report and make sure you have a copy of the report for your records. Not only will you need it for reference, but you may need to submit it to an insurance company.Some baggage agents may want you to wait a few days to see if your bag turns up. Essentially, they'll want to categorize it as missing first, then re-categorize it as stolen if it doesn't show up after a few days. However, if you go along with this, you've lost valuable time during which you could have been filing reports with law enforcement agencies such as the local police and airport security. The agent will allow you to report your luggage stolen if you insist. You may need to exercise the same assertiveness if you're filing your report over the phone. If you file your report online or over the phone, make sure a written copy of the report is emailed to you so you have it for your records and to provide to law enforcement or insurance agencies.  The extent to which the airline is liable for your loss varies among airlines and whether you were on an international or U.S. domestic flight. You should be able to find a basic summary of the applicable regulations at the airport or on the airline's website.For example, airlines are not liable for the loss of the contents of your stolen bag that are in excess of around $3,000. Some airlines may extend this coverage if you pay a small fee when you book your flight. Many international carriers have even lower limits which may not even come close to covering everything you had packed in your stolen luggage. Airline liability for lost or stolen luggage on international flights is governed by two international agreements. The Montreal Pact covers Canada, Australia, and European countries, as well as some others. Most other countries are covered by the Warsaw Pact. Consumer agencies and travel publishers frequently have summaries of these agreements and how they affect you if your luggage is lost or stolen. It can be a good idea to see if you can find a brochure that outlines your rights and the airline's responsibilities, so you can reference it when speaking with airline baggage or customer service agents.  After filing your report, set reminders for yourself and check on the status of your claim at least once a day until it's resolved. The airline may not be in any rush to assess the situation unless you keep on them.The airline should give you a claim number when you file your written report. You can use that number to access your claim and get status updates, either online or over the phone. Many major airlines have online apps you can use to check the status of your claim and set notifications when there is any significant change. Start a log, and write down the date and time you talk to anyone at the airline, as well as the name of the person with whom you spoke. Get a first and last name, as well as a job title, so you can identify them if you speak to anyone else.  Particularly if specific items were stolen from your bag, but not the bag itself, you must file a police report as soon as possible after you discover the theft. The airline and airport security agencies may require a copy of a police report before they take any action.Even if the local police insist that they don't have jurisdiction inside the airport, or that you have no way of knowing where your items were stolen, insist that the report be created. If you're flying on a U.S. domestic flight, you also should file a theft report with the TSA. The agency has an online claim form you can use. You also want to file a police report as soon as possible – typically within 24 hours of your discovery of the theft. The sooner you report the theft, the greater the likelihood that your luggage might be recovered. Make sure you get copies of all written law enforcement reports you file so you have them for your records.  If you're dissatisfied with the response you're getting from the airline, ask to speak to a supervisor and work your way up the chain of command. This can be especially effective if you have an airline agent claiming the airline isn't liable for your losses when you know legally they are.Any time you're speaking with a supervisor or manager, take the time to go through the timeline of your claim and correct any inaccuracies. As with customer service or baggage claim agents, get the name and job title of anyone with whom you speak. Repeat their words back to them or ask them to put anything significant they say to you in writing so you can hold them accountable.	Locate the baggage claim office. File a written report. Review the laws or regulations that apply to your flight. Keep in contact with the airline. File a police report. Escalate your claim.
The number of people in your family, the nature of your activities, and whether you take your pets on the go all factor into the size of the vehicle you need. Some SUVs offer the ultimate in extra passenger space—third-row seating—while others offer little more space than a 4-door sedan would.   If your lifestyle calls for transporting a lot of equipment, or 4 or more people at a time, you will probably need a third row of seating.Consider a larger SUV like a Chevrolet Tahoe, or a GMC Yukon. Some smaller SUVs have third row seating as well, so if you need more seats but don’t want to drive a really big SUV, try a Toyota Highlander or a Honda Pilot.; , If you will be regularly taking your vehicle off road, consider a Jeep Wrangler.If you want something more highway friendly, try a crossover or a hybrid SUV. For more on those, see below.  Off-road driving and towing large things like boats will require the power of 4WD. 4WD vehicles offer better traction, and more stability control, which are both great to have when taking the vehicle off-road.Consider a 4WD model if you plan to use your vehicle off road, or even if you live in a place where it snows most months of the year., Do you have kids who might do a number on the interior of your SUV? Or, would you prefer a luxury vehicle? You may need to decide whether you need functionality over luxury.   In terms of luxury SUVs, a Range Rover would be a good option on the smaller end, while an Escalade might be a good choice if you need that extra space. For a more durable and easier-to-clean interior, consider a Nissan Xterra., With gas prices always fluctuating and often on the rise, fuel efficiency is as important today as it has ever been when considering purchasing a new vehicle.   Kelley Blue Book recently named the 2015 Lexus NX 300h the most fuel efficient SUV, with an estimated 35MPG city and 31MPG highway.Other SUVs that made the top ten list for most fuel efficient include the 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek (29MPG city, 33MPG highway), the 2014 Mini Cooper Countryman (28MPG city, 35MPG highway), and the 2015 Lexus RX 450h (32MPG city, 28MPG highway).  When it comes to fuel efficiency, hybrid models will usually get you the most bang for your buck, as they combine both electric and gas power.   The Toyota Highlander offers a Hybrid model that also has a third row seat., You won’t want to buy an SUV that will constantly require repairs or maintenance.   A survey of 34,000 drivers on the need for repairs in the first three years of ownership rated the GMC Yukon as needing very little work over that time.One the more luxurious end, JD Power’s Vehicle Dependability Study also rated the Buick Enclave as a highly dependable vehicle in the first three years of ownership., A crossover is essentially defined by the type of platform it is built upon. While a traditional SUV is built using a truck platform, a crossover uses a car platform. So, while this isn’t the only different between SUVs and crossovers, it is one defining characteristic to be aware of when deciding between the two.There are truck/SUV crossovers such as the Honda Ridgeline that offer the interior and space of an SUV as well as a truck bed.The other crossover option is the van/SUV. These include models such as the Kia Sportage, and the Ford Escape. These are especially popular family vehicles, as they often have high safety ratings, and are generous on interior space while not feeling as large or as intimidating as a full-size SUV.Subcompact SUVs, like the 2016 Honda HR-V, are becoming more and more popular on the roads. Their length is more similar to small cars, but they boast an SUV-style body that allows for maximum interior space and versatility, without the hefty fuel price or sizes of full-size SUVs. These subcompact SUVs average about 4MPG more in both city and highway tests than compact SUVs, so they are fuel efficient as well as spacious., As with any car purchase, a high safety rating is definitely a good selling point. Don’t hesitate to ask a salesperson for detailed information on safety features and ratings of a car you are interested in. Alternatively, you can do the research yourself online.   In Kelley Blue Book’s list of the 35 best safety rated SUVs of 2016, the Acura MDX, Acura RDX, BMW X3, and the BMW X5 took the top spots.If you have children, you might also want to look into the child seat attachment availability in the backseat. The 2016 Volvo XC90 was rated the best car for families in 2016 by U.S. News due to its safety ratings, handsfree liftgate, stylish appearance (for those Dads who definitely don’t want to be caught in a Mom-mobile!), and its large cargo capacity., Both luxury and non-luxury vehicles are coming standard with more and more features and upgrades. Know the options available to you with the SUV model you choose.   Many new cars have tech features like in-dash touchscreens, remote start, and even apps that allow you to lock your car from anywhere. Some of these features even address safety issues—back-up cameras allow for safer reversing, blind spot monitoring notifies you (usually with a light in your side mirror) if a car is driving in your blind spot, and some newer model cars even hit the brakes for you to prevent you from hitting an oncoming object.	Determine what amount of space you need. Decide how you will be using the vehicle. Consider your need for 4 wheel drive. Think about your lifestyle. Consider fuel efficiency. Consider a hybrid model. Choose a dependable model. Think about crossovers. Look into safety features. Check out available upgrades.
Car stereo systems with a standard-size, push-button display screen are equipped with buttons for programming radio stations, display features and switching between stereo functions. Car audio systems with enlarged LCD displays are often equipped with touch-screen capabilities to allow you to program and operate the system's functions by touching the screen instead of pushing buttons. These systems are more expensive and may not fit in smaller or older cars.; ,   Some high-end car audio systems come equipped with docking stations that can be programmed to play songs off an iPod or MP3 player. Be sure your model and brand of device will be compatible with the stereo system you choose.    Car audio systems with Bluetooth functions can be programmed to operate a Bluetooth hands-free device, such as a cell phone. This type of system will be more expensive, but will make your commute safer.    Some car stereo systems are equipped to play "burned" CDs that have had songs copied from your home computer or MP3 player. Not all car sound systems include this capability as a standard feature, so verify the system you're considering can play these CDs.    Trunk-mounted systems are housed in the car's trunk and need to be specially wired. These provide better security, since they can't be seen, but are less convenient when driving. Dashboard mounted systems replace the car's factory stereo and sound system. This is the most common mounting method. Some systems are designed to be mounted in a car's glove compartment or under a seat. They provide more security, because they are more difficult for thieves to access, but can be more difficult to operate while driving.    Purchase a multi-year warranty on your car audio system in case it gets damaged or stolen. Choose a warranty that includes all parts of the system, is several years and costs a one-time fee rather than an annual charge.    High performance car stereo systems often come with optional anti-theft features like removable face plates or password encoding that prevents the system from being operated without a password when disconnected from the car's battery. These anti theft options will cost extra, but will help protect your investment.    Get your car audio system through a business that specializes in high-end automotive audio systems and installing them. These experts will be more knowledgeable about options that suit your car and price range than if you shopped at an electronics or department store.    Car audio systems start at around $150 for a simple interface, which is the faceplate that houses the radio and CD player components. Additional speakers and sub woofers cost $200 and up. Know how much you can spend when you shop and get a system that fits that range or that allows you to get a starter system that allow you to add woofers, tweeters and other components.	Decide between touch-screen and push-button displays. Decide if you want a docking station. Consider Bluetooth compatibility. Consider recordable CD capabilities. Know where you want to mount the system. Evaluate warranty options. Add anti-theft options. Shop at professional car audio stores. Set your price range. Finished.
Unlike the normal clothes sewing process, sewing soft toys often requires the sewing of layers using fabric that can be quite thick, such as fur, felt, corduroy or thick cotton.; , This will help it to cope with the additional strain.  Do your stitching more slowly when sewing through thicker fabric or through felt. This will help to ensure that the strain on the machine is less and that you don't end up with bunched up fabric clogging the needles.	Use machine needles that are thick enough to cope with layers of fabric. Oil your sewing machine regularly during the making of each soft toy. Slow down!
Removing some of the fruit will help the fruit that remains be larger and tastier, as well as preventing the branch from falling under the weight. When the fruit begins to emerge, remove the smallest fruits and leave about four inches between the healthy fruits you want to keep.  Different varieties peak at different times between August and October. Learn what your apple variety should look and taste like at its peak. The apples should be easy to pluck from the tree; it shouldn't be necessary to yank them off when they're ripe.   In general, the apples' background color should no longer be green (unless you're growing a green variety). Apples that are falling from the tree in the slightest breeze may be overripe, so act quickly!  , They keep best at a temperature between 32 and 45 degrees F. They will stay fresh at this temperature for up to six months. Check the apple bin frequently and throw out any rotten apples. Apples can also be preserved by making apple jam, apple butter, or apple sauce.	Thin fruit when the crop is heavy. Harvest the apples at their peak. Store apples in a cool, dark place.
Make two lists. The first list is for the stuff you want for your living room. The second list is for the stuff you actually need.; , If you don't own a pickup truck, find a friend or family member who does. Offer the friend a pizza and a 6-pack (around $20) or some other favor in return.  You'll be shocked how many people are moving, or buying new couches at any given time.   Ask people to check their garage, attic and other areas for furniture they no longer want.  A lot of people with post a CURB ALERT before they put a chair or table in the trash.  Photos, paintings, and other unique items will spruce up the place quickly.	Know the space you are working with. Get some transportation help. Ask your friends, your entire family and all of their friends if they know anyone getting rid of furniture. Look at websites like www.craigslist.org for free and cheap furniture. Talk to your more artistic friends about giving you their work.
Specially-formulated de-icing fluid is available at most auto shops, especially if you live in an area with cold winters. However, if you don't have any de-icer on hand or you just want to save money, it's not hard to make your own. Follow the simple instructions below:To make your own de-icer, pour rubbing alcohol into a clean, dry spray bottle. Add a few drops of dish soap. Screw the lid on, then invert several times to mix.  Whether you bought de-icer or made your own, you'll use it the same way. Spray your de-icer directly on to the icy parts of your window, then allow it to soak in briefly. You shouldn't need to wait more than a minute or two - the more de-icer you use, the less time you'll have to wait.  Use a plastic scraper, a gloved hand, or another tool to scrape the ice away. You should find that it comes off of your window much quicker and easier than it normally would, saving you time overall. If needed, re-apply your de-icer to difficult spots as you scrape.   In commercial concentrations, rubbing alcohol has a very low freezing point, so it's usually OK to leave your de-icer in the car unless you're expecting temperatures of -20 F (-29 C) or lower.	Buy a commercial de-icer or make your own. Spray your de-icer on the window. Scrape as normal.
For this technique, you will need to use craft embossing stamps, so you will also need to plan a design based on the embossing stamps you're able to find.   You should be able to find embossing stamps at any major craft store. This technique works best if you want to engrave letters onto a leather bracelet, especially since letter embossing stamps are so easy to find. You can use embossing stamps to spell out names, inspirational words, or short quotes and sayings.You could also opt for a design involving numbers, simple shapes, or simple images. Keep in mind that simplicity is key here. If you want to create a more elaborate design, you will need to use the freehand method. Before purchasing embossing stamps, make sure that the stamp face is no wider than the width of the leather bracelet you plan to use. Note that plain leather crafting bracelets are also available at most craft stores.; , Determine how far apart you want each stamped image to be before you start any engraving.   Lay the leather bracelet flat on top of your working surface. Line the embossing stamps up side by side above the bracelet. Move and position the stamps as needed until the stamps are positioned evenly over the bracelet length. If you cannot get the design to fit, you may need smaller embossing stamps or a smaller design. It can be a good idea to lightly mark the left edge of each stamp on the leather bracelet using chalk. This chalk should be wiped away after completing the engraving.  Thoroughly wipe both sides of the leather bracelet with a mildly damp sponge. The leather needs to be moist, but it should not be soaked.   Thoroughly saturate the sponge under running water, then squeeze out the excess moisture. The remaining dampness should be enough to moisten the leather bracelet. The moisture weakens the leather, which makes it easier to emboss and engrave. Too much moisture can cause the leather to dry out and crack, however.  Place the bracelet down on a hard working surface and carefully position your first stamp in its proper spot.   Make sure that the "right" side of the bracelet is facing up. Engravings made with embossing stamps will not be deep enough to show through to the other side of the bracelet. You must use a hard working surface. If you use a soft working surface, there will not be enough pressure to engrave the leather when you strike the stamp. If you marked the placement of each stamp with chalk, make sure that the first chalk line lines up with the left edge of the stamp again as you position it in place.  Hold the stamp securely with your non-dominant hand and strike the end of the stamp with a mallet using your dominant hand.   Strike the stamp one to three times using considerable force. When you strike the stamp multiple times, make sure that you are holding it in the same position each time. Otherwise, your final design could be skewed and uneven. After lifting the stamp away, you should see the impression of the stamp design engraved into the leather.  Place the remaining stamps in their proper place and strike them with the mallet. Work with the stamps one at a time.   Follow the design layout previously planned and make sure that the stamp designs are spaced apart evenly. If you marked the left edge of each stamp with chalk, make sure that the left edges of each stamp line up with their corresponding lines before tapping them into place. Take your time. Rushing through the process will increase the risk of error.  Set the bracelet aside and allow any remaining dampness to dry. Once the leather dries, the engraved images should set and the bracelet should be ready to wear.   Wipe away any remaining chalk lines with your damp sponge before the bracelet fully dries. If you want to decorate the leather further with dyes or embellishments, do so after the leather has been engraved.	Pick a design. Determine the design placement. Wipe the leather with a damp sponge. Place the first stamp. Tap the stamp with a mallet. Repeat with the remaining stamps. Let the bracelet dry.
Therefore, some of the things you do to break in tap shoes might seem similar to these tips.; , This is to prevent a lot of blisters from coming. You are still going to get blisters, just not as much as you would without the Vaseline. , Just do maybe five to ten in a row. Sevens work too, if you would rather. These exercises will help increase the wideness of your hard shoe.  Make sure you rub at the sides and the front and backs.  Walk up and down the stairs about three to five times. Remember to walk at a very fast pace.  Once again, every Irish step dancer knows what this movement is. Repeatedly, do these exercises about ten to fifteen times.  You can leave it overnight. This will help make it easier to go en pointe.  You could do any one you want, as long as it will make your shoes feel "worn." This will probably give you blisters, but it's essential.  Once you are comfortable standing in three-quarters pointe (with just the balls of your feet on the ground), you should begin working towards a toe stand, if they are allowed for your age group. Begin by holding onto a surface at waist height such as a desk or a sturdy chair. Go into full pointe on one foot and pick the other up off the ground while using the desk for support. (It's okay if you have to bend your knee, but as your hard shoes become more broken in, try to straighten it more and more.) Meanwhile, repeatedly tap the heel of your standing foot with the toe of your standing foot. This will help give your shoe the flexibility you need to do a toe stand. Switch feet and do the same exercise on the other foot.	First things first, a hard shoe is like a tap dancing shoe, but it is a little more expensive and instead of metal it has fiber-glass or resin tips. Apply some Vaseline to the inside edge of your hard shoe where your heel will be. Walk around.Since your hard shoe is now on, walk up and down stairs, walk around the house, but do not walk outside, the concrete will ruin the leather sole.  , Start doing hop two threes.Every Irish step dancer know what a hop two three is. If your feet are starting to hurt, take a break and start rubbing the inside of your hard shoe. After rubbing, apply some more Vaseline, and put your hard shoes back on, because it is time to do more exercises. Hop, hop back, hop back two three four. Bend your hard shoe in half and put it under the couch. Once you have done everything here, try to dance. Toe stand practice.
Take measurements of all the windows that you will cover with vinyl blinds.   Use a tape measure to get the length of the window. Start at the top of the window, and pull the tape measure down to the bottom of the window. Use a tape measure to get the width of the window. Start at the left of the window and pull the tape measure to the right until you get to the end of the window.; ,   Choose vertical blinds if you are covering a long window or a sliding door. Vertical blinds also work well in offices. Select horizontal blinds for a softer, more modern look. Vinyl blinds that hang horizontally are used most often on windows in homes.  Most horizontal vinyl blinds come with slats that are half an inch (1.27 cm) or 2 inches (5 cm).   Buy blinds with a larger slat width for extra privacy and to keep the sun out. Look for a smaller slat size for more texture and style.  Most vinyl blinds are available in a shade of white. You can find different colors to match your décor and curtains, however.  Look for vinyl blinds in your window measurements at home improvement stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot.   Check department stores, such as Target, Sears and Walmart. Shop online for a larger selection and lower prices. You may be able to find additional options for vinyl blinds online. You can also compare prices.  If you will be hanging the blinds yourself, make sure you understand how to do it.   Check the packaging for instructions. If you cannot find them, ask a sales associate.  You might get the blinds home and decide you do not like them. Make sure you can bring them back.  If you have a window that is an unusual size, you might need to have blinds made for you. Talk to an associate in a store, or check online sites such as Blinds.com.	Measure your windows. Decide if vertical or horizontal blinds will work best. Consider your slat width. Choose a color. Shop around. Read the installation instructions. Ask about return policies. Consider custom vinyl blinds.
While a radio will be the most important part of your shopping trip, there are some other thing you'll want to look into picking up as well.   The radio itself. Most CB radios are 4 Watts and under by default. A microphone should come with the radio package.An antenna. The antenna is the most important part of your radio's setup.Fibreglass antennae are often preferable because they are tunable. A SWR meter. A SWR meter will help you measure the radio's output. This is a vital part of tuning your antenna to the radio. Coaxial cables. A coaxial cable is needed to connect the antenna to the radio. Another cable may be needed if you're hooking it up to an SWR meter. Batteries. Many CB radios are battery powered (hand-held). When you purchase a CB radio, check what type of batteries it uses and purchase a supply of them.; , A SWR (Standing Wave Radio) reader can be hooked up like an adaptor between the antenna and the radio itself.Throughout your tunings, you'll want to check this meter periodically. Generally speaking, you'll want the SWR to read as low as possible. High ratings will seriously limit your radio's performance, and possibly risk even damaging it.   Generally speaking, a SWR reading of 2.0:1 (or lower) across all channels is acceptable., Antennae are typically very easy to mount on a car. You'll maximize your range if you put it up on the highest place possible. Most antennae are magnetically-based, which makes them a case of sticking it where you want. Once you mount the antenna, link the antenna to your radio with a coaxial cable.   You can add a quick-release mount to attach the antenna onto the car with. This makes it a lot easier to attach and remove the antenna at will., Tuning a CB radio means fixing the antenna. Sometimes, the antenna will need to be adjusted to get the optimal signal. Most fibreglass antennae have detachable segments at the top to allow for extensions, so antennae can be lengthened that way. Antennae can also be shorted by sawing the antenna down as needed.If Channel 1 on your SWR is greater than Channel 40, it means your antenna is too short. Conversely, if Channel 40 is greater than 1, it means it's too long. When setting up the antenna, you'll want your SWR levels below 2.0. You'll also want Channels 1 and 40 to read identical to one another.(Edit: Using an amplifier with a CB is HIGHLY ILLEGAL.)  , From there, you can ensure your frequencies are accurate by giving a Channel a test-run.  Because models differ, the owner’s manual will help you identify parts for adjustments. Some suggestions to peak your radio are below, but only try them if you’re electronically adept and you have an older CB. If you're trying anything advanced with the CB radio, you should first make sure you know all of the basics.   If your CB radio has been manufactured within the last few years, you won’t need to peak it. Newer models don’t have the drift and adjustment problems of older CBs. Any modification to newer models, such as producing higher wattage, usually puts the CB into illegal territory where the FCC is concerned.  Properly testing and tuning a radio should have as little signal noise around it as possible. Open areas also give CB radio the best possible range.   Everyone must remain inside with the doors closed while you take readings. On the other hand, if you have a base CB unit, test it in place.  It can be linked up via coaxial cable via the antenna input.  The modulation should be adjustable via the body of the CB radio. Tweaking the modulation is a good way of maximizing power but you'll only want to up it to a certain degree. Make sure the sound of the radio isn't being distorted by the extent of your modulation.  Squelch refers to a background noise-cancelling function of a CB radio.Squelch can be adjusted via a knob on CB radios with the function included. Adjust the squelch to a point where the noise is minimized but the rest of your sound is relatively untouched.   RF gain is a more modern alternative to squelch radio, and it serves roughly the same purpose., Peaking the particulars of your CB radio are only really recommended if you have a lot of experience with radio equipment. Otherwise, it can save a lot of trouble to take it to a store. From there, a specialist can work out the kinks and get it up to its peak efficiency.   Check the web for reviews of the store before giving them your radio. It has been reported that some radio stores will fall short when it comes to handling CB radios., If you know someone else with a CB radio, you should enlist their help. Tune into the same channel as your friend, and try to have a conversation. From the other's person's responses, you should get a reasonable idea what your transmissions are like. From there, experiment with different ranges and channels.   Ironically, having someone on the other line via cellphone and communicating that way can be helpful if you're still in the midst of troubleshooting your radio setup.  Even though CB is only used by a select group of people at this point, there's still a dynamic culture, complete with its own jargon and inside jokes.   Be aware of CB "trolls" that occupy radio channels. They use the anonymity of radio to lash offensive slurs and rile people up for amusement.Channel 9 is declared by the FCC as the official channel for emergencies. If you want to contact with anyone on an official basis, you should read up on some of the codes. They are sometimes specific to a certain region, so it may take specific researching on your part.  Internet radio is also available, and potentially transmits much further. It should also be mentioned that CB radio lots its popularity with the advent of cellphones. If you're needing to communicate for largely practical reasons, you should rely on a phone or the internet.	Purchase the basic supplies.Although CB radios are no longer in fashion, you can purchase one at most electronics hardware stores and truck stops. Hook up your SWR reader. Set up an antenna. Alter your antenna as needed. Test your radio on a live Channel.First, check your SWR radio to ensure your Channels have equal output. Refer to the manual. Find an open area.Drive your vehicle to a large open area, away from buildings and trees, to test your CB radio. Link up your SWR meter.A SWR meter is necessary to check the output of your radio. Maximize the modulation without distorting the voice. Adjust the squelch range. Take your radio to a shop for peaking. Test your radio with another CB radio. Learn the CB codes and lingo.Once you get the hang of using your radio, you should "peak" your behaviour on the air. Consider an alternative to upgrading your CB radio.Some modern radios are much stronger by default than CB.
If you don't have a lot of floor space for storage furniture, you can easily install floating shelves on your walls. Decide what you'd like to hang, so you can purchase shelving that makes sense for the items. For example, if you want to store shoes, you can install long strips of shelving that you can hang the shoes from.If you don't have space for a bedside table, consider installing two floating cabinet shelves on top of each other. You can install them in the corner next to your bed, so you have somewhere to put your things. For example, you could use floating bedside storage for a small lamp, a clock, your cell phone, and a pair of glasses.  Purchase a decorative ladder that you can lean against one of your bedroom walls. Storage ladders usually have wide steps and are only half of a ladder, so they must be put up against a wall. You can store clothing, blankets, books, plants, or accessories on the ladder.   You can find sleek, minimal storage ladders or rustic wooden ladders. Try to find one that matches the look of your bedroom. Look for decorative ladders at home improvement stores, home goods stores, or online.  You can easily create storage space on the wall near your headboard. Purchase small shelving cabinets and install them around your headboard. This is a great way to get storage, especially if you don't have room for a nightstand.Consider installing shelving along the perimeter of your room. Install the shelving on the walls about 12 inches (30.5 cm) below the ceiling.  Measure your windows and purchase shelving that will fit directly below them. If you have small windows, you may be able to fit a large cabinet or dresser below the window. If you have large windows, you may only be able to fit short storage cubes. Try not to block the windows, so your room can still get natural light.   Look for storage benches that you could fit under the window. This will give you somewhere to sit and a place to store things.	Install floating shelves. Prop a ladder against the wall for shelving. Build shelving around your headboard. Place shelving units below the windows.
These are: a shoebox lid, sand or soil, water, a small container to hold the water (a small tea light candle holder is a good choice), pebbles or small rocks, a bridge, fake or real moss, a comb or mini rake, and any additional items you'd like to add, just remembering that simplicity is important for a Zen garden.; , If you're going to keep this Zen garden for a while, lay out clear wrap under the sand. , A traditional Zen garden would have the rocks placed in the corners. ,, If you would like, put the bridge over the water.  Use it to ponder life's mysteries and to keep yourself calm.	Obtain the items needed. Take the shoebox lid and the sand. Pour the sand into the shoebox lid and level it out so that it is even across the shoebox lid.  , Place the rock in the sand, wherever you'd like it to sit. Add the moss and anything else that you have to put in your Zen garden.  , Use the mini rake or comb to make patterns in the sand.  , Put the water container on the sand and add the water. Display the Zen garden on your desk.
Make sure that it is truly funny. If you hear giggling then that is a sure tell sign someone is in there.; , Clothes generally create no noise but air conditioners can mask the sound. In a nice, quiet, room, you can hear the person in your closet breathing.  Keep in mind that someone inside your closet generally will have a hard time closing the door.  If not, try looking under the closet to see feet. This step should be taken with caution, as the person inside may notice and pop out at you. But remember, as the person outside, you have the best control over the doors!  , This high-tech technique is nearly sure to find anyone hiding inside.  Make sure that it makes a noise locking it. Then fake closing you door ( open the door, count to 2, then close it ). If someone is inside there, they would be freaking out because they can't get out.  While this approach seems rather basic, it may catch your hider off-guard!  ,, Then, using a hand (or pole), poke your clothes or any hiding spaces gently to check for people. If you find none, congratulations, your closet is clear.	Say something funny. Listen for any rustling or breathing from the closet. Look for any signs that your closet has been opened or tampered with, generally a badly closed door or something moved out of the way. Turn on the light (or use a flashlight) to peer inside the closet before opening it if your closet has a slit in it. If you have a temperature gun and your closet has cracks, fire that inside and look for temperature spikes. Lock your closet somehow. Ask "Is anyone inside of my closet?", Slowly open the closet door, having a good grip on the handle and using your foot to prevent the door from opening far.  , Repeat step 7 until the door is fully open.
If it has a lot of dried ink in between the characters or lines, it is harder to read the printed image. If you are unsure just by looking at the stamp, do a test stamp on a piece of scrap paper, then check the document imprint.   Dried ink that is flat and clean on the stamp is a color stain, not a dirty stamp. It is only if the ink has built up and interferes with your stamping that it's a real problem. , Hold the stamp by the handle. Run the rubber image under the water until the water runs clear. It's okay to see black, red, or another color of ink while rinsing the stamp.  Use a paper towel to dry it completely.   Clean the sink after this, to remove any ink stains.	Check the condition of your stamp. Find a basin with hot, running water.  , Let the water run until it gets hot. Shake the stamp until it's dry enough for you.
Using dirty, dull pruning shears to make cuts on a tree leaves it prone to disease. Make a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water. Dip your shears in the solution and rinse them off with hot water. Once your shears are sterilized, dry them off with a clean towel. It might take a few extra minutes, but it's worth it to ensure your tree won't be harmed by the pruning process. Make sure your shears are sharp, so that they don't damage the wood on your cherry tree. Sterilize your pruning shears every time you prune your tree.; , Before you prune the tree, measure it with measuring tape or a yardstick to see if it's tall enough. If the sapling is short, wait until it's well over 30 inches (76.2 cm) before inches before heading it. Waiting until the tree is more established before you cut the top will ensure that the cut won't weaken the tree., Cutting the top of the tree is called heading. Use your sharpened shears to cut the tree with your to 24 to 36 inches (61.0 to 91.4 cm) in height, on a 45-degree angle. Heading the tree will reduce the potential for disease and rot. Do this within the first year or two of planting the tree so you can control the shape the tree takes as it grows.If you wait until spring, the tree will have developed buds and the energy that went into bud formation gets wasted. Making the cut before buds have formed allows the tree to use that energy to produce healthy branches.	Sterilize and sharpen your pruning shears. Measure your cherry tree. Cut the top of the central trunk in the fall or winter.
Also, you will need to consider the plant size as you may need to use multiple watering devices per potted plant or planted area.   Add up the number of potted plants versus in-ground plants that will need attention. If you need a self-watering device for in-ground plants, you may want to consider using a plastic instead of glass bottle for safety reasons.      ; , It’s very important to clean the hot sauce bottle thoroughly as you don’t want any spicy juice to get into the soil.   Pop off the top (the top that allows the hot sauce to slowly leak from the bottle) and fill the bottle with hot soapy water. Rinse and allow to dry.       Consider removing the bottle label so it doesn’t soak into the soil while the hot sauce bottle is doing its job.  If you want to feed your plants while they are being watered, add a small amount of plant food to the bottle first, then add the water. Replace the pop top lid and shake.  The bottle should be placed near enough to the plant so the water can seep down to the roots, but not so close so that it damages the plant.  Plunge the bottle into the soil, while at the same time removing your finger.	Identify plants that must be watered/cared for while you are away. Empty and clean out a hot sauce bottle. Fill the bottle with water. Identify an area near the plant to place the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down, while plugging the opening with your finger. Finished.
Start by standing with both of your feet together. Then, try to kick your left foot high enough that it is at about a 45 degree angle to the ground. You will need to balance on your right foot, which can take practice. Be gentle as you first start learning, and understand that it may take some practice before you can comfortably bring your leg all the way up to the correct height.Both knees should be as straight as possible as you kick.; , Firmly plant it flat on the ground so the whole foot makes contact at once; do not let the heel hit before the rest of the foot. Planting your foot does not mean slamming it on the ground. Simply make sure that you have secure footing, with the toe pointed forward. For most versions of the goose step, it is incorrect to bring the foot down with excessive force.  Keep both knees straight, and kick your right foot up. The goal is to get it at about a 45 degree angle from the ground for most goose steps; however, when you are just beginning, kicking that high may cause you to hurt yourself. Don’t push beyond what you’re capable of.   Certain countries, such as North Korea, use a goose step that has a higher kick than most other countries., Make sure you march with a deliberate, even rhythm. Try going outside or into a long hallway to practice to be sure that you have enough space to practice repetitions of the kicks.  For example, you may wish to simply tilt your rifle forward 45 degrees (at a 135 degree angle with the ground) while marching. Otherwise, hold your arms at your sides.   Different countries have different arm movements for their goose step, so there may be a unique movement depending on the country whose goose step you want to imitate. The best way to imitate the arm movements of your country of interest is to do a YouTube search and watch a video of the soldiers marching.  Goose stepping boots should have some weight, and should cover your ankles. This is to allow the ankles to turn with the boot, instead of the top of the boot getting in the way of the turning ankle.   The hobnailed jackboot is one type of boot that you could try. Germans call this book “Marschstiefel,” which means “marching boot.” These boots come to your mid-calf or higher, have no laces, and have a leather sole.  It will help you coordinate your moves as you march to the beat of the music. Try searching some of these terms on YouTube to find music: Königgrätzer Marsch, Preußenmarsch (translates to "Prussian March"), Tannenberg Marsch, Unsere Garde Marsch, Yorckscher Marsch., After learning a slow, ceremonial step, you may want to practice faster, more difficult versions of the march. You can familiarize yourself with the march you wish to learn by watching videos of soldiers performing it. Pay close attention to the angles of the legs, the way the feet are planted on the ground, and the movement of the arms.  North Korea’s version of the goose step is bouncy, forceful, and very difficult to do. To try this goose step, you must keep your head straight, and lock your arms at a 90 degree angle. When kicking, try to raise your leg to almost horizontal to the ground. Then, slam your foot down to the ground with force. As you do, the other foot should erupt into the air, creating a bouncing or trotting effect., In English-speaking countries, the goose step is often associated with dictatorship, blind obedience, or with the Nazi regime of World War II. With that being said, the goose step is still used in many countries around the world. If you practice your goose step in public, be aware that people may ask you questions and some may seem offended.	Kick up your left foot without bending your knee. Bring your left foot back down on the ground. Kick up with your right foot immediately. Repeat kicking up your left and right feet. Hold your arms straight, or pretend to hold a rifle. Wear the proper boots for goose stepping. Play marching music while you are practicing. Learn more difficult versions of the goose step. Try the North Korean goose step. Be mindful of the cultural stigma.
Abrasive blasting (e.g., sand blasting, bead blasting, etc.) is a process by which materials are abraded with a spray of fine-grain powder or tiny pellets. Often, auto body shops and construction companies will have access to such devices. Prolonged abrasive blasting can remove an object's chrome finish, though touch-up work may need to be done on the object's hard-to-reach areas afterwords.   You may want to use a relatively fine-grain medium (for instance, 400-grit sand) when blasting your chrome to prevent damage to the underlying metal. Note that the airborne dust and sediment produced by chipping off tiny pieces of chrome while using an abrasive blaster can be toxic, so use appropriate face/mouth protection.; , Ultrasonic cleaners are special devices that use sound waves to clean delicate, difficult-to-clean items like jewelry. Ultrasonic cleaners can even remove chrome in some situations (especially when the chrome has already been loosened with another method). Place chrome items in the ultrasonic cleaner's basket and submerge them in a cleaning solution (often ordinary water), then allow the cleaner to run according to its instructions.   Using a solvent that can dissolve chrome (for instance, bleach, as noted above) rather than water can enhance the chrome-removing power of an ultrasonic cleaner. However, only do so if the solution you use will not corrode the cleaner or otherwise react with it in any way. For instance, as noted below, lye will react with aluminum containers. Note that, while ultrasound machines come in a variety of sizes, most will only hold relatively small items, such as jewelry, lug-nuts, tools, ornaments, etc.	Use an abrasive blaster. Use an ultrasonic cleaner.
Like many theme parks, Rainbow's End is busy during the school holidays. Christmas Day is the one day the park is closed but you can expect it to be busy throughout the summer months. Located at 2 Clist Crescent, Manukau, Auckland, some of the park's attractions are weather dependent so if you want to visit in July or August, remember some rides may not be running due to snow, rain or high winds. The park is open from 10:00am to 5:00pm daily.; , The rides and are within the park as a whole or in Kidz Kingdom.  Events occur frequently, if not regularly. Matariki is recognised, sometimes with celebratory family tickets.  You'll enjoy your day more if you don't feel like you've missed out. If you're keen to go on rides that don't have lots of seats, like the karts and the log flume, get to those early in the day and work your way toward the rides with more capacity such as Invader or Stratosfear.  Publicised as the park's scariest ride it is 30 metres high at the highest point, has a 360 degree swing angle and will get the blood rushing to your head as you spin upside down with your fellow 29 riders.  This ride is a combination of a roundabout, and roller coaster! You'll spin around whilst travelling along a 80 metre track at up to 70 km/h (43.5 mph).  At 18 stories to the top, you will have plenty of time to think about how there’s only one way down! You may of seen this ride on the popular comedy show Jono and Ben. They often attempt to interview celebrities, with varying success, on this ride.  18 metres high with three types of rotation, this will put you in a spin. Pick your partner carefully as you'll be sitting side by side, isolated from the other 22 riders.  Try the Corkscrew Roller coaster. At a maximum of 45 kilometres per hour you'll drop, loop and go thorough not one but two corkscrews]]  , At Rainbow's End these are: Log Flume Gold Rush Roller Coaster Ride Pirate Ship Dodgems Scorpion Cars (Go karts)  ,, There's Comfy Land and Tiny Tots for those who like to just play not ride and check out the Dixie Chickens Show if you just want to relax and watch something for a while.  Factor in transport costs, eating at the park, purchasing souvenirs and accommodation if you don't live nearby or need to travel home more than a few hours.  Check the website for family and group deals. Often, you can save money not paying for tickets at the gate and you will save buying online.  Remember branded food, packets of chips for example, are not permitted, unless they are for park guests with special dietary requirements. Make your own sandwiches, pies, sausage rolls etc or take your favourite brands out of the original packaging.	Plan your visit. Understand that whilst Ranbow's End is New Zealand's premier theme park, it's also NZ's only theme park and nothing like internationally recognised parks such Disney World. Check the park's website or local media to find out about special events. Decide which attractions you most want to visit. Ride Stratosfear. Take a turn on Invader. Try Fearfall. Ride Power Surge. Roll and coast!, Try out the exciting and slightly less extreme rides. Drive the Bumper Boats or Family Karts, see a show in the Motion Master or see if you can get lucky at the Future-tainment Arcade or Crazy Sideshows.  , Remember If you've got under the age of eight to entertain, they'll likely love the Space Shuttles, Carwash Convoy, Carousel and other 'kiddie' rides and attractions. Determine your budget. Look for advanced deals. Take your own food and drinks if you wish. Keep in mind the park offers birthday party packages, conferences and meeting options, team building packages as well as both night and day packages.
,,, Loop the ribbon over and sew the other ribbon end to the other end of the elastic so that the elastic completes the ribbon loop.  The elastic section should allow the ribbon to lay smoothly over your sleeve, yet hold it in place. Adjust as necessary.	Measure ribbon to fit around your arm.  , Cut it to length.  , Fold the ends under and stitch them under.  , Sew a short length of elastic onto one end of the ribbon. Slid up over your arm.
The flowers on your orchid should be dead before you prune the spike. To cause as little potential damage as possible, you should also wait until the top of the spike shows signs of yellowing.   Note that this type of pruning should only be done to mature orchids that have reached a minimum foliage height of 12 inches (30.5 cm).  Look at the bracts or beige bands running down the spike, each positioned roughly 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart. The inactive bud should be located just below the widest bract.   This bottom bract should widen into the shape of a shield. When you prune the orchid just above this bud, you cut away a portion of the spike containing hormones that prevent the bud from growing. In doing so, you allow the bud to begin growing again, and you may see a new spike growing within a few weeks. This spike has the potential to flower again.  Grab the spike with your non-dominant hand and keep it upright and steady. With your dominant hand and a sharp cutting tool, cut the spike 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the wide, shield-shaped bract.	Wait for the flower to die. Locate the inactive bud. Make the cut.
Leaf through pattern books or look on the internet.; , See which look good together and which don't.  Magazines are great because they feature current styles and they have photos to give you ideas. Think about how that sweater would look in a different color.  They are great resources.  For example, Lion Brand Yarn and Crystal Palace Yarns have tons of free patterns.  They would be happy to help you find a pattern to use yarn that they sell.  Your library has a wealth of books available with current styles. If you think you can't finish a project in the time you have it checked out, simply photocopy the directions.  The search engine available there has revolutionized the process of finding patterns--one can search by type of pattern, specific yarn line, gauge, and much more.  This is the best way to find blog posts with great free patterns, other than Googling. Here are a few:   Knitting on the Net Knitting Pattern Central The Daily Knitter Craftown.com Knitting-and.com  , For example, there's this list of free online knitting patterns from Wendy Knits blog.	Decide what you want to knit. Buy and try different yarn colors. Check out knitting magazines at your local bookstore. Check out online knitting magazines, such as Knitty.com's archives. Look at yarn websites as they feature patterns that show off their yarn the best. Go to your local yarn store. Check the library. Consider joining Ravelry. Search through online depositories of knitting patterns for the perfect one. Begin to compile a list of blogs you like that you might check back regularly for new patterns.
You will need enough metal to form a bomb casing, explosive lenses, enough enriched uranium or plutonium to produce (at least) a 10 kiloton explosion, and a rocket, launch pad and satellite to get the stuff into space. oh, almost forgot - you'll need a radio detonator for the explosives, with enough range to send a signal into space., The explosion from the bomb will create a very big, high-power EMP. Connect the bomb to the detonator.,,, Make sure that any space stations and other satellites and stuff are outside the blast radius., The gamma rays from the explosion will interact with the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field and generate an EMP. If you build a big enough bomb, the EMP can affect an entire continent.	Obtain the components. Use the first three components to build an atom bomb.Put the bomb on the satellite.Put the satellite on the rocket and launch the whole thing into a low-earth orbit. Maneuver the satellite into position. Detonate the bomb.
Once all the flowers have dropped for the season, the trumpet vine begins to enter dormancy, making it the perfect time to trim it down. Trimming the branches in the autumn also prevents seed pods from dropping and starting new vines.  Use sharp pruning shears to cut away old stems that have become spindly or weak. These stems make your trumpet vine look more ragged and do not produce as much vibrant growth as newer stems. As such, woody stems should be removed first.  Since many trumpet vines are trained to climb a vertical surface, like a trellis, you will likely want to trim away lateral shoots that would produce outward branches. On the other hand, if you want the trumpet vine to crawl over the ground or another flat surface, prune shoots at the top of the vine to encourage outward, rather than upward, growth.  Even if you want the vine to climb upward, leaving the top branches alone will only cause the plant to direct all its energy to upward growth, creating a scraggly appearance. Cut the top stems down to 10 inches (25.4 cm) to encourage new, fuller growth. Focus on the heaviest sections of growth, creating a uniform appearance throughout the length of the vine.  For instance, if you want an outward or horizontal covering, the remaining buds should be lateral buds that face outward. Likewise, if you want the vine to climb upward, the vines should be at the tip of the branches.  If you remove much more than that, you run the risk of shocking the vine rather than encouraging it. A shocked vine will produce very little new growth.  If new suckers have developed over the summer, dig them up and cut them away before they have the chance to take root.	Wait until the vine finishes flowering. Remove woody stems. Cut to shape the vine. Trim down top branches. Leave at least three to four buds.The buds should be on stems that are facing in the direction you want your vine to grow in. Only remove about 1/3 of the wood. Trim the base of the vine.
Depending on the season's rainfall, the track may be hard or soft. The additional water will make it a little slippery, a lot slippery, downright muddy, or a mix of the three.; , No speeding, no passing, no bumping; just drive around. This is a good time to get used to the bumps and the bank on the curves. Hit the gas hard a few times to see how easy wheelspin is, but don't get out of control.  You'll get three or four laps at full speed with no other traffic around. The fastest qualifiers will compete for trophies. Everyone else will just run for fun the rest of the night. This is the time to push your car as hard as you can without spinning out. Find the muddy parts, the hard, dry parts and the slippery parts.  Make your way around the first couple of laps without bumping any other cars.  You want to make your path through the turn as straight as possible to avoid scrubbing off speed.  Maintain this slide through the turn by steering to the opposite direction than the turn. Keep the front wheels in the direction you want the car to go, regardless of where the front of the car is pointing.  If there's not a wall between the track and the infield, there will certainly be a ridge of dirt. Bumping your left front wheel against this will affect traction on that wheel, and you could lose control. If you bump the infield, move the car a bit towards the outside.  Other drivers will try to spin you by bumping your left rear just behind the rear axle with their right front (known by police as the PIT maneuver). This will cause you to spin out, lose position, and possibly crash. If you know there is a driver in position to spin you this way, don't slide as much, if at all.  Doing so enables the other driver to push you to the wall or the infield, respectively. Getting pushed to the infield is much worse than going to the wall. The infield, if not walled off, is a complete mud bog that you'll spend many laps trying to get out of, if you can get out at all.  Example: if you can only get up enough speed to get high in first gear, but not shift to second, leave the car in first, not drive. The engine will help slow the car down when you brake for turns, and your acceleration will be more immediately responsive going into the straightaway.  If someone has lost a bumper on the outside of the backstretch, remember to stay to the inside. You may also be able to use debris to your advantage by coercing other drivers into it.  When you see a crash, think about what you're going to do when you come around the track again, because the wreck will probably still be there, and could be worse. Consider a wreck to be a giant piece of debris, and use it to your advantage as well.  The key to winning is finishing, and the key to finishing is keeping your car moving. Drive aggressively, but also be very calculating. If you're not in good track position to muscle someone out of the way, bide your time.	Watch the track crew water down the track. Pull onto the track with the rest of the participants to drive slowly, packing the track down. Participate in the qualifying laps. The track will be very crowded during racing, so be cool at first until the pack spreads out and thins out. As much as possible, stay to the outside in the straightaways and move to the inside through the turns. When going through the turns, get the car into a slide, kicking the rear out toward the outside wall. When turning, be careful of the infield. Remember that you are most vulnerable when turning. Don't pass on the outside during turns, and don't pass on the inside on the straightaways. Drive with the transmission in the lowest gear possible. Keep a keen eye out for debris on the track. Plan ahead. By the time the race is over, twenty-five laps or so, there may be only two or three cars still running at all, the rest having returned to the pits or sitting dead on the track.
When you're first starting out, it's best to stick with one or two products. In candles, making container candles is probably the simplest, but you can also make mold candles or taper candles., Waxes come in several main groups. Which group you choose is mostly based on preference.   One group is paraffin, which is a by-product of petroleum. You can find it in a variety of melting points, depending on what type of candles you are making. For instance, you need a higher melting point for tapers than you do for container candles.Another type of wax is beeswax. Beeswax is a product that bees make, so it has a natural, light honey smell. Some people prefer this wax because it is all-natural, though others will mix beeswax with other waxes for their candles.A third category of waxes is vegetable waxes, where soy is probably the most popular. One benefit of soy wax is it is pure white, and it also doesn't shrink up when you pour it, which means you don't have to pour wax more than once. Bayberry wax is also in this category., One of the simplest ways to learn how to make candles is to take a class in your community. You may be able to find one with your local parks and recreation department or even at your local community college. However, you can also find a wide variety of tutorials online. In fact, you'll likely be able to find all you need to know online if that is your preference.You can also check out books from your local library about candle-making.  Before you start selling, you need to take time to build up your skill. Try working a little bit each day on your business, starting with practicing a bit each day.  When you're first starting your business, it can help to have a lawyer on your side. She can help you file the appropriate paperwork and ensure you have the correct licenses when you start your business.  If you can't decide on a name at first, just pick anything. You are allowed to do business under a different name if you file it later as "Doing business under." In other words, if you don't like the name you choose, you can always change it later., If you intend to keep your business on a small scale, you have the main options of sole proprietorship and limited liability company (LLC). A sole proprietorship is intended for a one-person company, but you are personally responsible for all the debts of the company. On the upside, it is easier to file for a sole proprietorship than an LLC. In an LLC, you are more separated from the business, meaning you are not personally responsible for the debt if the company goes under. In other words, you don't have to give up your house to pay the debts of the company, unless you do something illegal.You'll file for these structures through your home state.Most states charge a fee for filing, though it's usually not too much. A third option is a partnership, which generally acts as sole proprietorship spread among partners., This number identifies your business to the IRS. If you chose sole proprietorship, you don't absolutely need an EIN. However, it gives you a number to use for tax purposes that is not your Social Security Number, so it can be helpful.The easiest way to apply for an EIN is online on the IRS website. The form only takes a few minutes to fill out, and you get your number quickly. The process is free., Generally, if you own a small business without customers who visit your place of business, you can run it out of your home. However, you should always check with your city first to see what laws they have around home businesses. For instance, the city may not allow your business to run out of your garage.Of course, you can also choose to start your business out of a storefront. In that case, you'll need to scout a location. In addition, buying or renting a space is a significant investment., Your city may require you to have certain permits to run your business. The easiest way to find out is simply to ask at your city clerk office, which should be able to tell you what you need., You can set up a business account with any bank, though it may make it easier to do it through a bank you already frequent. A business account helps you keep personal purchases separate from business purchases., That is, make sure you are tracking what you spend and what you make. You don't necessarily need expensive software to keep track of it. You can do it in a spreadsheet, if you want., As a small business owner, you must pay your federal taxes in quarterly if you expect to pay in more than $1,000. It's similar to how your employer would withhold taxes for you, except now you must do it yourself.You make payments through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System., You'll also need to pay state taxes, as well as the federal taxes. Generally, you pay company income taxes once a year, but you may need to pay in sales taxes more often, such as quarterly. Check with your state to see what it requires. You may even need to get a state identification number.In some states, you'll need a certificate of resale to collect sales taxes on products.Also, it may be easiest to hire an accountant to take care of both your state and federal taxes for you, as accountants will be better versed in what you will owe., You can design one yourself or hire a pro. A pro will have the experience to create a great logo you can use across many platforms. A logo is what represents your business to your customers, so it needs to be simple, interesting, and recognizable. Once you have a logo, you can use it to design labels for your candles and to create business cards., Most cities, even small ones, have local craft shows where you can sell your wares. Consider a wide variety of options. For instance, even food and wine fairs often have crafting vendors. Of course, you'll also need to pay for booth space to participate., You have a couple of options when you offer crafts in local stores. Some stores will buy your product outright and resell it. Others will only take a commission when your product sells.A third option is buying booth space in a craft store that sells local crafts.   The easiest stores to get into are ones that offer booth space, as you pay for the space. However, it's not always easy to make your booth space back. When approaching stores with your wares, have pictures with you, as well as samples. Be professional by being polite and dressing up. In addition, always call first to see when an appropriate time to come in would be. Some stores prefer that you provide photos online., Craft websites are becoming more and more popular. Generally, you set up your own mini site through the larger site, creating a virtual store front. The website handles the transactions for you, and then you mail the product where it needs to go.The best parts of using a craft website is you don't have to maintain a website, and you've got traffic built in. However, you don't have as much control over design or policies.You can also build your own website, but that takes some technical know-how, especially if you want to add in a way to buy on the site.  One of the best ways to market your product is through social media. Basically, you set up business accounts on major social media websites. You can then friend people or use hashtags to attract customers.It's important to engage with your customers and other people in the industry. If you just throw products at them, you're likely to turn customers off. However, if you build relationships, you'll be more likely to gain customers. That means offering value outside of your products (such as tutorials or funny content), talking with customers, and engaging with other people who are in the community.If you want people to promote your content, you should be promoting others, as well. When someone shares your picture, try sharing something in return.Share quality content. Quality content will get other people to share it as well. That means taking good pictures and being professional in everything you do., One way to help people find your product is to use keywords and hashtags to your advantage. When you're selling on a crafting website, you need to find the right keywords to help your product stand out. That means picking keywords that are unique to your product but that are also trendy. Think about what you would use to search for your product.The same can be said of hashtags. On certain social media sites, hashtags are used to group pictures and content. By using the right hashtags, you'll find customers who will connect to your product. For instance, if you make 100 percent pure beeswax candles, you can use the hashtag #purebeeswaxcandles to help others find you.	Decide what type of candle you would like to make. Pick a wax to work with. Learn the technique. Practice the technique. Get a lawyer. Pick a name. Choose the appropriate business structure. Apply for an employer identification number (EIN). Decide on the location of your business. Ask about permits. Set up a business account. Keep track of your money. Pay federal taxes quarterly. Register for state taxes. Get a logo. Vend at craft fairs. Sell in local stores. Sell online. Market your product. Use keywords and hashtags to your advantage.
First, purchase plate hanging hardware from your local craft store. Then, plan how you want to hang the plates. You could arrange them by alternating sizes, shapes, or colors. Choose from a circular or rectangular arrangement., Remove the original paint if you don't like the color or if you think it might contain lead. For a vintage look, use your index finger to apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly anywhere you don't want the paint to stick. Then, paint the entire surface and let the paint dry for a few hours. After that, run a damp rag over the areas you applied the petroleum jelly. The paint will come right off., Hang a salvaged window of any shape or size from the wall to display as art. Place it on a wall that receives direct sunlight for an interesting play of light. To create a sense of variety, complement curved lines with straight ones. For example, hang a circular window above a chair with a rectangular back.You can also use each quadrant of a divided window as a picture frame. Hang vintage lithographs, such as floral prints. Tack them to the wall with mounting putty or place them in small frames and hang them as you normally would. You can find mounting putty online or in your local craft store., If you bought an interesting antique frame but haven't found a painting or print to fill it, try displaying the frame by itself. You can choose to paint it a new color or keep the original paint job/finish. Consider making it the centerpiece of an arrangement among paintings or prints., With a little imagination, the possibilities with old shutters are endless. Prop three or four behind the couch or chairs to create a sense of texture on an otherwise smooth wall. Fasten them to the walls if you choose not to place furniture in front of them.On the other hand, you can hang one or two shutters horizontally over the kitchen table to organize mail or display postcards., If your kitchen is largely white, hang vintage copper pots and pans to create a rustic feel.On the other hand, if you prefer a more modern approach, hang vintage enamelware. You could also paint metal cookware with bolder colors. Go with colors that are in the same family as your wall color or aim for a more dynamic look by choosing contrasting colors.	Hang antique plates as wall décor. Create a “distressed” paint job for wooden antiques. Upcycle a vintage window. Hang empty frames as art. Use old shutters as an interior backdrop. Decorate your kitchen with old cookware.
Most vehicles need to be turned on for the audio system to play. Unless your car is particular, you won't need to fully start the engine, which would only waste gas.; , Pick something that you play often in your car, so you know what to listen for. This will help you spot anything that sounds unusual. You could also pick a song that has a clear and familiar bass line.  If the audio is too low, it will be hard to tell if you have a blown speaker. This doesn't mean that you should blast your whole neighborhood with your tunes to diagnose your vehicle.   Adjust the treble and bass, if necessary. Make sure that their levels are equal in the twelve o'clock position. When you hear a lack of range, it might just mean your system isn't equalized properly., If you have trouble recognizing distortion, play a track on headphones or on another device. Then, play that same track through your car's sound system. If you hear crackles or the song sounds slightly muffled, one or more of your speakers might be blown.   Listen for rattling. If the speaker is blown, you will likely hear a shaking, rattling sound., If a certain bass, mid, or high speaker is blown, you will notice certain registers don't come through. This is easiest if you are familiar with the song, and know what to listen for or expect., If possible, use your audio system's fader controls to attempt to isolate the faulty speaker. By narrowing down one section of the car, you'll have a better chance of determining which speaker is blown. Always try to isolate the problem so you don't overspend and replace the entire system.Use the pan function to switch the sound from left to right. When panning, go 100% to either the left or right side to fully isolate it. Use the fade settings the same as the pan setting. Go 100% to the rear or front of your car.  Listen out for a brief popping sound form the speaker.This might require you to unscrew the speaker out of its holder. Only remove the wires if you're comfortable handling electronics.  Remove the speaker cover so you can inspect the speaker itself. Attach the wires to a 9-volt battery again and observe the speaker. If the cone moves, your problem is in the connection, not the speaker., These simple electronic tools help measure ohms and voltages. They can be found at your local electronic store or hardware store.   You can also use an ohmmeter.  Set your device to reading ohms if you're using a multimeter. Make sure that the speakers are turned off. Touch the lead of your device to each terminal of the speaker. The terminal is the part of the speaker where the wires attach.If you get a reading of 1.0 ohms, then that speaker is not blown and the problem is somewhere else. If the device reads infinite ohms, then your speaker is blown., If there is something wrong with the amplifier, you will likely hear some sound distortion when you turn on your speakers, or nothing at all. This is usually because there is something wrong with the fuse or the capacitor.  If you don't know where the fuse box is, you can check online or in the manual that came with your car, as each car will be a little different. A fuse box will usually be located in the front of the knee-well or under the dashboard, however., This will help you figure out whether or not the fuse is good or needs  , Touch the multimeter's red wire to one of the poles on the fuse. Touch the meter's black wire to the other pole.  If you hear a beep, then the fuse is good, and your problem is likely with the capacitor. If you don't hear a beep, then the fuse is blown and needs to be replaced. Be sure to get the exact same fuse model.   If you hear a beep, consider replacing the amp first. They are usually less expensive, and don't require soldering irons and desoldering pumps like new capacitors do.  They should be working now. If they don't, then there might be something else wrong with your car's speakers. Consider taking your car in to the repair shop, and having a professional take a look at it.  Visually take a look at the speaker once you've determined the speaker is faulty. Look for holes, tears, or splits on the speaker. Make sure the cover of the speaker is off so you can truly inspect it. Most damage that you'll be able to see will be on the cone of the speaker, or the soft part.   Gently run your hand along the cone to make sure there isn't any scrapes you can't see. Dust or dirt shouldn't effect the quality of the speaker, but it might be a good idea to clean them out.  If you only have a small tear, you can fix the damages with a sealer designed for speakers. If the damage is overwhelming, you'll probably need to replace the speaker.  Once you've determined one of your speakers is blown, you'll want to see if any of the other speakers are blown. Remove the faulty speaker, if you haven't already done so. Play a track in your car and listen for speaker irregularities.   If the problem persists in multiple speakers, consider replacing the entire system. Follow the above steps to test any other suspicious speakers.  Take your car or speaker to an automotive audio specialist. Explain the tests you gave and ask them what their estimate would be to inspect and repair the speaker or speakers. Be frank and ask if she thinks it'll be more price effective to replace the set.	Turn on the vehicle. Insert a CD or mp3 device with a full sound range. Turn the volume to an appropriate level. Recognize distortion. Listen for a lack of range. Isolate the speaker. Remove the wires from the amplifier and attach them to a 9-volt battery. Inspect the speaker. Get a multimeter tester. Test the ohms. Understand how bad amplifiers can affect sound. Open the fuse box. Get out your multimeter and set it to the conductivity test. Hook up the multimeter to the fuse box. Listen for any beeps. Turn on the car, and test the speakers. Inspect the damage. Repair minor damages. Test the remaining speakers. Let the professionals look.
This is something that car insurance companies, as well as prime auto businesses like Edmund's and Consumer Reports, all suggest for new car owners. Get all the items and equipment you would need to deal with a roadside emergency and make such situations less dangerous and inconvenient.   Get maintenance-related emergency kit items like jumper cables and extra oil and coolant. Purchase other types of emergency kit items to help you with specific roadside incidents. Many of the pros recommend a set of flares for visibility on the road, as well as a flashlight to be able to inspect vehicles and other items in the dark, and a blanket to help you stay warm if your auto's heating system fails in an extremely cold environment.; , Many experts recommend purchasing a comprehensive set of tools for dealing with car-related situations.   Find the right wrench set. Each specific vehicle has its own sizes of bolts and other hardware. You'll need to figure out what sizes you would use for items like battery posts and terminals, and get the right wrenches to match. You'll also want to make sure that there is a proper wrench for lug nuts, for changing or rotating tires. In addition to the tire wrench or iron, make sure you have an appropriate jack for raising the vehicle for routine maintenance or other incidents.  One popular tool is a windshield scraper for maintaining visibility when ice accumulates on the windshield or windows of the vehicle.  Besides the tools and equipment mentioned above, there are a few different types of simple screens and visors that some car owners like to purchase, including back window screens, extra fold downs on mirrors or other sunshade equipment.  Some basic accessories can also help with vehicle maintenance or convenience for drivers and passengers.   Look at storage capacity for your vehicle. From CD books for vehicles with a disc player, to extra cup holders or bungee cords for holding large items safely, you may want to invest in storage-related accessories for your vehicle. Such items can help protect and maintain the interior of your car. Consider buying a car cover. If you don't have a garage and want to protect the paint job on your vehicle, a car cover can do the trick. Buy one of these heavy-duty covers and install it on your vehicle when you're not using it to prolong the life of your investment.	Purchase an emergency kit or related items. Get the right tools. Find other maintenance items. Locate other visibility items as necessary. Evaluate your need for accessories.
Trying to paint ceiling corners with a bunch of furniture in the way will only make a hard job even harder. Plus, you risk dripping paint on your furniture by accident. Pull furniture away from the walls and move it to the center of the room before you get started. If you’re painting the whole ceiling and not just the ceiling corners, remove your furniture to another room entirely., Lay blue painter’s tape along the entire perimeter of the wall where it meets the ceiling. This will prevent the paint you’re applying to the ceiling from accidentally getting on the wall., Lay down a drop cloth before you start working. If you don’t have a dropcloth, use an old set of sheets.If you’re only painting ceiling corners, you can probably get away with just laying down some thick cardboard or a layer of newspapers beneath the corner in question.  Painting ceiling corners can be messy. Wear heavy overalls or old clothes when painting. Do not wear new clothes or anything that you might be concerned about if it got paint on it.Disposable rubber gloves might also be useful. Wear a hat, too, to protect your head.  To start the process, dip a five or six-centimeter-wide (three-inch-wide) paintbrush into your paint of choice. Move the brush along the ceiling in one continuous direction, painting a six-centimeter (three-inch) margin of the ceiling.Use a ladder to reach the ceiling. Place your bucket of paint on top of it. If the ceiling corners you wish to paint are too tall to reach with a ladder, erect scaffolding. Paint the edge of the ceiling as thickly as possible without the paint dripping., When you reach the corner of the wall, begin painting another continuous margin along the adjoining wall, heading away from the corner. Use your paintbrush to paint this strip, too. This second margin along the ceiling should be just as wide as the first strip you painted., After painting a strip of paint across the entire perimeter of the ceiling, dip your loaded roller into the paint of your choice. Roll it towards the ceiling corner you’re interested in painting in such a way that it overlaps a bit with the area you just painted with the paintbrush. Roll in one direction toward the opposite side of the room.Do not place the roller directly overhead or you risk dripping paint on yourself. Use a roller with a nap of more than ½ inch (one centimeter)., You’ll be able to tell that you need more paint on your loaded roller when you notice that it is no longer applying paint to the ceiling. When this happens, dip – but do not submerge – your roller in paint., After your first corner has been painted, paint the ceiling in strips that touch each other, and that run parallel to the direction in which you painted the first corner. For instance, if you painted the ceiling corner by pushing the loaded roller from the front to the back of your room, continue applying paint by moving the loaded roller along a front-to-back axis.In this way, you’ll paint two corners, then the rest of the ceiling, then the final two corners.  As you paint the ceiling, step back and examine your progress. Look for areas where the paint has been applied unevenly (that is, areas where the paint is too light). Roll the loaded roller across these areas when you detect them., If you decide to apply a second coat, use the same method you did the first time – use the loaded roller to apply the paint in parallel strips – but move in a direction perpendicular to the strips you applied the first time.	Remove any furniture that you can from the room. Tape the edges of the wall. Protect your floor. Wear old clothes or overalls. Use a paintbrush to paint towards the corner. Paint away from the corner. Paint toward the corner with a loaded roller. Reload your roller with paint as needed. Move in parallel strips to cover the ceiling. Evaluate your work regularly. Let the paint dry before deciding if it needs another coat.
In order to dance to music, you need to be able to identify the beat. Listen to a song and try and tap your foot or clap your hands along to the beat. Depending on the song, the beat may be slow or fast. When you are first learning to identify the beat, listen to music that has a strong drum beat. This will make it easier for you to hear the rhythm.For example, try dancing to Beyonce's "Crazy in Love" or The Bee Gee's "Night Fever.", Once you have identified the beat of the music, you can try moving your body to the beat. When you are first learning to dance, it is best to isolate different movements. Begin by keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground and move your arms to the beat of the song. You can move your arms from side to side or up and down.Your arms are also connected to your shoulders and torso, so try moving them as well. Experiment with non-linear arm movements by creating waves.  Now that your arms are moving to the music, try adding in your feet. You can start out simple, by picking up one foot and then the other, kind of like marching on the spot. As you get more comfortable you can try bending your knees and bouncing in time with the music. Continue to bounce and then add in steps to the side.Try to incorporate your hips and other parts of your lower body into your dance movement.  Search online for dance studios in your area and research the different beginner classes available. Choose a dance style that you are interested in learning. For example, you could try hip hop, jazz, contemporary, ballroom, etc.Alternatively, if you are looking for something more casual, you could find a dance class at a local community centre or YMCA. You can also watch instructional dance videos online or purchase one on DVD.	Identify the beat of a song. Try moving your arms. Learn some basic footwork. Take dance lessons.

Holding the containers, carefully mix approximately 1 teaspoon of dye powder in a small amount of lukewarm water. (If you are using a Dylon tin, sellotape the remainder closed and put into a plastic bag.) Mix to a paste and then add up to 100ml of water. Wear a mask for this stage. The fabric in the sink is to catch any dye spillages. It can be added to the dye baths later. If your containers have tops, screw them on and put to one side., Stir until it is dissolved. Make up to 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of solution by adding extra water.	Line a sink with damp fabric. Mix 200g of washing soda in a jug of boiling water.
Baking soda is a great cleaning agent. To get rid of the dye, mix baking soda with distilled vinegar or lemon juice. Make a paste that is the consistency of toothpaste. Spread it over the stain. Use a sponge to gently rub it into the wood. When you're finished, wipe the paste from area. When you're finished, rinse with a rag and plain water.You can use your fingers instead of a sponge. Add some more vinegar or water if the stain is being stubborn. Repeat the process until the stain is removed. You can also try a magic eraser to remove dye.  For food and nail polish stains, try using dish detergent. Mix the soap in warm water, soak a rag in the solution, and then rub over the spot.   This method works best with non-greasy stains.  For greasy stains on wood, try using a little bit of ammonia mixed with cold water. Cover a rag with the solution, and then gently rub over the stain., When pets mess on wood floors, bacteria must be removed. Bacteria causes stains and odor. To remove stains and bacteria, use a 5 percent phenol solution, which can be bought at hardware and home improvement stores. Clean the area by using a damp, soft cloth.   If your floor has a wax finish, use fine steel wool and mineral spirits to clean the area. Clean the area in a circular motion. Wax and buff the area afterwards., Place a small amount of isopropyl alcohol onto a rag. Gently rub the stain to remove it. Wipe off with a damp rag afterwards to rinse.   Test on the underside of your table first to make sure it doesn't damage the table. Try toothpaste on the permanent marker stain, too., Use Oxalic Acid, which is found in wood bleach and some household cleaners. You can buy it at home improvement stores and some grocery stores. First, you need to strip the area with the stain of the finish so you can treat it.Mix the Oxalic Acid mixture with water to make a thick paste. Make sure not to do this in a metal bowl since Oxalic Acid can cause discoloration in metal. Apply to the stain with a rag or disposable paint brush. Let it sit until it dries. Add multiple applications.Rinse the area between the applications.If the bleach doesn't remove it, the stain may be from something else, like food or wine. Try hydrogen peroxide or household bleach then. Refinish the spot. Don't refinish the whole piece unless you have to. Black stains are water stains that have penetrated deeper into the wood. They are much harder to get rid of.	Use baking soda on dye stains. Use dish detergent for non-greasy stains. Rub greasy stains with ammonia. Clean pet stains with a bacteria killing solution. Use isopropyl alcohol for permanent marker stains. Use bleach to get rid of black stains.
You should see numerous lights turn on in the dash.; , In some cases, such as a low fuel warning light, you may need to press the 'BC' button on the end of the indicator stalk once to remove them.  An exclamation mark will appear in the screen in middle of the speedometer, but keep holding down the button until the next picture appears- then let go.  When you arrive at the service that you wish to reset press and hold the black button until the text 'Reset?' is visible under the picture, then let go. Finally press and hold the button again to confirm the reset.  This is done similarly by pressing singularly to scroll though the numbers and a long press to confirm your selection. Also I have had instances where statutory inspections will not reset. In Australia neither of these services are required and they can be removed at any BMW dealership, if you can't reset them manually you'll have to visit the dealer.

If you're just starting out for school band, it's common to rent a clarinet from the school, or from a music shop in your town. It's much easier to learn on a properly maintained instrument that's new, instead of one that's been sitting in the attic gathering mildew. It's also a lot cheaper than buying a new model.   If you're a beginner, a plastic clarinet is recommended. A Buffet B12 or Yamaha 255 are both popular models, but stick to a plastic first instrument as wood clarinets can be more difficult to play and maintain. It's usually common to use a soft reed; 2 to 2 and a half will most often work. If you have an old clarinet you want to use, take it into a music shop to get it fixed up. The pads will likely need to be changed, to make sure you get a clear tone from the horn.; , Most clarinets come in carrying cases, with fitted slots for each component of the instrument. When it's time to take it out and put it together, inspect the case to make sure you've got all the parts ready to go in good working order.The pieces are assembled from bottom to top, in the following order:   The bell is the bottom component of the horn, and it fans out like a megaphone. The bottom stack makes up the main body of the clarinet, and it will have a cork connection piece on only one end of the section. The top stack makes up the other major section of the main body of the clarinet, and will have cork on both ends of the section. Line up the straight metal hinge on both pieces to orient the barrel properly. The barrel should be a short piece, 3-4 inches long, and slightly more flared at one end than the other. The mouthpiece is the top-most section of the instrument, and should come with a metal or leather ligature, which is used to hold the reed in place. Line up the bottom of the mouthpiece with the long straight octave key on the instrument.  Slide the reed between the ligature and mouthpiece, with the flat part facing in. Tighten the nobs on the ligature until it's tight enough to stay on. When taking the clarinet part be careful not to let the screws fall out; they are extremely hard to get back in. Over-tightening can strain the mouthpiece, so be gentle.   Don't put the reed higher than the mouthpiece, which makes it extremely difficult to produce a note. The tip of the reed should fall even with the tip of the mouthpiece.  The clarinet should be held away from yourself, at a 45 degree angle, the bell just past your knees. Keep your head up and your back straight when playing. The clarinet should come to your mouth, your mouth shouldn't go to the clarinet.   The clarinet should be held with your right hand on the bottom stack, your thumb on the thumb-rest on the back of the stack. Your other three fingers should rest on the three corresponding keyholes. Your left hand should hold the instrument on the top stack. Your thumb should rest on the octave key on the back of the instrument. Your other three fingers will rest on the three main keys on the bottom of the top stack. When your fingers are not in use, keep them very close to the holes to make it easier for them to get to the keys when they are needed. If you keep your fingers too far away from the clarinet, it will make it difficult to play fast things.  If you try to play on a dry reed, it will sound bad and will probably squeak more often. Before a performance or practice session, place your reed in a small jar or wet with saliva.   Try to start with a softer reed, between sizes 1 and 2.5. As your mouth muscles get stronger, you will start needing harder reeds. You will know when to bump up reeds when your clarinet starts sounding like a person talking with their nose plugged. Your teacher will also tell you if you need a softer or harder reed.  Every time you play your clarinet, you need to take it apart and clean it to keep moisture from accumulating inside the horn. You can clean the instrument fairly quickly and easily.   Most horns should come with a cleaning rag, which you can draw through the body of the horn after each use. One end should have a string attached, which you use to pull through each section of the horn. It only takes a minute, but helps to keep your horn in good working order. Every now and then, it's also good to use a Q-TIp to clean around the connection points, where little particles and saliva can accumulate.Grease your corks regularly. It can make it hard to put together and take apart your clarinet if you let the corks dry up. Once you play your clarinet a lot you can grease the corks about once a week. If you grease the corks too much they may slide off.  Say "whee" and while holding this shape, say "too". Hold this shape (known as your embouchure) and put the clarinet in your mouth.   Keep your jaw flat. Your top teeth should be planted firmly on the top of your mouthpiece, opposite of the reed side. If you just push the horn into your mouth and blow, it'll be hard to make a note. It takes a little work in making the right shape with your mouth, called the embouchure.  If your lips aren't sealing it enough, air will escape and no sound will come out. Try to lift the corners of your mouth to tighten it even more. Your tongue should be pointing at the reed when you play, but not touching it.   This may be hard to get used to at first and you will probably learn it best by taking lessons.  With your mouth properly position, just try to blow to make a tone. Experiment with different strengths of breath, and get a sense of how much it takes to get a good-sounding tone from the horn. It'll take some work. With no keys pressed, you'll play an open G on the clarinet.   If you squeaked, don't be discouraged. It's hard to get used to the clarinet mouth shape. Just keep trying, and experimenting with different amounts of air to put through the horn.  It can be tempting to puff out your cheeks when you play, but you'll get a more even and consistent tone if you avoid this. Practice playing in the mirror to avoid puffing them out.At first, this may make you squeak much more. If you squeak a lot, check where your mouth is on the mouthpiece. Make sure it is not too high or low on your mouthpiece. Your teacher can help you with this. Also make sure your reed is lined up correctly.  Push down some keys to experiment with different notes, seeing how it changes the strength that you need to use to blow through the horn. try to get a sense of what makes the sound go higher and lower. Just play around for a while.   When you are playing, always cover the holes completely. If you don't, the notes won't come out. Especially when you are using the register key, be sure that all holes are covered completely., Check out your local music store again and see what kinds of beginner clarinet books they have. Some commonly used ones are Band Expressions, Standard of Excellence, and Rubank Elementary Method. All of them will teach you how to play songs and learn the proper fingerings for each note.It'll be hard to go very far on clarinet without learning to read sheet music. The clarinet is a treble-clef instrument in the Bb range, so you'll need to learn the basics of the treble clef to learn more about playing the instrument. The best way to do this is usually school band or private lessons.  If you practice scales and arpeggios, your technique for solos and other repertoire will be much smoother. Finger patterns are essential for playing clarinet well, and you can learn those quickly by practicing these runs.   These will probably be taught to you eventually by your teacher eventually, if you have one.  As with any instrument, if you're just playing for fun, start off with things you know. there are plenty of (not too challenging) popular pieces for the clarinet, especially if you like swing and jazz, which is more intuitive. The classical repertoire can be more demanding, but there are easier pieces here if you look hard enough.  It's very hard to learn to play clarinet just from reading a book. It's best to start out with a teacher instead of on your own so that you won't miss anything or learn anything wrong. Often, school music teachers will offer lessons for cheap.   Bad habits can develop without you even knowing, which can make it hard to get past a certain skill level. If you want to play clarinet the right way, take lessons.  If you are truly interested in playing the clarinet, find a teacher and join a band or orchestra.   Prepare for the long haul! You aren't going to become a good player overnight. Start with the basics then move on to more advanced things. Playing an instrument is a life-long learning project.	Get a clarinet appropriate for your purposes. Inspect the clarinet and learn the names of the parts. Assemble the mouthpiece and reed properly. Hold the clarinet properly. Wet the reed before you play. Disassemble and clean the clarinet after each use. Put the horn in your mouth properly. Seal the corners of your mouth around the mouthpiece. Try to get an even tone. Keep your cheeks tight. Try to play a few notes. Get a fingering chart. Practice scales and arpeggios. Learn songs. Consider taking private lessons. Join your school band or orchestra.
Look for a product that contains a mixture of enzymes that liquify waste materials. These enzymes are used in septic systems to break down waste.Products of this sort can be usually be purchased at home improvement stores in or near the plumbing aisle. Enzyme waste removal is preferable to using a drain-clearing chemical because it will not harm your pipes or the environment.This method will only work on organic waste, not toys or other objects.  Pour the recommended amount of the enzyme product into the toilet bowl. You will typically be instructed to wait overnight for the enzymes to go to work on the clog. The toilet should drain once the clog has cleared.	Purchase an enzyme waste removal product. Follow the instructions on the container.
If you pay off some of your loan balance, your total interest costs will decline. You may be able to get a smaller monthly payment, even if interest rates are the same. When you pay down your principal, you can contact your lender about restructuring the loan.Assume that you have a $10,000 car loan and an 8% interest rate. Your loan has 4 years remaining. You decide to pay down $2,000 of the $10,000 balance. You ask your lender if the monthly payments can be reduced, since your new loan balance is only $8,000. Even if your interest rate remains at 8%, your monthly loan payments may be lower.  You may be able to refinance a group of loans with new loan terms. Your monthly payment on one larger loan may be lower after consolidating several smaller loans.Meet with a lender to talk through the pros and cons of a consolidation loan. A consolidation can help you lower the interest rate on your debts. However, you need to consider the risks of a variable rate loan, or extending the term of a loan.Say that you have a $10,000 car loan at 8%. You also have three credit card balances totaling $6,000. The average interest rate on your three cards is 12%. Two factors may lower your interest rate on these loans. If interest rates have declined, or if your credit rating has improved, you may be able to lower the interest rate for these consolidated debts. Having one consolidated payment to make each month also simplifies things for you. When you create your monthly budget, you don’t need to account for so many payments.  A good way to reduce your payments is to make payments on a cheaper car. This is another way to reduce your payment, even if interest rates have not declined.The car you sell must be worth more than the loan balance. If not, you may need to pay for the difference out of your own pocket. Assume that your loan is for $9,500, and your car is worth $10,000. When you sell your car, you can use the $500 profit as a down payment on a $6,500 car. The $6,000 loan balance reduces your required monthly car payment.	Pay down some of your loan’s principal. Consolidate your car loan with other debts. Sell your car and buy a less expensive vehicle.
It does better when it isn't fussed over. The best fertilizers to use are ‘Aquarium food drops’, ‘Green Green (commercial food, check online-it's great for all your plants)’, or ‘Miracle Grow’ (very diluted-if it says 20 drops per gallon, use just 2 drops).	Lucky bamboo can be fertilized every 2 months or longer.
; , Be sure to contain the alcohol to only the stained portion of the couch. ,   This method also works to remove water rings, lipstick or other oil-based stains. Water that has soaked into microfiber fabric often causes a darkening of that area. Work the rubbing alcohol gently into that area.	Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a white towel. Rub the stain gently with the towel. Wipe it clean of any excess alcohol.  , Repeat 2 to 3 times until the stain is removed.
When you’re new to layering, it helps to choose jewelry that all has a similar style. You might opt for all antique or vintage pieces, or go for an edgier look with studded or spiked items. Select pieces that all have a similar aesthetic so they look like they belong together.The easiest style to start with when you’re layering jewelry is minimal pieces. Choose necklaces with small, delicate pendants, fine chain bracelets, or rings with thin bands. If you really want to make a bold statement with your layered jewelry, you can pair contrasting styles. For example, you might layer an antique ring with a studded modern style. Keep in mind, though, that it's a more dramatic, risky look so it's best for an evening out rather than a casual, everyday occasion.; , If you’re new to layering jewelry, you’ll have an easier time if you select pieces that all share a common element or theme in addition to a similar style. Choose pieces that are all made of the same metal or material, or go with pieces that all feature the same type of gemstone. Pieces that all have the same shape charms can also work.The easiest way to find a common theme is to stick to jewelry that’s all the same metal or material. For example, choose all gold necklaces or all silver rings. If you want to mix metals or materials, select items that all feature the same gemstones. For example, you might choose gold and silver necklaces that all have pearl details. Utilizing a similar shape can also help when you’re mixing metals. For example, you might mix gold and rose gold rings that all feature heart-shaped designs.  While you want to choose jewelry that has a similar style and some type of common theme for layering, you don’t necessarily want all of the pieces to look the same. To add some variety to your look, use items that have different weights, such as pairing skinny rope chains with chunkier beads.For example, you might pair a thin gold chain with a small pearl pendant with a strand of large chunky pearls.  When layering jewelry, you want to focus the attention in one area or you may wind up with an overdone look. If you’re wearing several necklaces, opt for a single bracelet and simple ring. If you’re wearing a stack of bracelets, choose a delicate chain necklace. That will give you a more balanced look.If you’re headed out for the evening or a special occasion, you may want to make a bolder statement and layer your jewelry in more than one area, such as wearing multiple necklaces and stacked bracelets. It’s still best to keep the rest of your accessories minimal, though.  The key to layering necklaces is choosing pieces that vary in length so you can stagger them. It’s usually best to start with a choker or 16-inch (41-cm) necklace that will fall high on your neckline and go down a couple of inches (5-cm) with each additional necklace.Not only does varying the length of your necklaces allow each to stand out, it helps prevent them from becoming tangled while you’re wearing them.  If you are wearing necklaces that are similar in length, make them stand out from one another by playing with the placement of their pendants or central charms. For example, you might leave one in the center, slide another to rest a few inches (7.5-cm) to the right or left of center, and move another to sit on one side of your collarbone.Your necklaces may get slightly tangled if you wear them in this way. Don’t worry about it -- it can actually add to the look.  You can create a bold look by layering several heavy, chunky statement necklaces that rest almost on top of one another. It will give you collar-like effect that helps draw attention to your face.For example, you might layer a chunky gold chain necklace, a colorful enamel necklace, and boldly shaped gold statement necklace that are all about 16- to 18-inches (41- to 46-cm) long. To keep the look from appearing too heavy, don’t use more than two or three statement necklaces to create the collar effect. This is an ideal way to layer necklaces over a collared shirt, but you can also do it with a high neck, boatneck, or scoop neck top.  If you’re new to layering bracelets, it’s best to keep things simple. Instead of wearing multiple bracelets on both wrists, limit your layering to one wrist. You can wear as many bracelets as you’d like on that wrist if you leave your other one bare.If you don’t want to leave your other wrist completely bare, stick to one simple, delicate bracelet. That will keep you from looking overloaded.  To make sure that your layered bracelets stand out and add to your outfit, it helps to vary the thicknesses and shapes of your bracelets. Layer some thin chain bracelets with a chunky bangle, or pair a couple of round bracelets with a square style.If you prefer wear bracelets that are similar in width and shape, you can add visual interest to the look by mixing materials, such as metal and beads, for added texture.  When you’re layering bracelets, there’s no reason why you can’t incorporate your favorite watch. As with any type of jewelry, though, make sure that your watch shares some common element with the bracelets.For example, if you’re wearing gold and silver bracelets, choose a watch that’s gold, silver, or features elements of both. If your watch doesn’t have a metal band, try to match the color of the leather or other material to the bracelet’s details.  While layering your rings means that you can wear multiple pieces on a single finger, you can maximize the impact by spreading them out across more than one finger. For example, you might wear a single ring on your index finger, three or four on your middle finger, and two on your ring finger. You can also wear rings on both hands to really make a statement.To highlight a specific stack of rings, you may want to leave the finger next to it bare. When you’re deciding how to spread out your rings, consider wearing a pinky and/or thumb ring to add even more personality to your look.  Your layered rings will look less styled if you adjust the placement. Instead of wearing all of them at the base of your finger, vary them. Place some rings closer to the end of your finger, some in the middle, and some at the base so your look has a more eclectic feel.You don’t want your rings to fall off or feel uncomfortable, so be sure that they fit the area of the finger where you plan to wear them.  Just as with bracelets, your look will have more personality if you vary the size and shape of your rings. By combining thin and chunky styles and simple round bands with designs that run vertical or horizontal, your layered rings will draw more attention.For example, you might wear a couple of thin, delicate bands on your index finger, a single oversized cocktail ring on your middle finger, and three or four styles with small stones in the center on your ring finger.	Aim for the same style. Choose a common element. Mix weights. Keep your look balanced. Wear necklaces in different lengths. Adjust your pendants. Use chunky necklaces to create a collar effect. Focus on one wrist. Vary the thicknesses and shapes. Work in a watch. Spread the rings out across your fingers. Place the rings on different sections of the finger. Use different sizes and shapes.
It does not necessarily have to be in your local area, as many charter companies will have professional affiliates in your area.; , Quotes for most trips are hard to give on-line due to the many variables involved.

Make sure the bottles have the five bumpy ridges on the bottom--the ridges are an essential part of your project. For best results, empty the bottle and then clean soda with hot soapy water. Allow enough time to dry so you aren’t working with a wet bottle.   Provide one bottle per artist or per color if you plan to use multiple colors.; , You will be dipping the bottom of the soda bottle in paint and then transferring it to the paper. This means the bottom of the bottle will be coated in paint and will dry with a bit of a three-dimensional design (which requires a heavier paper to hold the additional paint).  Tempera paint works well with this project because of its consistency and the non-toxic aspect. Choose several colors to design multi-colored cherry blossoms or stick with the traditional pale pink.   Pick up a bottle of black and/or brown paint and a paint brush to create the cherry blossom tree branches and trunk.  You will spread the newspaper on a table to create a workspace for your artist. A simple paper plate can hold your paint, but make sure you have enough plates per artist and color.   Consider finding old shirts to use as smocks in order to protect clothing, especially if you are doing this craft with children.	Empty a few 2-liter soda bottles. Purchase heavy artist paper. Choose paint. Find old newspaper, a paper plate per color and an area for painting.
Choose a small- to medium-sized plastic planting pot with drainage holes.; , Saguaro, like other cacti, need extremely loose, loamy and coarse soil that is free of organic fertilizers like manure.   Combine 1-part each of sand, peat moss, turf soil and garden loam. Fill the pot 3/4 full of soil.  Poke several small holes in the soil 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart using a pencil. Make the holes about 1/8 inch (0.4 cm) deep. Place the saguaro seeds in the holes and lightly pinch the soil closed over them.  Place plastic wrap securely over the pot. Poke holes in the plastic wrap to aerate the soil. , Sprinkle water over the soil every 10 days so the seeds don't dry out. Even when growing from seed, cacti do not like too much water, so do not water more than every 10 days.  After 4 to 6 weeks, you will be able to remove the plastic wrap. Keep the saguaro seedlings moist by watering once a month.	Select a container for your saguaro cactus seeds. Mix soil and fill the pot. Place holes in the soil for the seeds. Cover the seeds. Place the pot at room temperature or warmer in a location that is well lit, but not in direct sunlight.  , Keep the seeds moist. Remove the plastic wrap.
This means removing grease, mud, organic matter, fuel, etc. Use clean rags to clean it up each time, and a compressed air blower can help to clean out the ventilation fans. , A generator should not be subjected to moisture or water. Keep it in a dry space and covered against dust, mud, grime, etc.	Always clean the generator post-use. If there are any signs of corrosion present, treat with an inhibitor product.  , Store the generator properly.
Whitewashing is best suited to a soft wood like pine.A wood like oak will require pickling, a technique of whitening wood. Pickling is considered a method, not a finish, and though you can pickle pine and other soft woods, woods like oak and ash are the most common type of wood you can pickle. You can create your own pickling stain for oak and ash wood, or you can purchase pre made pickling stains.; , Taking off the doors will make them easier to whitewash and give you easier access to the cabinet frames. It's also a good idea to work on the cabinetry and the doors separately.   Use a drill to remove the doors. When you store the screws, label them so you can tell which door they came from. As the hardware is already set to a particular door, labelling the screws will prevent any confusion later when putting the doors back on., Before you start treating the wood, use rags and a heavy duty degreaser to clean the doors. Apply the degreaser to the front and the back of each cabinet as well as to the frames. Wipe down and repeat these steps as necessary until the cabinet and frame are very clean., Whitewashing requires a blank canvas for the wood stain to take. Paint strippers will do the job, but these harsh chemicals require excellent ventilation (or a respirator), safety goggles, neoprene/latex gloves, and a drop cloth to protect your floor.Apply one coat of paint stripper with steel wool, then wipe with a rag once the finish has dissolved. Most paint strippers are flammable, so dispose of the steel wool and rag in a sealed metal bucket.   Alternatives:Furniture re-finisher: This more mild product may work if there are only one or two previous coats on the cabinet.Other paint strippers: if yours is ineffective, try a more powerful option. From weakest to harshest, these are varnish, lacquer, paint, and polyurethane removers., You can sand the surface by hand or by using a power sander. The goal is to uncover the natural color of the wood cabinets. When sanding, always move in the direction of the wood grain, rather than against it.   Sanding by hand: fold a quarter of a sheet of 120 grit sandpaper into thirds to make a pad that fits your palm. Wrap it around a block of wood to get a sharper edge to work into bevels and corners.Sheet sander: cheap power tool, sand in stages to 180 grit to avoid marks.Random orbital sander: fast and powerful, but requires purchasing more expensive sanding disks. Sand to 120 grit, and be careful not to nick cabinet edges., If your cabinets are made of a soft wood like pine, it's important to condition them as these woods can sometimes appear blotchy when stained. Conditioning also raises the grain of the wood. You can use a pre-stain conditioner for this step.   Apply the conditioner to the cabinets with a clean brush designed for latex paints and then let them sit for 30 minutes. Follow up with a light sanding of the cabinets using the 120 grit paper again. This final sanding will ensure the cabinets have a smooth surface to absorb the stain.Dewaxed shellac is an alternative option, if heavily diluted and wiped off fairly quickly. This is a risky method, so experiment on scrap lumber first. Alternatively, apply dewaxed shellac to the end grain to prevent over-staining that area. Wipe off unabsorbed excess, then sand lightly., Different stains will create warmer or darker tones to the cabinets, so consider your preferred tone and choose a wood stain that will work well in your home. Brands such as Minwax have a variety of different wood stains to choose from.Water-based wood stains produce fewer fumes, dry fast and clean-up easier than oil-based wood stains, but the color may fade quicker. Only use oil-based stains in a well-ventilated area.  Whenever you are applying stains of any type, it's a good idea to test the stain on a sample of scrap wood of the same wood-type as the piece you'll be working on.   Shake the can of stain thoroughly before you open the can and test the stain. This will mix in any pigments that have settled at the bottom of the can. Apply the stain to the scrap wood with a paintbrush and let it set for 2 to 3 minutes. Ensure you are happy with the results before moving on to the next step.  Using a clean rag, apply the stain with long, smooth strokes in the same direction and work the stain into the wood. Follow the line of the grain while accentuating any knots in the wood. Wipe away excess stain with another clean rag or a soft cotton cloth that you've folded into a pad. The more pressure you apply to the rag or the pad, the more the wood grain will show through the stain on the final product.If you are pickling oak cabinets, apply the pickling stain with a brush and wipe the stain against the grain. Due to the large pores and the natural grain pattern of oak, wiping against the grain is essential to working the stain down into the pores of the wood. Once you've worked the pickling stain into the pores of the wood, use a clean rag to wipe away any excess.If your rag becomes tacky as you are staining the cabinets, replace it with a clean rag., This should take about 1 to 2 days. If the surface is tacky to the touch, the wood stain is not completely set and will need more drying time.  While whitewashing enhances the wood grain, it does not offer any wood protection. To finish the cabinets, use non-yellowing protective top coat that will penetrate the wood's pours and protect the wood from within, such as a water-based lacquer, clear acrylic or natural Tung oil.   Apply the top coat with a high quality brush that is designed for latex or water-based products, so that stray bristles don't end up on your top coat. Use overlapping continuous strokes to finish the surface, a process called "striking off." Allow the first coat to dry for about 4 hours, and then lightly sand the cabinets one last time with 220 grit sandpaper. Use a tack cloth to wipe away any excess reside left behind by the sandpaper, and then apply a second and final coat to the cabinets.When you finish the bottom of the cabinet, place the cabinet on a small block or shims so that the polyacrylic doesn't stick to the surface of your work area. Avoid using oil-based protective finishes over whitewashing or pickling as these finishes have a yellowish look that will detract from the white coloring of the whitewash look., Hang the cabinets back in their exact positions, using the labelled screws and hardware.	Determine what type of wood your cabinets are made of. Detach the cabinet doors. Clean the doors. Strip the old stain from the doors. Sand the cabinets. Condition the wood. Choose a whitewash wood stain. Test the stain before you use it. Apply the stain to the cabinets. Let the cabinets dry completely. Finish the cabinets with a top coat. Re install your whitewash cabinets.

Some tongue twisters to practice with are:“Three free throws.” “She sells seashells by the seashore.” “The blue bluebird blinks.” “Freshly fried flying fish, freshly fried flesh.” “Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.”  , Do these exercises three to five times a week. Additionally, perform these exercises 30 minutes before speaking in public or for long periods of time.	Say “Mm-mmm.” Do this until you feel the front of your face buzz or vibrate. Alternate between “Mm-mm” and “Mm-hmm.” Say “Mm-mm” as in tummy, and “Mm-hmm” as in yes. Repeat “Ney ney ney.” Going up and down your vocal range, i.e. low to middle to high and back again, say “Ney ney ney ney ney.” Say it loudly, but do not yell.Repeat this exercise ten times.  , Practice saying tongue twisters. Practice these exercises regularly.
Check with your owners' manual to see what your manufacturer has to say about towing options, to help you decide which methods are compatible and most appropriate for your vehicle. Consider using one of the following devices if you do a lot of car-hauling.   One is a lube pump, which provides lubrication to the automatic transmission, in the same way as normal operation of the car would. This helps to prevent damage to the transmission. A drive shaft coupling device can be installed on a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. Instead of manually disconnecting and removing the drive shaft, this device lets you pull a lever to disconnect your drive shaft without having to get your hands dirty. An axle-lock is a device not at all dissimilar to the locking hubs found on older 4X4 vehicles, which can allow you to disconnect your wheels from their drive axles, and thus from the transmission.  This will require getting a little dirty, but if you want to tow your car on its own wheels, it is important to do this. You can also have a mechanic do this for you if you are not confident in your abilities.   The following steps cover how to disconnect the axles by yourself.  Raise it up if you must, being careful to leave it in park, or with the parking brakes on, wheel chocks or something to keep it from rolling off your jack or ramps. Bring your:   Ratchet set, or wrenches, some spray lube, and a bungee cord, a ratchet strap or some rope when you go under your car.  Then find the u-joint and on the end of that, the yoke, where four bolts can be found that hold the drive shaft to the differential housing.  Don't use your exhaust pipes or anything loose; look around to find something solid to connect it to. Don’t tighten this up just yet, but make sure to secure it so that the drive shaft doesn’t fall on to you when you loosen it.  The wrench or ratchet size you need will vary depending on the make and model of your car, and you might need to knock some dirt off and apply some spray-on lubricant to get them to come loose.   When the last bolt comes loose, use extra caution, as the drive shaft will fall unless it has been properly secured by your bungee chord.  Adjust your bungee or tighten the strap so there is as little wobble or play as possible. Don't force anything; you just want it up and out of the way and secure enough not to flop around or fall while you are towing the car.  No need to over-tighten the bolts; you should just put them back in this spot so that they do not get lost in the moving process.   You can also store them in a baggie in your glove box until after you have towed your car to your final destination.  The main idea here is to get your axles disconnected, and secure the drive shafts(s) well enough that they don't drop and hit pavement while you are towing the car.  When you get where you are going, use your strap to lower the axle back into range of the yoke so you can get the bolts back in. Check your manual for torque specs, or get those bolts in as securely as you can, and you're ready to drive again.	Consider using a special towing device. Decide to disconnect the axles. Get under your car. Locate the drive shaft(s), and find where it connects to the differential you want disconnected. Use your strap or bungee cord to secure the drive shaft to your undercarriage. Remove the four bolts. Push the drive shaft up as far as possible. Screw the bolts you removed back into the yoke on the differential housing. Repeat this process for your other axle, if you have one. Tow your car.
Place the paper towel tube right onto the tape, and use a marker to trace around it. These circles will cover the ends of your paper towel tube.  Use the gun to draw a line of glue all the way around the top edge of the paper towel tube. Place the circle, tape side out, onto the glue. Wait for the glue to set, then repeat this step for the other side. Trim off any excess cardboard from the edges.  Cut two 6 by 6 inch (15.24 by 15.24 centimeters) squares out of cardboard. Use hot glue to glue the two squares together. Make sure that the edges are aligned neatly. This will make your base.  Be sure to cover the ends of the paper towel tube as well. Do not attach the pieces together just yet, however. You to cover them first before assembling them.   If you don't want to use duct tape, consider using fabric instead. You can also paint it using spray paint or acrylic paint, but the texture of the tubes will show through.  The flat part of each half circle should be aligned with the top edge of the tube. The half circles will make the grooves for the paper towel tube to sit on., Draw a line of hot glue down each groove. Find the center of the paper towel tube, and press it right into the glue.   If you want to hide the seams between the top of the toilet paper tube and the sides of the paper towel tube, fold a long strip of duct tape over the top of the paper towel tube, and press the two ends down the sides of the toilet paper tube.  Draw a thick line of hot glue around the bottom edge of the toilet paper tube. Find the center of the base, and stick it down.   If the glue is not strong enough, you may have to reinforce it with more duct tape.	Use the bottom of the paper towel tube to trace two circles onto a sheet of cardboard. Cut the circles out and hot glue them to each end of the paper towel tube. Make your base. Cover the toilet paper tube, the paper towel tube, and the cardboard base with duct tape. Cut two half circles into the top of the toilet paper tube. Hot glue the paper towel tube into the grooves. Hot glue the toilet paper tube onto the base.
Private sellers expect to be paid by cash or check, in-full and upfront, and cannot provide financing. However, private sellers tend to be quite a bit cheaper than dealerships, making an all-at-once payment more beneficial. Note, however, that consumer protection laws do not apply to private sellers.Check the Kelley Blue Book value of any car you are considering.   Apply for financing through a bank if you cannot pay the total cost of the car upfront. If you do not have enough saved you should consider a personal loan from a bank. The total cost of this can vary considerably depending on your credit score. Apply for this financing before you approach a seller. Look up the laws in your state regarding private sales. In nearly every state, caveat emptor ('Buyer Beware") applies. Basically, this means that once the money changes hands, you have no legal recourse or warranty if things go bad, even the day after you buy the car. You'd have to get any warranty in writing, preferably on the bill of sale.; , Consider whether you will haul large loads, transport groups of people, the distance you will regularly travel, as well as the terrain. Plan for everyday use, and not edge-cases to avoid searching for cars that exceed your needs. This will help you filter what kind of vehicle you are looking for.  Look through auto classifieds, online, in your local paper, and through friends and family. Online sources like Craigslist can allow you to quickly sort through and filter sellers. Sellers are competing in a saturated market, so be discriminating in which ads you choose to make a response.  Ads that are not descriptive or detailed often indicate that the seller is being disingenuous. The more information you are able to readily verify in the ad, the better. You will also be able to compare any asking price against a market price. Once you know the car's basics, look up similar models to compare prices.   Note that terms like "clean," and "runs great" are not legally enforceable terms, nor particularly helpful for a buyer. Focus on miles, any recent mechanical work needed, make, model, and year of the car.  Try not to call too late in the evening or too early in the morning - the seller may not be able to talk for long and tell you about the car. The seller should be easy to reach through the contact information in the ad, if not avoid further contact, as this might be a scam.   If you want to negotiate the price of the car, know what price you're looking for now. It might not come up yet, and likely shouldn't, but you should have this idea from your budget earlier. Only contact sellers if you're interested in actually buying the car. Showing and testing a used car takes time, and the seller doesn't want to hold on other offers if you're not serious.  Any damage or wear can factor in to the price, so compare this against the asking price. Ask why the vehicle is being sold. Make a note of this information to compare later against the actual facts as they evolve.   If the seller is unable or unwilling to give any of this information, go ahead and walk away. This is a huge red flag.  The time should work for both of you and the meeting should be in a public area if you do not know the seller. You should prepare for this meeting by having all your information and questions ready. Keep the seller apprised of any changes in your schedule for the meeting.   Only meet the seller if you can also see the car. If they just want to meet in person, they're wasting your time.  If you don't know a lot about auto mechanics, brings someone along with you for the best results. Private sellers may keep records of any repairs or maintenance done on the vehicle, and this will tell you the general health of the car. If they do not know the history, you'll absolutely need to do a thorough check through the DMV.   Ask if they have made any modifications ("mods") to the car, and who did them. Ask, at the very least, for the mechanical history of the car since the current owner bought it. If they made repairs or changes themselves, it is up to you whether or not you trust them.  The DMV has a record of any accidents involving the car, as does CarFax.com, so that you can do a more detailed search. Use the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), located on the steering column in the interior, on the engine, or etched on the windshield, to get specific car information.   The most likely location of the VIN is on the lower left-hand corner of the windshield (looking from the driver's seat).  Check the body for obvious damage or signs of previous heavy repairs, the tires for any obvious defects such as cracks or under-inflation or excessive wear, and the engine for any signs of physical damage. Use a small pocket magnet to find areas ,where plastic putty was used to repair body damages. A paint thickness tester with a digital display will help to detect clunkers. Be aware of the fact that private sellers are not prevented in any way from selling damaged cars, and can hide the origin of the car through title washing, a process of selling a car and re-registering it in a new state., Mineral deposits, discoloration, water stains on the interior, strong odor from cleaners, or deposited flotsam are all sure indicators of water damage. Any water damage to the engine or interior of the car is likely to leave the car totaled.  Check in the wheel wells, the rockers, the floorboards, and trunk. Repairing or reversing rust is an expensive process. Indicators of shoddy bodywork include mismatched paint, use of plastic or fiberglass filler, or gaps between body panels.  The odometer is generally reliable, but wear on seat upholstery and the pedals are sure indicators of use as well. You should be alert when you find new pedal rubbers! The Kelley Blue Book offers a calculator for the price impact of mileage. Have this calculator handy. Note, however, that Kelly Blue Book prices will vary from zip code to zip code, so check prices in your own town, not where you buy the car.  If they are worn unevenly, the car may need front end repairs to the alignment, shocks, tires or tie rods. While replacing the tires can be relatively inexpensive, any obvious and significant damage would make the car unsafe to test drive.   A new set of tires can be a potential red flag -- as this is an odd expense to pay before selling the car. Make sure you pay specific attention to braking and handling when test driving.  Batteries are cheap and easy to replace. If the terminals are corroded it is an indication of poor maintenance. Avoid test driving the car if the battery appears too corroded, it could spark or start a fire.  Make sure there is no oil on the air filter, or near the air intake. This could indicate blown pistons or other engine damage. If you are unsure of how to check this, have an experienced mechanic show you. Again, a brand new air filter can be a red flag, as it might be a way to cover or postpone engine failure. That said, these cheap parts are easy to replace and should be replaced often, so as long as it's not brand new without an explanation you should be fine.  The oil from the dipstick should be black and free from grit. The coolant should not have any particulate matter in it, or be sludgy or brown. This indicates serious issues with the engine that make the car unsafe and costly to repair.   If the oil is red or green it is probably brand new. Again, if the seller is not upfront about this it can be a red flag that she/he is hiding bigger issues.  It should smell sweet and have little particulate matter. Burnt orange or brown fluid means it hasn't been changed in a long time. Avoid test driving the car if there are issues with the transmission, as it locking up or otherwise breaking could cause an accident. This is for automatic transmissions.   For a manual transmission, check the clutch master cylinder for leaks etc; and the clutch pedal it shouldn't feel either too stiff or too loose. Does the shifter hang up or pop out of gear? Those would be deal enders for me.  Run the heat and the air conditioning to see how well they run. The air conditioning may need coolant to improve cooling. The fan should blow without any obstruction or excessive noise.  Drive as you normally would, for a period of time that is sensible. This includes freeway and city driving. Keep an eye on the engine temperature, ease of steering and the ease of shifting gears, as well as the status of check engine light. You can monitor the gear shifts by observing the tachometer’s rise and fall with acceleration. Many minor repairs can be accomplished relatively quickly . Keep the stereo off so that you can listen into the car for dangerous sounds or unwelcome noises. You can test the sound system, but make it quick. Try to drive, if possible, at a variety of speeds and locations. Get on a near highway and open it up, then try to slower, more precise turning on slower roads.  Unlike with a dealership, you must handle all the required paperwork to purchase the car. You can contact your local DMV to secure any papers needed to pay sales tax, transfer the title and registration, and any other legalities involved in purchasing the car . Ensure that you have established the source your financing, either through earnings or a loan, before you attempt to buy the vehicle.   If the seller doesn't have the title in hand, walk way. Don't accept stories about it being lost or gone. Similarly, make sure you have your cash and any required paperwork ready.  In some states, emissions tests are required before the sale of a vehicle, and this will allow you to catch any issues you might have missed during your test drive. The seller should be receptive to this if not, walk away from the deal because this is an indication of major needed repairs.  Although you may be accustomed to fixed prices, this an occasion where you often have leverage and can offer a below Blue Book valuation.. Negotiation is acceptable in this situation, and if you have cash on hand, you can pressure the seller to a lower price.   Consider the incentives of the seller. The seller often is motivated to sell the car privately because of a poor offer from a dealership. The seller is generally aware of the market value of the car and generally willing to sell below that value. You can use this to your advantage in negotiating the price., If your seller accepts your offer, fill out and mutually sign all the required paperwork, and make the payment. This should be sufficient to temporarily secured the title until you get the car legally registered in your name . If you are stopped by police without this under your name, the car may be considered stolen.	Set aside a definite budget. Consider your transportation needs. Shortlist cars. Analyze the information in the ad. Contact the seller at a reasonable hour. During this phone call verify the make, model, year, mileage, vehicle identification number and general condition of the vehicle. Schedule an appointment to see the actual car and take it for a spin. Ask for a maintenance history for the vehicle. Use the VIN to do a detailed car history search. Make a thorough inspection of the vehicle, with the engine off and on. Inspect the vehicle for any signs of water damage. Inspect the car for any rust or body damage. Examine the mileage on the vehicle. Check the tires, especially the front, for wear. Examine the battery. Check the air filter. Examine the engine’s coolant and oil levels while the car is off. Check the transmission fluid with the engine running. Check the climate control in the car. Test drive the car. Make sure the seller has all the necessary paperwork. Have a professional mechanic inspect the car and perform any necessary tests at your expense as mechanics tend to favor the person paying for the inspection. Make an offer if the car suits you. Get the signed title from the seller.
The goal of a song is to express an idea. This could be very simplistic or complicated, but it has to come from somewhere, and mean something to you. Some of the best places people seek inspiration are at coffee shops, where lovers and/or friends meet up, talk, kiss, and interact. Other songwriters like going out into the woods where they can hear the birds chirping, and experience the awesome solemnity of nature.Look for a place which suits your needs. If you need interaction, go to a crowded place. If you need silence, take a drive or sit by the lake. Spend some time using all of your sensory abilities. Look to see the colors around you, listen to the sounds you hear, feel the table in front of you, and smell the multitude of aromas. The ideas you come up with don't necessarily have to be serious or intricate. Especially when it comes to pop songs, short, sweet, and upbeat thoughts are especially welcome.; , Grab a sheet of paper and a pencil/pen when you go to seek your inspiration. Every time you hear, touch, smell, or see something interesting, write a word or two down which represents it. For example, I hear a bird calling in the woods so I write down "feather, echo, call, hear me." Compile a large list of these as you travel to different locations and seek inspiration from elsewhere.Carry a small 2X4 inch journal in your pocket when you travel. This way you will have a way to keep your ideas contained together, and always have something to write an idea down on. Put stars around, or underline words which weigh on you heavily. These might be words you want to focus on when you later write your song.  You do not want to write a song about love, death, depression, working, dreams, and learning who you are. One of those works just fine, and will help to focus the minds of your listeners later on. Take your random word lists, and begin to cross certain words off. Begin a permanent list on another piece of paper.Each of these important words should center on one topic. For example, "gravel, breeze, going home, rough road, time, open space" would center around the concept of "taking your own path in life." Begin to connect and number the words in the order you want them in your song. Using the previous example, "1. open space, 2. breeze, 3. rough road, 4. going home." You need some open space so you go on a car ride. During the car ride you experience the breeze of the outside air. However, you begin to feel how rough the road is, so you decide to make your way back home. It is important that the topic you choose is relatable to everyone. Since this will be a pop song, it is going to be popular to a wide range of audiences. For example, topics like sadness or longing might be more relatable to a general audience than depression.  Every topic has already been sung about, whether it be love, sadness, happiness, longing, hope, trustworthiness, etc. The key is to either say something new about it, or say it in a different way. This is where the use of metaphor really comes in handy. The descriptions you pick up on can be transformed into a highly engaging topic about an old conversation.For example, you might notice the way a bird's feathers flutter in the wind. You can then use this detail as a metaphor for the way your life is going, i.e. up and down. Rather than just explicitly saying "up and down" you use a metaphor that explains your thinking. Paint a picture with these metaphors. Do not string a whole bunch of them together randomly. For instance, if you are using the bird metaphor, stick with the bird. Talk about the way it dives, eats, sleeps, breathes, etc. That vivid imagery will capture the imaginations of your song listeners.  Don't worry about rhyming yet, as much as writing your lyrics in complete sentences. Take your important words and build around them with active verbs, adjectives, etc. Write your lyrics as if you were writing a movie script. Tell a story using "you" more than you use "I."The basic structure of a pop song goes: verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, chorus, interlude, chorus. There are two sets of verses where you can really get into telling your story. The first verse will introduce your listener to the story. The second verse can either repeat the same sentiment of the first verse, or change the direction of your story. The chorus has to be the same every time you sing it in order for the listener to latch on to the song. This part of the song should clearly represent the main idea you are driving at. If your song is about going home, tell the listener you are going home, either manifestly (I'm going home) or latently (I'm going back to the place where it began). Remember, some part of the chorus will likely become the title of your song.  Before you begin tweaking/altering your lyrics, you will want to figure out the general beat of your song. The rhythm will tell your listeners, even without words, the mood of your song. For songs about sadness, or longing, the rhythm is usually slower, while happy songs are generally more upbeat.Above each word, write full, half, or quarter notes. This will let you know how long you want to sing each word. Sad songs have a lot more full notes, while happy songs are generally full of quarter, and sometimes even eighth notes. The chorus, of either a sad or happy pop song, will have a consistent rhythm throughout the song. When it comes to verses, sad songs have a more freewheeling style. They can go slower or faster, and change up in between. Happy songs should have both consistent chorus lines and verses respectively throughout.  This is probably the most important part of a pop song. Pop songs are played on a radio, and therefore, there is a short time to "hook" the audience. The hook of your song draws them in and keeps them interested. Sit down at a piano, or pull out your guitar. Begin practicing different riffs. Alternate the riff to suit your particular song.One of the best examples of a riff is "Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones. The entry to this song immediately gets the audience hooked. Note that the riff does not necessarily have to be the same as the melody or rhythm. The hook can be used solely at the beginning to draw the audience in, or it can be used throughout and remain in the background. A song like "Satisfaction" uses the riff throughout, while a song like "Train, Train" by Blackfoot only uses a harmonica riff at the very beginning.  There is no perfect formula for this as there is a different melody for every song ever made. However, pop songs generally hand a mixture of repetition and variation that make the song easy to remember. Read the words of your song out loud, over and over again, until your mind begins to attach some notes to the words.One way to find inspiration for a melody is to listen to other pop songs. You might find a melody someone else used, and create a variation on it. After you have figured out a melody for the first line of a verse, apply it to the second as well. Change the melody for the third line, and then come back to the original melody for the fourth. This is a common pattern in pop songs which creates a level of repetition that a general audience likes (1, 1, 2, 1). Remember that melodies will change when you transition from verses to chorus lines. Pop songs have strong chorus melodies which allow the singer to belt out and become emotional (either happy or sad). Have the peak notes of your song fall within the chorus, such as extreme high notes and/or long notes.  Pop songs generally use 3 or 4 note chord progressions. Type into Google the name of any song followed by the word "chord" and it will tell you what chords were used. For example, the song "Firework" by Katy Perry has the following chord progression: | G | Am | Em | C | Chord progressions for pop songs, like in "Firework" are repeated for the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus.You can use chord progressions from other songs, just not lyrics or melodies. However, feel free to add or change one of the notes to suit your song best. If you repeat a chord progression, change the scale you play it in. This creates some level of variation between the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus. For example, "Firework" has a steady low chord progression for the first verse. The pre-chorus ranges from low to high, and the chorus is a steady high chorus progression. Once you have figured out what chords you would like, you can go back and attach it to the rhythm and melody. You may want to add/delete words in your lyrics as join together the rhythm, melody, and chords.  This usually comes after you sing the chorus a second time, and before the third time. It could be a guitar solo or a piano solo. The singer might want to belt out long notes with various modulations in their voice. This interlude should flow naturally from the song, rather than being an interjection.For example, you can build on notes in chorus lines. The first time you sing the chorus, sing notes relatively short. The second time, sing them longer, stretching them out. You can then go straight into a bridge which allows you to sing the same notes for as long as you want. Mix it up. A lot of pop songs might start an interlude with long, belted notes and then transition into a piano or guitar solo. The options are nearly endless. Reel the interlude back in so that you can end the song. Remember, you want distinguished lines between the different sections.  A common way to end a pop song is to simply repeat the chorus line over and over again as the song fades away. Many Aerosmith songs such as "Love in an Elevator" use this fading action a lot. It is best used for loud, rhythmic, hard edged chorus lines. Other, more sad songs might end better coming back to your original starting point. If you started off slow and soft, bring it back there, to effectively "close" your story.You can also end your song on an instrumental, however, this is usually an artistic license allotted to bands which already have names for themselves. For example, the ending to Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" is over five minutes worth of instrumentals. However, you can play your basic riff a couple of times at the end of your song, just begging your audience to repeat and play again.  After you have finished adding the music to your lyrics, you will want to go back and add your rhymes in. In modern day pop songs, there is more "free-styling" when it comes to lyrics but there is still a basic rhyme format. The trick of the pop song is to make it easy to remember, and rhymes facilitate that.Type a word into Google and add "rhymes with" next to it. A list of words will pop up and help you decide on which word best fits. Depending on the particular word choices you may have to go back and change some of the melody/rhythm. This is a back and forth, give and take process.  Use the strengths of the people around you to help make your song better. Find out whether a person you know plays an instrument. For example, if you are doing a very upbeat pop song, you might want someone who knows how to play a trumpet, or someone who is a good DJ.Other friends or family might be able to lend their voices to your effort, and harmonize with your melody. You might also want to ask around for anybody that has an "in" into the music business. Someone who has already recorded an album, or who has worked with a record company, might be able to get your song some radio air time.  Record it on your computer or stereo. Listen back and see if you can follow it. The words should sound crisp and clear as they will be memorized by millions of pop song listeners. There should be clear, distinguished lines between the verses, pre-chorus line, and chorus lines. Your interlude should flow naturally with the rest of the song, rather than intrude on its progression.Pop songs, like other songs, are never perfect the first go around. Rerecord the song until it is exactly right. Note how you feel during the song. The essence of a good pop song is if you can feel the emotions you are trying to convey.  This can literally be anything you want it to be, but it should have something to do with your topic. Often times pop songs have titles which use lines from the chorus. This makes it easier for a general audience to look up your song later on. However, if your song is very metaphorical, you may want to give your song a more obvious title.For example, if your song is about depression, but you never explicitly say it in the song, your title should reflect it.	Seek inspiration or influence. Brainstorm different ideas. Focus your ideas on a singular topic. Say something old in a new way. Construct an outline for your lyrics. Attach a rhythm groove to your outlined lyrics. Begin your song with a hook. Decide on a melody for your song. Create a chord progression. Add a bridge or interlude. End your song. Copy edit your lyrics and notes. Collaborate with family, friends, or partners. Listen to your song. Come up with a title for your song.
sounded together. If you speak of only two notes that are to be sounded then that is known as an interval (like a distance). The C chord made of the notes "C-E-G" some indicated sharps and flats -- which would make whole different chords. Double click the photo to see it larger.  "C" chord:       "F" chord:       "G" chord: The simpler three note chords shown above are major chords in order "C, F, and G" that are made up of only white keys spaces exactly the same way.       Notice that C chord is exactly the same shape (same fingering) as F and G chords in the photos using sticky notes on a keyboard above... but C shown as three notes on lines of sheet music also shows that concept These three note chords are called triads or triadic formed by a "formula" like a pattern. Chords may have more than three notes (not needed for this basic accompaniment work): for example, a chord of 4, 5 or 6 notes are called tetrads, pentads and hexads (also called tetrachords, pentachords and hexachords).  Also, some chords may be complicated by spaced out combinations of notes that are called "perfect," "augmented," or "diminished", etc. for more complex chords.	Understand chords generally consist of at least "three" notes/pitches/tones (Let's call them notes.)
You won't always have time to buy items before a hurricane strikes, especially when the storm is imminent, so you'll want to store the necessary items in your home well in advance.  This should include dried foods that you can rehydrate with bottled water and non-perishable foods. Include a manual can opener and any other supplies you might want to use to prepare food in the event you lose power and access to supplies for an extended period of time.  You should have bottled water on hand. Some people will clean and rinse their bathtubs and fill them with tap water to use as additional drinking water during a hurricane.  These will come in handy if clothes are soiled or ruined due to floodwaters or debris.  You may want to store these in waterproof containers or a safe as well. , Have a radio that can work with battery power so you can monitor the storm and keep up with the latest hurricane advisories. You may also want a first aid kit, extra batteries and a flashlight.  You may need to modify an area of your home during your hurricane preparation. Others will be able to use an area in the home without windows that will be safe from flooding.	Put together supplies to prepare for hurricanes. Purchase or create a food kit. Prepare for hurricanes with a supply of drinking water. Store an extra set of clothes, warm socks and a pair of shoes in a waterproof container for each family member. Move all valuables and paperwork to the upper floors of your home. Keep a stack of blankets or sleeping bags handy.  , Collect items you may need. Determine the best place in your home to go during a hurricane.
A common tradition in Japanese culture, karaoke shows up frequently in anime. Find a friend with an old karaoke machine or a singing game on a game console and ask if they want to have a karaoke night. Find a local hangout that offers karaoke and sign up. Take a step out of your comfort zone and give it a try.   In Japanese culture, karaoke is often performed in a private room with friends rather than on a stage in front of strangers.  Anime characters don’t usually sit inside staring at a TV. If you spend a lot of time inside, start going outside more. Explore the woods behind your house. Go walk around downtown and meet strangers. Book a camping trip, hike a mountain, or travel to a faraway place.   Adventures don’t have to be planned down to the minute. You could just start walking or driving and see where you end up. It’s about going into the unknown.  Most anime character end up at an onsen, or hot spring bath, at some point in their travels. If you live in Japan, an onsen shouldn’t be hard to find. Other places may take more searching. Anything similar to a hot spring or public hot bath will work. In anime and Japanese culture, these baths often require nudity.   Outside of Japan, you may not find a traditional onsen bath, but you could visit other natural hot springs and at least have a similar experience.  Find a local Comic-Con or anime convention and design a cosplay costume for your favorite character. Act out the character’s personality with the other people you meet. If you can’t find a convention, invite a bunch of friends over for a cosplay party and have games that incorporate the characters.   Cosplay for your next costume party or other events where you get to dress up like a character. Try out different versions of the same character if you have more than one opportunity.	Perform karaoke. Go outside and have adventures. Visit an onsen. Develop a cosplay of your favorite character.
With your breath, make a little "bump" in the sound by letting more air through for just a moment before going back to your normal air stream. The note should get louder during the bump. Practice this technique––it should be easy. The bump/breath should come from your belly and diaphragm. If you are a singer, you know how important it is to use your whole stomach and lungs to get good air. You may need to tense your core a bit to control your sound.; , You can also just keep basic time in your head or by tapping your foot. Make a bump in the sound on every beat for several measures. Slowly, increase the speed of your beat/metronome. It will take some time to get it right, but don't worry, with practice it will sound better as you practice more.  It is extremely important to use your core and air to stay steady and even with your beats. This is why you shouldn't jump to faster tempos before you've gotten the slower ones down-pat. Also keep dynamics in time. Focus on your sound, and make sure the dynamics are generally even on each beat.  If you're confident, try seeing how long you can go for. If your tone is bad, it doesn't count, so make sure your tone is doing well. After a few exercises, you may choose to practice increasing the tempo even more.  Don't start with fast pieces; you need to take it slowly to begin with. Start with a sonata or something similar. You will need to rely on your personal opinion on what notes should have vibrato. Long notes usually do, and some people do it with every note, even in fast pieces like marches. Using vibrato in pieces can be much harder, but it is easy to get the hang of once you've done it well.  By now, you are a vibrato expert! Make sure you aren't hard on yourself if you don't get the hang of it immediately. These skills take time.	Pick a note that is generally very easy to play, such as a b-flat or a D. Take a deep breath, and start your note. Start a metronome on a moderate tempo in 4/4. Keep increasing your beat until it sounds more like a full vibrato. Practice until you can do a generally moderate vibrato with an even tone. Integrate the vibrato into a piece of music. Slowly increase your speed or move to faster/more complicated pieces.
Most base model vehicles come pre-wired, allowing the manufacturer or a service technician to upgrade and install a car radio. Or, the original factory installed radio may be missing or defective. In either case, the electrical connections to the power source and speakers could be intact.   Locate the wiring harness to assess its condition. The antennae and power wires should also be inspected before proceeding. If any wires on the harness or in the dash are damaged or frayed, speak to a sales consultant at an electronics store about replacement kits.; , There are many aftermarket stereo systems that can retrofit in the dashboard of a Toyota pickup. Depending on how much money you have to spend, installing a car stereo system can allow you to enhance your driving experience with additional features.   Review the optional features at the electronics store. Navigation devices, MP3, even video players are features incorporated in modern high tech car audio systems.  Disconnect the battery in your vehicle. Remove any cover that may hide the empty space where the radio should fit. Be careful not to break any plastic components. If you are replacing or upgrading a radio, remove the screws in the face plate or other covers with the appropriate screwdriver and pull the old unit out. Disconnect wiring.  Make sure the new car radio fits snugly in the opening on the dash. If the unit is too tight, check for any springs, wires, or other obstacles. Return the unit for exchange if it does not slide in securely without being forced.   Attach all the wiring, including the antennae, the hot wire power source, and the wiring harness. Verify all connections are snapped together correctly.  Reconnect the vehicle's battery terminals. Following the manufacturer's instruction manual, turn the radio on and verify that all speaker connections are working properly. Test the equalizer, the fade and balance controls, and all other functions, including, if applicable, CD, MP3, and other features. Adjust the clock and other programmable features.	Determine if your Toyota pickup is pre-wired. Decide on the type of car radio you want to install. Remove old radio or existing covers. Prepare to install the new unit. Test the new radio thoroughly.
This section will give you a few tips on how you can decorate your classroom bulletin board. You do not have to use all of the ideas in this section. Choose a few that appeal the most to you.   You can buy most of the supplies in a teacher supply store. Some well-stocked art stores may also carry these supplies.  Most classroom bulletin boards use solid-colored butcher paper. This hides the corkboard and make it look more colorful. You can be more creative and use wrapping paper or colorful fabric instead.   Wrapping paper is great because it adds a lot of texture and pattern. You might want to use a solid-colored background and letters, as well as large, simple shapes, when decorating it. This will keep the designs from clashing. Fabric is great because pins and staples won't leave holes in it. It also won't fade, rip, or tear. If it wrinkles, all you have to do is iron it out., Most borders will be either solid-colored or patterned (and usually based off of a holiday, such as hearts for Valentine's day and shamrocks for St. Patrick's day). However, you can use almost anything you want for the border. Here are some ideas:   Consider layering the border. Lay two to three pieces on top of each other.Each bottom piece should be sticking out from beneath the upper one by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Use paper cutouts, such as hearts, snowflakes, leaves, or clover, to make your border. They should be smaller than your hand. Try to use different shades to add variety. For example, if you are using hearts, use red and pink paper. Use other items for borders, such as pompoms, playing cards, fake flowers, or even crumpled tissue paper.  Most bulletin boards will use the same color and font for each word or phrase. You can make your board look more interesting by using different colors, sizes, and fonts for the letters. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Use a different font for each word. Make one word bold and the other cursive or italic. Use a different color or pattern for each word. Make the words you want to emphasize larger. Make your own unique letters by tracing letters onto patterned scrapbook paper, and then cutting the letters out. Get a pennant banner (it looks like paper squares or rectangles attached to a long string) and write each letter on each pennant.  This is a great way to tie in what you are teaching at the moment to the rest of the classroom. Here are some ideas to get you started:   If the class is learning about ancient Egypt, write the message on the board using hieroglyphics. You can use colored butcher paper to create a desert scene, including sand, palm trees, and pyramids. For an English classroom, you could make the bulletin board book or grammar related. If your students are studying a particular book, then base the bulletin board off of that book. Include the name of the book, as well as a phrase. You can even include a symbol or some characters from the book as well.  These sorts of decorations can stay up for the entire month that the holiday takes place in. They are a great way to make your classroom look more festive. Here are some ideas to get you started:   For Valentine's day, use a soft pink or white for the background, and red for the borders and letters. Consider decorating the board with a Valentine's day craft project that the kids did. Leave the decorations up for all of February. For Halloween, use orange for the background, and black for the boards and letters. Decorate the board with black cats and bats. You can even add a cobweb and a spider to the corner. Leave the decorations up for all of October. For St. Patrick's day, green for the background, and white for the letters and board. Use colored butcher paper to create a rainbow and a pot of gold. Leave the decorations up for all of March.  Students have to spend a lot of their time indoors. This does not mean that they have to miss out on all that the seasons have to offer. You can decorate your board according to the season. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Use lots of earth tones for fall. For example, use tan for the background and red or orange for the borders and letters. Staple paper pumpkins and red, orange, and yellow fall leaves to the board. Use lots of blue and white for winter. For example, use light blue for the background and white for the borders and letters. Create a snow scene using white butcher paper and lots of paper snowflakes. You can also use green butcher paper to create pine trees. Use bright colors for spring. For example, use light blue for the background and a cheerful yellow for the border and letters. Decorate the board using bright green paper for the grass, and pink, purple, and white paper for the flowers. Use tropical colors for summer. Use a light blue for the background and yellow for the border and letters. You can decorate the board with colorful hibiscus flowers, seashells, palm trees, and a sun.  It will also save you the trouble of having to buy supplies to decorate it with. Try not to staple the student's artwork to the board, as this can create holes and ruin it. Instead, try to use some poster putty instead. It comes off of paper easily. Most people use it to stick posters to walls.   If you must staple the artwork, try staple only the top of the artwork. Do not get too close to the edge, however; the art piece by rip off, creating a tear in the student's artwork. This could end in lots of tears.	Create a custom board. Use a background. Get creative with borders. Play with the words. Base it off of something the students are currently studying. Base the decorations on your board off of a holiday. Base the colors and decorations on your board off of a season. Hang the students' artwork on it.This is a great way to make your board look more colorful.
If you're not sure what to do on the dance floor, just bounce to the beat. You do this by bending your knees slightly and then standing back up to the beat. This can be a very small, fast move that makes you look like you're just bobbing along to the music, or a much larger, pronounced motion where you're exaggerating the bends and the pauses.Try shifting your body from side to side so you don't look like a buoy in the water.          A variation is to sway back and forth to the music. Make sure your legs are shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Instead of bouncing, just sway back and forth. Try pausing for a beat when you get to the side.Keep your shoulders relaxed. Being too stiff will interfere with the movements; you want to be smooth as you groove. Let your arms sway as you bounce. Just find the tempo of the music and start moving to it. If you're unsure how to find the tempo, listen for the drums and the bass line. Listen for the thump-thump-thump pattern in the undertone of the song.; , If you're just bouncing along to the music, try bending your arms at about 45 degree angles. Keeping them at about chest height, move them up and down to the beat of the music. Don't worry about being rigid - let your arms flow as they move. Point your fist towards your shoulder or hip, have one arm up high while the other is low. Vary where you place your arms as you dance; don't keep them in one position. Move with what feels right for the music.  As you are bouncing and moving your arms around, don't keep your head there, stiff and unmoving. Nod your head to the music.Turn your head from side to side as you look around the room. Look down at the ground, and then glance up to the ceiling. Do a combination of all these head moves to keep it fluid as you change it up.  Another dance move is to roll your shoulders to the beat. Hang your arms down by your side, and starting with the right shoulder, roll it backwards. Then, roll the left shoulder backwards. Alternate as you bounce and sway to the music.          You can also add your arms by lifting one arm as you roll that shoulder, then lifting the other arm while lowering the one you just lifted. Keep it a fluid motion as you dance., Another common basic club dance move is rolling your hips around. As you bounce or move your body to the beat, add some hip action. Move your hips from side to side as you bounce or roll them in circles.          One way to get some hip movements is to write the letters of your name with your hips. Move your hips as if you are making the outline of the letters. Just remember to keep it in time with the music.  The simplest club dance move you can do is the two-step. To dance the two-step, just step your right leg to the side, then move your left leg to meet it. Then do the same thing on the other side. Find the beat of the music and step to the side.          To make this move less rigid, move your body in an up and down bouncing motion. This gives you a bit more movement as you step from side to side.Engage your upper body by moving your torso off-center, so you're leaning in one direction or the other. You can also lean forwards and backwards, changing up the position of your upper body every time you step to the side., A variation of the two-step is the step behind. Start by stepping your right leg to the side. Instead of stepping the left foot to meet your right one, pull it behind you and tap the toe of your second foot behind your heel. Then step out with the left foot and bring your right leg behind it to tap.          To mix it up, push the second foot in front of you, tapping in front of the toe with your opposite heel as you lean back., The step clap is similar to the two-step, but adds in the arms. Step from side to side, clapping your hands when you get to the side. Try to clap your hands along to the rhythm of the music.          After you get the hang of the step clap, you can make it wider by stepping out in a larger range of motion. Try bending your knees lower or swaying your upper body along with the movement., Start with your legs shoulder-width apart. Pivot on your feet, turning your body slightly towards one side. When your body gets to the side, pause and hold. While you are paused, drop your back shoulder slightly, which makes you lean away slightly. As you drop and lean, snap the fingers on the hand on that side. Move back to center, then pivot in the other direction and perform the same steps with the other arm.  Hold your hands above your head. Move your arms in a large circular motion through the air. To add the legs, make a 90 degree turn with each circle of your arms. Lead with the outside foot, so that the inside foot stays mostly still, like you are pivoting around that leg.         Each turn should follow a 2-step rhythm. On one, you step with the outer foot; on two, you rotate your inner foot. The arms follow a similar tempo. With each beat, your arms should complete half a circle. On one, your arms are to one side; on two, your arms circle back to start.  Before you head out, search for videos of club dance moves. Some of these videos just feature people dancing to club music, others take you through tutorials of how to master the moves. Watching these videos can help give you a mental picture of the moves that you can imitate.  If you're extremely worried about what you look like, tape yourself dancing to club music to make sure your moves look okay. Fix anything you find strange about your movements. Compare it to videos you see online.   Look for things like not enough movement, being too stiff, arms being too rigid, and awkward head movements.  Get dressed up and go to the club with a group of friends. This can help you feel relaxed and less self-conscious, which will help you perform the dance moves much more confidently.   One of the worst things you can do at a club is overthink your moves. Overthinking makes you rigid and awkward. Be careful not to do spastic moves where you are flailing all over the dance floor either.  When you first get to the club, scope out the other people on the dance floor. See how they are dancing, what they look like, what kind of moves they are doing. More than likely, they will be doing some of the same basic dance moves you will be. Don't stress and have fun.   Relaxing also helps you stay loose. If you're feeling tense, just start moving around to warm up and loosen your muscles. Roll your shoulders, stretch your neck from side to side, sway as you bounce a bit. This helps you get the key body parts moving so you can dance more fluidly.	Bounce to the beat. Bend your arms and move them up and down. Nod your head. Roll your shoulders. Roll your hips. Do the two-step. Try the step behind. Use the step clap. Do the step drop. Try the circle turn. Watch videos of club dance moves. Tape yourself dancing. Go with a group of friends. Relax.
The value of 90 percent silver coins (minted prior to 1964) tends to vary directly with the activity of the silver bullion market. However, in the case of rare silver coins, the precious metal content has little influence on the coins’ ultimate value.; ,   Find the mint mark. Coins minted prior to 1968 will usually have mint marks on the reverse, while coins minted after 1968 will have mint marks on the front. The mint mark tells you where the coin was made. Note the year of the coin. When you know the location and the year of the coin, you can find out how many copies of the coin were minted at that time by checking a coin price guide or a coin encyclopedia. Coin lines with fewer minted copies tend to be more valuable than coin lines in which many copies were minted. Search coin encyclopedias for any major varieties or errors. Some years and mints will have rare doubled die errors, or variations in the designs of the coins, especially with popular older coins that may be silver, such as Morgan Dollars. Particularly with Morgan Dollar Varieties (VAM Varieties), there are numerous variations for each year/mint and some command a very large premium. Varieties can be particularly rare and valuable even if the year and mint is common.    Examine the luster. The luster is the degree to which light reflects from a coin’s surface. Microscopic lines in the design will impact luster, and luster will diminish as the coin’s surface finish wears away. Notice the color. Color can be negatively altered if the coins have been chemically cleaned. Look for vibrancy of color and the natural hue of silver. Look for detracting marks, like fingerprints, that result from improper packaging or handling. Evaluate overall eye appeal. Eye appeal is influenced by carbon streaks, vinyl damage, and other striking defects. While this category is a bit subjective, factors that detract from a coin’s overall appearance will lessen its value.  Series that are rarer or have a higher demand will price higher than more common series.   Check a site like eBay and evaluate the price of the coin. If a coin is rare, people tend to bid the price up to high levels. Check a coin price book or other publication once you know the mint location, condition, and year of production. This will give you the book value of the coin, although market conditions could have further influences on the price.  If a coin was produced during a certain time period or to commemorate a specific event, it may have added value. Read up on your coin’s history in a price guide or an encyclopedia.  Occasionally, minting errors result in one-of-a-kind coins that are far more valuable than other coins from the same period. Read about your minted coin in a coin price guide or encyclopedia to find out if you should look for any unique markings that will add to its value.	Evaluate the precious metal content by checking an online coin melt calculator. Find out how many similar coins were minted. Evaluate the condition of the coins. Consider the popularity of the series. Note any historical significance. Account for unique design elements.
Examples include SUVs, pickup trucks, and cars.; ,   Contact people in your network to find out if any of them have recommendations regarding sellers. Search the Internet for used vehicles that interest you. Common sites to use included Ebay and Autotrader.com. Visit the websites of and/or call local used vehicle dealers to get listings of their used inventories. ,,,   Ask why it is being sold. Ask how many previous owners there have been. Ask if there are any problems with the vehicle.    Check the ground under the vehicle for spots. These could be a sign of a fluid leak. Check for cosmetic damage, such as dents, scratches, or cracked glass. Make sure the headlights and brake lights work. Make sure each turn signal works. Test the air conditioner, heat, radio and any other systems that you have access to as a driver. Make sure the seats adjust properly. Lift the hood. Pull the dipstick out from the engine and check the oil level. The dipstick should be marked with low and high points, which indicate an acceptable amount of oil. Clean oil should have a golden color. Brown oil is not clean and should be considered a sign of poor engine maintenance. Pull the dipstick from the transmission if it is not sealed. Repeat the same steps as with the oil, except that the fluid should be red.    Make sure the brakes work well. Be sure that the vehicle handles to your liking.    Many sellers now offer these at no charge. Carfax is a service that will provide the history of a vehicle, including reported accidents and a service history. If the vehicle has been in a serious accident or was once in a flood zone, avoid purchasing it.    Kelly Blue Book offers pricing guides for most vehicles. Visit their site at Kbb.com and enter the vehicle's information for specific pricing. If you have reached your highest price, state that it is your final offer. Be willing to walk away if you do not believe the final price is fair.    The mechanic should not be affiliated with the individual or dealership you are purchasing from.    Be wary of any last minute add-ons if you are purchasing it from a dealership. Many of them are unnecessary. Research any add-ons thoroughly before you agree to purchase them.

First, loosen the screws so taking if off would require little to no pressure to the reed, as it is very delicate. Keep it aside; unpacking the full clarinet might require to use the ligature again.; , If played for a long time, the reed would most likely stick on due to the moisture in the reed. Take it off gently and remove excess moisture. Put it in its reed case and put it away.  Most people take the mouthpiece off first. Unlike the rest of the clarinet, do not run a swab through the mouthpiece. Instead, clean it separately about once every one or two weeks. , Sometimes the barrel can get a bit stuck, so carefully grip the clarinet in a way that does not bend the keys when you pull on the barrel. A good method for doing so is to grip the top of the first section with one hand, and to twist the barrel while pulling upwards with the other hand. Usually the barrel collects the most spit out of all the parts of the clarinet, so taking the swab and dabbing out excess water inside of it is usually a good idea.  These can sometimes be hard to remove as well, so like with the barrel, take care not to damage any keys when pulling them apart. A good method for doing this is to grip each joint with one hand, and to twist slightly back and forth while pressing down on the bridge key as you pull them out.  Simply grip the bell with one hand and the lower half of the bottom joint with the other. Carefully pull the bell off.  Put the parts in their proper spots. If you have trouble closing the case, one or more parts have been put in wrong.	Take off the ligature. Carefully remove the reed. Start removing the first piece. Run a swab through the rest of the body of the clarinet once or twice.  , Take off the barrel of the clarinet. Pull the upper and lower joints apart. Take the bell off. Put the parts away.
If the muffler has a hole, it can cause dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide to leak into the cabin of a vehicle. This colorless, odorless gas is a product of the combustion process. Mild exposure to carbon monoxide can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Prolonged carbon monoxide exposure can lead to unconsciousness and death. Many homeowners' associations, cities, restaurants, and apartment complexes have laws against loud noises from defective mufflers. If you have a broken muffler, you may face fines or refusal of service until you get the muffler fixed. A damaged muffler can cause a car trip to be noisy and uncomfortable.; , A broken muffler may cause the car to have a louder sound than before. Thumping or clunking may indicate that something is broken in the exhaust system.   Some mufflers contain baffles to reduce the noise of the exhaust system. These may become broken or loose and cause rattling in a muffler.  Inspect the muffler for any holes and rust. Visible rust on the outside may indicate an even worse problem on the inside of the muffler.   Minor surface rust may be normal if it does not penetrate the metal.  Although condensation in a muffler does occur and some manufacturers include a small drain hole in the muffler therefore, water dripping from several places may indicate that holes have formed from rust.  If the car overheats, it may mean there are problems with your car's exhaust system. If the muffler is damaged or has come apart, this could cause a partial blockage and cause the engine to overheat or lose power.	Know the risks of a defective muffler. Listen to the sound of your vehicle. Use a car jack to raise the car so you can examine the muffler. Look for water dripping from the muffler. Check the temperature of the engine after the car has run a while. Take your car to a mechanic if you suspect your car has a defective muffler.
Figure out what conditions the plants you're growing need to thrive, then choose a suitable area in your yard or on your patio.   Most vertical gardens do well with a lot of sunlight. Pick a spot close to a wall if you want your garden to eventually climb the walls of your house.  If you're using a trellis, a stake or a pole, be sure to bury it deep in the ground so that it doesn't wobble or fall over. Remember that the garden will get heavier as it grows, and it will need a solid foundation that can stand up to wind and rain.   Use a post driver to push your metal or wooden posts deep into the ground.  Taking into account the individual needs of the plants you are using, plant seeds or seedlings in holes spaced around the base of the trellis, pole or other structure you are using. Make sure they aren't too close to each other or the structure so that they'll have room to root and grow.  Make sure they get adequate water and that you fertilize them, protect them with mulch, and take other measures they need to grow healthy and strong.  When the seedlings get a few inches high, it's time to train them to wrap around the structure you erected. Gently wrap the stems of the plants around the base of the structure, taking care not to bend or break them. Use ties to hold the stems in place as they grow.   Don't tie the stems too tightly. This prevents them from growing properly and may actually damage the plant. As the stems begin to grow and wind around the structure, continue using ties to train them to grow in the direction you want them to grow. For vines like hops, tie a string to the trellis a few feet above the ground, and stake it to the ground near the plant. Train the plant up the string until it reaches the trellis. If you are using metal or other slick types of materials, run the string all the way to the top so the vines have something to grab onto.	Pick a good spot.A vertical garden, like any other type of garden, needs to be planted in an area with good soil drainage and the right combination of shade and sunlight. Make sure the garden structure is stable. Plant around the base of the structure. Care for the plants according to their needs. Train the plants.
Federal law requires that products labeled as "organic" must pass USDA organic standards, but untrustworthy sellers may attempt to pass off non-organic compost as organic, especially if they are a small seller. To avoid this, look for bags of compost that are marked with the USDA Organic seal. These products will be labeled either "100% organic" or "organic." Products labeled as simply "organic" contain less than 100 percent organic materials but at least 95 percent.; , Even though composts are made from decaying materials, a finished compost should smell decent. It should not smell like garbage or like ammonia. If it does, there is a good chance that the composting process has not been completed and that it will not do your plants sufficient good.  Another simple yet important means of determining a compost's quality is by physically examining it. Compost should appear dark, and when felt with your hands, it should be light and fluffy. The material should also be consistent the entire way through. If you can still determine what the raw materials are simply by looking at it, the composting process is not complete.  If, upon examination, you see non-biodegradable materials littered in the compost like plastic or glass, do not use it. These materials do not offer any nutritional benefit to your plants, and oftentimes, they may have been produced using various chemicals.  For the most part, though, this sludge is also full of pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, industrial waste, and chemicals that disrupt hormones. Compost containing biosolids should generally be avoided.  Avoid composts that only contain one type of organic matter. Instead, gravitate toward composts made from many organic sources, including leaves, grass clippings, food scraps, plant scraps, and manure. The greater the variety, the bigger the range of nutritional benefits.   You should not, however, buy composts made from a variety of wood-based products, like sawdust or bark chips. These composts are not nutritious at all and may contain toxins from the wood.  While you do not want composts crawling with damaging pests like aphids, composts that contain earthworms or other waste-consuming insects can actually be beneficial. By selecting a compost with insects in it, you can be assured that the compost is nutritious enough to support life.	Make sure that it is certified organic. Smell the compost.It may sound odd, but checking the odor is an important part of determining the compost's quality. Examine the compost with your hands. Avoid composts with garbage. Avoid composts laced with bio-solids.Sewage sludge is often marketed as an organic soil amendment because it does contain nitrogen and other nutrients that are beneficial to plants. Look for diversity. Do not write off composts that contain insects.

People prefer to look at your face than what your feet are doing so if you go wrong, smile like you meant to do it and no one will notice.  Give yourself a pat on the back, and if you did slip up then don't dwell on it no one will of noticed.	Learn your stuff: No matter what you are doing you should know what you are doing weeks ahead of the performance, lines should be learnt to the stage where they role of the tongue without much thought, this will prove very useful when you begin to feels nerves, they won't be as bad because you won't be nervous about forgetting them. Stay Calm: There will be a lot of excitement backstage when everyone is getting ready but remember to keep yourself calm. Stay hydrated: with the hot lights, fast pace and physical activity, it is easy to become dehydrated which may give you a head ache and therefore put you off, it can also reduce some of the natural anxiety you will feel before going on stage.  , Eat something: evening performances are normally after meal times, but usually a performer has to be there well before, so it can be easy to forget about food. Warm up well: To warm up, first screw your face up into the biggest frown you can make. Get into character: It's not just about acting the part, it's about feeling the part. Get prepared at the side of the stage: Get to your entrance point well ahead of time and keep quiet. Have fun onstage: If you aren't used to an audience, then don't look at them but remember they are here to see you so they would love to see your face. Smile!, After the show: Congratulations!
There are thousands of species of bromeliads, and different varieties grow best in different levels of sunlight, temperature, and humidity. If you purchased your bromeliad from a nursery, the employees there should be able to tell you the exact genus and which environment to put it in. A gardener, botanist, or bromeliad identification book could also help, especially if you know the region your plant is native to.   Visit an online photo gallery of bromeliads to see if you can narrow yours down to a specific genus. Searching for that genus name should be enough to provide the basic care information you need. If you can get an exact species identification, search online for the name of that species to learn more specific information about temperature, soil, etc. If you can get a genus identification but not a specific species name, which is common, follow the general guidelines on this chart. If multiple boxes are checked in one category, follow whichever one matches the guidelines below, as that should work for the largest number of bromeliad species. If you can't identify your bromeliad at all, follow the advice below for the most common successful care methods. Monitor your plant closely and use the Troubleshooting Guide to alter your care if the plant appears unhealthy.; , Most bromeliads suffer in ordinary soil or potting soil, since it collects too much water and rots the root system. It's better to use specific potting mixes designed for bromeliads, or to create your own to match the plant. Identify your bromeliad's needs using these simple methods:   If your plant is labeled "air bromeliad", "air plant", "tillandsia", "epiphytic", or "non terrestrial", it grows on other plants instead of in soil. These plants are sold attached to a piece of wood, by themselves, or in a pot containing only dry bark or rocks. Skip to the section Caring for Air BromeliadsIf your plant is a "terrestrial" variety, or if it looks similar to a pineapple, grass, or succulent, it requires a mix that can hold a little more moisture than other bromeliad varieties.The soil should still be on the fast-draining side as far as ordinary potting mixes go, so use a variety specially for bromeliads or mix 2 parts ordinary potting mix with 1 part perlite or sand. You can also use a mix designed for cacti and succulents. If your plant's leaves from a central cup or cylinder for holding water, or if the plant has no clear identifying characteristics, use a coarsely packed, well draining potting mix. Purchase one specially made for bromeliads, or mix your own with equal parts pine bark nuggets (or mulch), perlite, and soil-less professional potting mix. The end result should moisten quickly but drain well., If you live in an area with 50–75% humidity and no frost, you should be able to keep your bromeliad outdoors year round. Most bromeliads originated in the tropics and are happiest in daytime temperatures between 75º and 90ºF (24–32ºC).Occasional, brief variations outside these temperatures and cooler nights shouldn't harm your plants.   If you can't find your area's humidity on the weather report, follow these linked instructions to calculate it yourself. If your area's outdoor conditions fit the bill most of the year but not in winter, plant the bromeliad in a buried container. Before the frost hits, dig up the container for an easy move indoors.If you don't know the exact species and maximum size, use a bigger container than you think you need to be on the safe side. If your plant was sold with an identification tag or care guide, it may specify different temperatures that better match the specific species.  A plastic pot will hold moisture for longer periods, which is important in heated or dry homes. If your indoor environment is typically quite humid, use a ceramic pot instead.   Remember to place a high-lipped saucer beneath the pot, or something else that will catch the excess water when it drains.  Almost all varieties of bromeliad are tropical, and thrive in warm but shaded areas. Even if you don't know the name of your species, your plant may contain clues to give you more detailed information:If the plant has thick, gray-green leaves, it grows best in bright, indirect sunlight. Plant it somewhere it will receive light without being directly exposed to the sun's rays, such as indoors near an east-facing window or outdoors in mottled or mild shade. Thin, green leaves should be kept in low indirect sunlight. Plant this somewhere dim, such as beneath a tree that provides significant shading, or indoors near a north-facing window (south-facing if you live in the Southern Hemisphere). Full, direct sunlight should only used on a minority of desert-dwelling species, and most of these are air bromeliads, not terrestrial ones. If you're not certain of your identification, stick with indirect sunlight.  Do not water excessively; bromeliads can handle dry conditions much better than soaked roots. Only water once the top two inches (5 cm) are dry, and drain any excess water.    Never use a metal watering can to water bromeliads. Many varieties cannot handle the trace amounts of metal that enter the water. If planted indoors, it may be a good idea to flush salt buildups from the soil by watering the plant until the water comes through the drainage holes. Only do this if your plant is in quick-draining soil that does not stay soaked for long. Mist the bromeliad daily using a spray bottle filled with water.  Many bromeliads have a cup or cylinder in the center of their leaves, intended for catching rainwater. If one is present, keep it filled with rainwater or distilled water rather than tap water, especially if your tap water is hard.   Every week, empty the tank of water and debris by gently turning the plant over the sink. Replace it with fresh water to reduce the risk of rot. If your pipes, dishes, or sink regularly get crusted with a mineral deposit, usually white, your tap water is "hard" and should not be used for this purpose. Never get water on the surface of a plant during periods of direct or high temperature sun, especially the late morning and early afternoon. The heated water can burn your plant.  Bromeliads are slow growing plants, and cannot make use of fertilizers at the same rate many plants can. Overusing fertilizer can make extra-long, thin leaves without improving useful growth, or diminish the plant's color, so be careful and follow these steps to fertilize properly:Fertilizer should not be used on indoor plants, or during the winter months. Fertilizer works best on grass-like bromeliads or on adult bromeliads you are trying to encourage to bloom. Never apply fertilizer directly to the plant or into the central water tank between the leaves. This can burn the bromeliad. Plants with central water tanks should have their tank emptied and refilled every couple months to reduce rot, but they do lose nutrients this way. Place a small amount of slow-acting, time-release fertilizer around the base of the plant after emptying the tank.  Bromeliads typically only flower once in their lives, then die, but their lifespan may cover several years before this happens. Before it dies, it should produce the buds of new plants called "pups", usually within or under the base of the lowest leaves. Once the pup has had six months to grow, or the mother plant begins to die, cut them off near the base with a sharp, disinfected knife and plant one in its own pot.Disinfect the knife by rubbing the blade thoroughly with rubbing alcohol. This can also be used to remove unsightly dead flowers, or brightly colored flower-supporting structures. Try not to cut too close to the main plant.	Attempt to identify your bromeliad. Learn which type of planting material to use. Look up year round temperature and humidity if planting your bromeliad outdoors. If planting indoors, use a plastic pot unless the area is unusually humid. Place in an area of indirect sunlight. Moisten around the base of plants in soil or potting mix. Fill the tank of the plant with distilled water if it has one. Fertilize only when necessary and do so carefully. Harvest young plants from your bromeliad once the bloom dies.
This petroleum jelly-textured substance is sold at drugstores, and is commonly used by people with colds to help open the sinuses and nostrils.  You can put some of the rub on a tissue well before you plan to fake cry. Place it in a plastic baggie and put it in your pocket or purse so that it's accessible when the moment arrives.  When it's time to cry, pretend that you are overcome with emotion, then use the tissue to apply just a little of the mentholated rub under the bottom lash line of each eye. Its proximity to your eyeballs will cause your eyes to begin producing tears. Be very careful not to get any of the rub inside your eyes, as this will cause pain and a burning sensation.   Keep the tissue near your eyes until they begin producing tears. It may take 30 seconds or so. In the meantime, make crying noises. The mentholated rub has the added benefit of looking shiny on your skin, so even if you don't produce a lot of tears, your eyes will look wet.	Get some methylated chapstick or chest rub. Put some rub on a clean tissue. Rub a dab under each eye. Take a number of deep breaths to also make it sound like you're crying.
Frost can be a major danger for young olive oil trees. In general, opt to plant in spring after temperatures have been consistently warm and there has been no recent frost. Most people plant trees during April or May, but adjust for your region.The more time trees have to grow before winter, the better. Plant your trees as soon as possible after the last expected frost date of the season.  Purchase potted olive trees online or at a local greenhouse. Seeds on their own are fragile and difficult to cultivate. You should plant trees that are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) high and whose branches start at three feet., Measure the trees pot, including its circumference and height. Dig a hole about that deep and wide. You do not have to get the hole the exact number of inches and measure, but the hole should be roughly the same size so that the tree fits comfortably in the soil., Remove the tree from the container, including all the roots. Cut or untwist any circling roots as best you can, but stay away from the root ball. Cutting into this can damage your plants., Use the previously dug soil and surrounding soil to fill in the rest of the hole. Put an inch of topsoil over the root ball. At this time, things like fertilizer and compost should not be added near your tree. The tree should grow out of the native soil initially., Dip emitters are irrigation systems that keep your olive trees properly hydrated. For the first year, they should be placed right next to each tree trunk. The following year, they should be moved 24 inches away from the trunks. A second emitter should be added, also 24 inches away from the trunk.Installing dip emitter is complicated. While you can purchase them at a hardware store, installation is tricky unless you have extensive gardening experience. It is best to hire professionals to install your emitters. Usually, emitters are hooked up to a water source such as an outside faucet. You then run the tubing across your garden or yard until it gets to the base of your trees. You will then poke holes in the tubing and install a watering device to help irrigate your olive trees., When using dip irrigators, you should water your trees Other mulches can be used instead of coarse straw. Lucerne, soya bean, and pea hay, to name a few, are excellent mulches high in nitrogen and other nutrients to feed the tree.	Plant your trees in the spring. Start with potted trees. Dig a hole about the same size as the tree's planting container. Take the tree out of its container and check the roots. Fill the hole. Install dip emitters near the tree trunk. Water and mulch the area with straw.
You can simply crack the egg in half, but you won't have much space to plant the seeds in. Instead, consider cracking the egg near the upper third with a spoon.Save the egg yolk and white for eating later.   Don't use hardboiled eggs, as the shells would be brittle. If you already cooked the egg, save the water you cooked it in, let it cool, and use it to water your plants instead. Don't use colored or painted eggs (such as Easter eggs). The pigments in paints and markers contain dyes that can harm the delicate seedlings., When rinsing the shell, be sure to run your finger around the inside of the shell to remove any residue.  It is easiest if you do this from the inside.It is not absolutely necessary, but it will help prevent over-watering, which can kill a young plant. , Larger vegetables, such as beans, cucumber, and squash can work, but they will need to be moved outside 1 week after they sprout.Consider easy-to-grow herbs, such as: basil, dill, and parsley. Marigolds are great for starting in eggshells, and they are edible too., The holder can be as simple as an egg carton to as fancy as an egg holder. If you are using an egg carton, consider lining it with plastic first so that it doesn't get soggy from the draining water.  Depending on what type of seed you planted, you might see the seedling emerge in less than a week. When watering the seedlings, consider using a spray bottle instead of a watering can; it will be a lot more gentle on the delicate, young plants.Depending on how dry it is in your home, you may need to water the seeds every day to every few days. Consider rotating the eggshell every few days. This will allow the plants to get equal amounts of sunlight and grow more evenly.You may need to pull out the smaller/weaker seedlings so that each eggshell has one plant growing in it. This will ensure that the young seedlings enough space to grow in., Before you plant the egg in the soil, crush it slightly in your hand—enough to break the shell but not so much that the soil loses its shape. This will break the shell up a little and allow the roots to poke through.Eggshells are biodegradable. As they decompose, they will release nutrients and calcium into the soil, which will help the young plant grow.,	Crack open a raw egg and remove the yolk and white. Clean the shell, inside and out, using warm water, then set it down in the sun the dry. Consider poking a small drainage hole in the bottom of the shell using a pin or thumb tack. Fill the eggshell with damp, seed-starting soil.If you are having trouble getting the soil into the eggshell, roll up a piece of paper into a cone, and use it to funnel the soil into the shell instead.You can also use a small spoon instead.  , Sprinkle 2 to 3 seeds on top and lightly cover them with more soil.Smaller plants, such as flowers and herbs, work best when starting in eggshells. Place the egg in a holder and place it on a sunny windowsill where it won't be disturbed. Water the seeds, and wait for them to grow. Transplant the eggshell outside when the seedling has 1 to 2 sets of true leaves. Finished.
Here are two ways to get the shiny paper you need:   Collect and wash brightly-colored sweet wrappers or gift wrapping paper. You can also lay sheets of tissue paper out over newspaper, and cover completely with clear nail varnish or clear-drying glue. Wait until dry, then repeat until there are two coats on each side of the paper.  Place two or more wrappers on top of each other, as many as you can still easily cut with your scissors. Cut it into thin horizontal strips, leaving the last edge intact so the paper is still in one piece. Rotate 90º and cut into strips in the other direction. You'll end up with tiny squares of glitter confetti. Store in a closed container, or attach to craft projects with glue.  Alternatively, you can stick a few sheets of paper into a hole punch and press down to turn it into small pieces. This method is faster, but tends to waste some paper by tearing it or sending it flying across the room.   You can get special hole punches that cut your paper into hearts, stars, or other shapes.	Collect or make shiny paper. Cut with scissors. Cut shapes with a hole punch.
If you’re reviewing an environmentally-friendly electric car, you should include relevant information about how much C02 is being reduced per trip.   If you’re writing for a car enthusiast magazine, you can probably include more details than if you were writing for a mainstream magazine or newspaper, since the car enthusiast will be more literate about cars than the average person.; , There are many ways to being your review. The tone you adopt in your writing and the path you take when beginning your review is dependent on your audience, your experience with the car, and the outlet you’re writing for. Whatever you do in your first few sentence, make sure you summarize your experience concisely.   Your audience might be receptive to or familiar with the car or manufacturer of a particular vehicle. You might want to start by addressing preconceptions, anxieties, or stereotypes. For instance, you might write, “While the GeoCar has been widely panned by critics and industry insiders, it’s everything a modern driver needs.” You could start with a quote.The quote could be from a famous person or, if it’s very memorable, from someone you know. The quote must be appropriate and relevant to your driving review. For instance, you could write, “Henry Ford wrote that ‘Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.’ Today, his company is still doing it right even as market diversification ensures that far fewer people are looking.” If the driving experience was exceptionally wonderful or terrible, come right out and say so in a powerful way. You might write of a great car, “Only word is needed to describe the new NTX 9100: ‘Wow.’”  , Organizing a review requires identifying the major components or aspects of the car which will be useful for readers and talking about each in turn.The organization of your review depends on the car, how many words you can write, what the audience is looking for, and the editor’s preferences.   Generally, you’ll start with a summary of your experience and end with a final evaluation. The middle parts of the review are highly customizable. A car review might have sections on safety features, style and design, engine specifications, technological innovations, or the car’s ability to drive on rough surfaces.  A common ranking systems assigns a value of one to five stars to the car.You might choose a scale of one through five stars, with five stars being a perfect car. Alternatively, you could rank the car on a 1 through 100 scale, assigning a higher value to a better car.You could also choose to forego a final score and let your writing speak for itself as to your feelings about the car. In addition to an overall final rating, you could provide separate sub-ratings for various aspects of the car like its value, design, and safety. Develop a rubric to rate your car. For instance, perhaps you give three stars in the "Acceleration" category to a car that reaches sixty miles per hour in 12 seconds, four stars to cars that reach that speed in 8-11 seconds, and five stars to cars that reaches that speed in 7 seconds or less.  Be clear about the car you’re reviewing. List the manufacturer, year (assuming its a classic car), model, and price. Sometimes this information is introduced in the body of the review. Other times it is presented at the top of the review under a general heading such as, “Review: 2016 Mazda Miata (MSRP: $50,000)” or some similar layout.Your review might also list the final verdict right at the top in the form of a rating based on the five-star rating system.  How fast does the car accelerate? What are the dimensions of the car? How is the fuel economy? There are also many relevant subjective (opinion-based) details. For instance, how does the car handle? Does it sport a beautiful interior and exterior? Is the steering wheel too big or too small? Use these and other related questions to stay focused when writing your review.   Some details which do not directly pertain to the quality of the car can enhance your writing. The personality of the dealer who provided the car, or the history of the car’s manufacture could be of interest and add personality and depth to your review. Generally, however, you should omit details which are not relevant to the quality of the driving experience. Don’t include your personal itinerary unless using it to indicate that driving on different types of terrain such as dirt roads leads to a new insight about the quality of the vehicle.  You should think about the standard features of a Tesla -- the comfortable, modern design and smooth handling, for instance -- and identify whether or not these hallmarks are present in the new model.   If they are, make note of it. You might write, for instance, “The new model is truly a Tesla thoroughbred.” If the brand’s standard design elements are absent, you should also make note of this. For instance, you could write, “Strangely, the typical features of the Tesla are missing from the new model.”  , The car’s value is not equivalent to its cost. Value refers to how much bang for the buck someone who purchases the car will get. For instance, if the car costs $30,000 but provides far more amenities or is overall a higher quality car than others of a similar price, it has a high value. A car of low value will offer fewer amenities or have a generally lower quality of craftsmanship when compared with others within the same price range.  Suppose you’re reviewing a new car. Your review should touch on unique technology. For instance, does the car have a new, more efficient GPS system? Does it accept ethanol or another alternative fuel? Can it fly? In your review, address the presence of each major technological element and evaluate whether it did its job. Was the new GPS system much better than traditional GPS? Or did you get lost while using it?  , Sum up your experience by writing something along the lines of, “Overall, this car handles great and would be perfect for a suburban parent or young couple. While it’s not for everyone, this vehicle is an affordable alternative to other cars of its class.”  , If you liked the car -- or if you disliked the car -- explain why. An honest review is useful to the reader. Take a few days after driving the car for the first time to think about what works (and what doesn’t work) in the car’s design.   Judging a car is highly subjective. Write what you think of the car using your experience and prior knowledge of cars. There are no right answers when writing your review, but you must use reason when backing up your opinion.  Ethical behavior requires that you do not accept more from a given car manufacturer than is necessary to write a review. For instance, if the company offers to loan you a car, only borrow cars you intend to review, and only borrow them for as long as you need to draft your review.   In some cases it’s okay to accept offers from manufacturers as long as gifts and relationships are fully disclosed.  For instance, do you favor electric cars? Muscle cars? Family or practical cars? Identify the type of car you know the most about and write reviews focused primarily (if not exclusively) on cars within your niche. Use your knowledge of that niche in your review to compare it to other, similar cars of its type.  Before getting behind the wheel of a car you intend to review, ask the manufacturer, dealer, or someone who has already driven that car what it’s like. Does the car have any quirks? Does it shake when taken past a certain speed? Is the engine very loud? Researching these and other pertinent questions will help you prepare to drive the car and guide your evaluation process.  Usually, established writers are offered the opportunity to drive new cars for the purpose of reviewing them.If you’re just starting out as an automobile reviewer, you might have to wait until the car is available for the general market in order to give it a go. Visit the car dealership of your choice to find out if you can take the new car for a test drive.   The dealer might dislike the idea of you driving the car about if you don’t have any real intention of purchasing it. Call ahead of time to explain that you want to write a review of the new car. Ask if the dealer allows car reviewers to drive new cars in order to write a review. Perhaps you could work out a mutually beneficial deal with the car dealership such as advertising the dealership on your blog (directly or indirectly) in order to secure continued access to new cars. If one dealership turns you down, ask another. They all have different rules., A passenger might pick up on things you don’t. Getting the input of another person -- preferably someone who is familiar with cars -- can give you an extra set of eyes and ears on the vehicle you intend to review., Explore the car from top to bottom. In your review, draw attention to whether the car’s features are better, worse, or equal to similar cars. Make note of any irritating qualities like drink holders that are too small, or stereo speakers that fuzz out when the volume gets too loud.  If you’re serious about starting an auto blog, you’ll want to review the latest vehicles. There are many platforms available for starting a blog. Try sites like Tumblr, Squarespace, or WordPress to find a layout and blog style that speaks to you.  Autoweek, Motor Trend, and Hot Rod are just some of the many publications catering to car enthusiasts. Contact the editors at the periodical of your choice to learn how to get your car reviews published.Ask the magazine you’re interested in what kind of reviews they are looking for.  There are a variety of auto enthusiast websites which welcome reader reviews. For instance, you could check the site or forums of Autotrader, Edmunds.com, or CarSurvey.org., Good reviews should be of fifty words or more, have accurate spelling, good grammar, and describe your ownership/driving experience. Use a spellchecker on your word processing program to ensure punctuation and spelling are correct. Avoid capitalization and exclamation marks., By inviting others to critique your review, you keep the conversation going. At the end of your review, allow space for questions and comments. Write something like, “Have you driven this model, too? What did you think of it?” You could also invite readers to write to you directly with follow-up questions at your email address.	Consider your audience.People looking for a family-friendly car won't care about the same details as sports car enthusiasts. Think about how to begin your review. Organize your review. Create a system to evaluate the car based on the relevant criteria. Describe the basics. Include relevant details.Focus on the facts. Compare the car to other cars made by the same manufacturer.For instance, suppose you’re reviewing a new Tesla. Remark upon the car’s value. Describe the particular model’s technical innovations. Make a final verdict.After reviewing the many aspects of the car, weigh in on what you think the final analysis tells you about the car. Be honest in your review.Don’t feel obligated to write a good or bad review based on what others think or believe about the quality of a car. Stay impartial when reviewing.If you are a popular car reviewer, car companies will try to encourage you to write favorably about their vehicles with gifts like paid vacations, car rentals of your choice, and other gifts. Choose your niche.Writing an in-depth, knowledgeable review is easier if you are familiar with other cars in the same class. Research the car before driving it.You need to know what you’re getting into. Take the car for a spin. Bring a friend along for the ride. Familiarize yourself with the car.Pop the trunk, fold down the back seats, crank the stereo, put a drink in the cup holder. Start your own auto blog. Write for an auto magazine. Write a review on an auto enthusiast website. Edit your review carefully. Invite feedback.When you write a review, there will be many people who agree with you and many who disagree with you.
Ideally, pick a spot in your garden with good drainage and plenty of sunlight.   To find a good drainage location, find the spot in your garden that dries out the quickest after a pour of rain. If there is no obvious location, plant your lilies on a slope, and let gravity take care of your drainage. Find a spot that gets sunshine at least half the day. Too long in the shade, and the lilies will reach for the sun, and take on a noticeable lean. A full day's sun is ideal. Lily leaves can be infested with fungal botrytis if the planting location is less than ideal. While botrytis is great for certain types of wine grapes, it reduces the leaf area used for manufacturing the sugars that will result in healthy new bulbs.; , Lily bulbs come ready to plant, and lack a papery covering known as a "tunic" that keeps bulbs from drying out.   The sooner you plant your bulbs after receiving them, the better they will perform. If you cannot plant them immediately, keep them in a cold, dark place (such as your refrigerator—as long as it's kept above freezing). Do this to keep them from sprouting, for once they do, you'll need to plant them. Plant them in the fall or early winter to have them bloom in the spring. You can also plant them in the spring, and they will bloom later in the year. The will bloom "normally" the following spring.  Lilies like the sun, but their bulbs prefer to stay cool during the summer. Digging a hole about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) deep, and keep in mind that deeper is better—not only will the bulbs be protected from potentially hot summers, it will also provide good support for the stems.   You can also plant them in a raised bed: plant them at ground level, then put 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) of soil on top of them. This will also promotes good drainage. Space them properly. If you're planting multiple lilies, give each lily about a 6-inch radius so that they have their own place in the sun. Loosen the dirt at the bottom of the hole, sprinkle a little bone meal into the bottom, then place the lily bulbs inside and cover with dirt. Water immediately. This will ensure that damp soil comes in contact with the roots, encouraging growth.  If you're expecting cold weather, lay a top coating of mulch over the plantings to protect the shoots.   Trumpet lilies are the most vulnerable to frost damage. Make sure you keep your mulch slug-free! They would love to munch on your emerging lily shoots.  When they first push up shoots, add a little well-balanced fertilizer. Lilies are fairly hardy, and don't require a lot of fertilizer. In fact, too much nitrogen can result in weak stems, and in hot, wet climates can also result in bulb rot.   For optimal results, select a fertilizer that aids in potato growing. Fertilize when first sprouting, and again about a month later.  Lilies generally don't need a lot of water, so only water if required.   Asiatic lilies, Trumpets, and Orienpets flourish in hot, dry climates, as long as they have enough water up to flowering time. Orientals need watering during the summer, as they do not blossom until August. Adding mulch in the summer helps keep the bulbs cool, and so lowers the need for additional watering.  During winter months, cover the lily bed with straw or evergreen boughs to protect the bulbs from freezing.  During the flowering season, trim the spent blooms, keeping at least 2/3s of the stem intact to keep your strong and healthy for years to come.	Find the right location. Plant the bulbs when you get them. Dig a hole. Add mulch. Fertilize your lilies. Water your lilies only as needed. Protect from freezing. Keep the lilies trimmed.
You must, at a minimum, learn the major and minor scales. These two scales, played across the guitar, can guide you throw 90% of the songs thrown your way. If a song is in the key of C-major, you have the entire C-major scale at your disposal. The following scale is for A-major, but you simply start it on whatever note you want to put it in the key of this note. Bolded notes are the roots, or the two A notes.   G|-----5----6---7---| D|-----5----6---7---| A|--4--5--------7---| E|------5--------7---|, The minor scale generally has a "darker" or more "moody tone to it. The A-minor scale located below is a good fit for songs in A-minor. Again, bolded notes indicate root notes.   G|--4--5-------7------| D|------5-------7------| A|------5-------7--8--| E|------5-------7--8--|, This handy trick will double the number of notes at your disposal when playing songs, though it is important to note that they still have different feels. To find the notes, take the major scale in the key you're playing, for example, the A major shown above. If you start a minor scale on the second note of the major scale, in this case the 7th fret B, all of these notes will fit in your song as well!   Otherwise put, a song in A-major can use either the A-major scale or the B-minor scale. This relationship holds up and down the fretboard.  For example, you could play just A, E, and D if the chords are A7, E7, and D7. But you could also play some of those 7th notes, which simply mean the 7th note in the associated scale. So, if the guitarist is playing an A7, you can also hit the 7th not in the A-major scale (2nd string, 6th fret) to sound amazing.   If you're struggling with the numbers, just ask the guitarist to show you the chord. All the notes he's playing on his top four strings will match the notes on your four strings., Many bassists can play 10 notes and sound good, but only the best players can play one note and make it sound amazing. Bass is a very physical instrument, and your ability to handle and manipulate the strings is how you wring emotion and power out of every note:    Vibrato: Keeping your finger on the string, shake your hand up and down. You should hear the note "waving" based on how high or far you shake the string.  Bends: With your finger on the fret, use 2-3 fingers to push the string up the neck. You should hear the note's pitch change as you bend the string. You can also pull the string downward, too.  Slides: Play a note and, without taking your hand off the string, slide down to the next note you want to play, fluidly transitioning down.  Hammer-Ons: Instead of plucking a note, slam your finger down on the string at the fret you want, sounding it out with just this hand.  Pull-Offs: When removing your finger from a fret, use your fretting hand to pluck the string instead of coming straight off., If you stick to root notes, their octaves, and the 5th, you can create many interesting, melodic, and moving basslines. The 5th is simply the 5th note in the scale -- even if that particular chord isn't being used. You can slide the 5th note between other roots to effortlessly slid up and down the neck. Check the lick below, played over a simple C, G, D chord progression illustrated below.   G|------------5---------------------------------------------------------------| D|---------5-----5--------------------------5--------------------------------| A|----3--------------0--3--0---2-------5-----5-----------------------------| E|---------------------------------------------------3----------3/10----10--| |-C-Major-|-----------------|-G-Major-|--------------------|-D-Major-|  , The bass is a very low, deep frequency, and you'll notice that it shakes the room when played loud. This is great, except when that shaking sounds out the strings you aren't even playing! To avoid this, bass players must use their whole hand to keep other strings mute, which you can do by simply laying a finger on the string to keep it still:   When you play a note, let your finger come up, resting on the string above it to mute it. Don't pull your hand away from the guitar after plucking. Do the same thing when plucking your thumb downward, resting it on the string below. Use your ring and pinky fingers to mute lower strings, resting them on all strings below the two plucking fingers. Use your thumb to mute higher strings, resting it on strings above the ones you're playing., There are endless options available to you, from new scales to modes and melodic tricks, that only come from time spent learning music theory. Start with the basics, like the circle of fifths, before moving on to scale composition and more fun tricks and tips.   At the very least, learn how to form the pentatonic scales, which are simplified versions of your major and minor scales.	Learn the major scale to greatly increase your note range when playing. Master the minor scale for a slightly more moody set of notes. Learn how the major and minor scales are combined to play even further down the neck. Play the other notes of chords instead of just the roots. Use accenting techniques to make each note stand out. Prioritize the 5th note of each scale when making transitions. Mute unneeded strings with your other fingers as you play. Study music theory.
Water should be provided regularly during warmer months. The main growth occurs during spring and summer, and this growth requires sufficient water. However, reduce the watering during autumn and winter; the plant will get plenty from environmental sources.  This plant needs to climb and needs something like a wall, pillar or a wooden trellis. It will also climb along an open fence or railing.  The flowers are large and white, tubular in shape. They are highly fragrant. The flowers open at dusk.  Thin out the dead wood during early spring to allow for vigorous summer growth.	Water well until the plant is established. Provide support. Expect flowers in the summer. Prune.
Lift the sofa forward so the back faces straight up into the air. Many upholstered sofas have a detachable back panel that you can lift to expose the inner frame. Locate and unfasten the velcro strips or snaps that secure the fabric to the frame’s base, then lift up the upholstered panel., Check the frames on each side of the sofa’s seats for the locking levers. At each side of the sofa’s main body, around where the top of the arm and back join, you should see a metal lever pointing in a downward position. If your sofa has a center console, you should see levers on the frames between it and the seats., If your sofa doesn’t have detachable strips of fabric that expose the frame, stick your hands into the rear seams on the sofa’s left and right sides. Check the seams between the center console and seats, if any are present. Feel within the seams for the locking lever pointed in a down position., Use a flat head screwdriver or, in a pinch, your fingertips to loosen and raise each lever and release the seat backs. After unlocking the levers, return the sofa to its normal position and carefully lift the back out of its frame.If your sofa has a pair of seats divided by a center console, lift each individual seat and console back out of its housing.  	Tilt the sofa forward and lift the rear upholstery strip. Locate the rear locking levers. Feel for the locking levers between the rear seams. Lift the locking levers to release the seat backs.
You will be fashioning regular photographs to look like Polaroids, so you can use any digital photographs that you own.   Photographs from the application Instagram are already in a square form and can be printed as is.  You can also print them inexpensively at a kiosk or using an online picture printing service.  You can also cut them down to this size after they are printed.  Look for neodymium magnet paper. This type of magnet may be more expensive than standard magnet craft sheets; however, it can hold up considerably more weight than standard models.  This is approximately the size of a single Polaroid sheet, including white space.  Make sure not to touch the tape too much before application, or it will lose its stickiness.  Press on the photograph to firmly attach it to the magnet sheet. You will leave extra space at the bottom for writing.   If you are worried about aligning the photo correctly onto the magnet paper, practice before you affix the double stick tape. Trace around the top corners with the pencil. Align the corners again once you have tape on the back.  You can use different colored markers for more lively illustrations. Place the magnets on a metallic surface.	Crop your photos so that they are square. Print off the square photographs on your printer, using photo paper. Aim for the photo to be approximately 3 inches by 3 inches (7.6 by 7.6 cm) - approximately the size of a standard Polaroid photo image. Buy magnet sheets at a craft store or online. Cut the magnet sheets into sizes of 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) wide and 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) tall. Place double stick tape on the back of your photo in 2 to 4 places. Place the photograph approximately 1/4 inch from the top and sides of the front of the magnet sheet. Write information about your family members on the bottom of the photo magnet.
The tool must be able to cut through porcelain without spidering or smashing the plate. Recommended tools include a band saw, a wet tile saw, a hammer with nippers, a tile cutter or wheeled nippers.   If you don't want to do the cutting yourself, contact your local hardware or craft store to inquire about professional cutting. They may let bring your plate set in for cutting if you don’t have the right tool.  In this case, the simple half moon shape is used. Place the finished cut plates that will be used as a border in a separate area while cutting the remainder of the plates.   Make sure the plates cannot be disturbed by children or pets (they could break again if moved or dropped).	Use an appropriate tool to make precision cuts. Carefully break or cut each plate into the border shape.
This is the most common time signature in modern music, the one counted out "1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2..." The metronome will count out these beats for you, giving you a perfectly timed track to match up with.          Not all metronomes advertise time signatures like "4/4" or "3/4." Some make you pick the note length. If it asks, set the machine to "quarter notes."; , Metronomes determine their speed in beats per minute, or BPM. While many songs are around 100 BPM or more, you need to focus on getting perfect rhythm across a variety of tempos. Start slow, then move up as you get better.          Some people actually find slower tempos harder to match up to, helping you improve even faster. If you can hold at 70 BPM, then 120 will be much easier.  Just work on one simple strum per beat. This isn't glamorous, but focus on hitting every beat perfectly for 1-2 minutes straight. Really try to get you strumming perfectly matched to the beat.          Once this becomes easier, start upping the speed, still sticking to just one strum per beat.  Once you can strum every beat, it's time to start playing "real" guitar. Pick a couple of chords you are comfortable with -- something simple, like G-C-D -- and start an up-down strumming pattern you can hold comfortably. Up the speed of the metronome, focusing on holding your rhythm even when you have to change chords.  This is a key feature for practice -- the metronome goes silent for a measure, but comes back in right on time. Your job is to come back on time with it. As you get better and better, keep making the intervals between measures longer and longer. Once you can stay on perfect time even when the metronome cuts out you will have the rhythm mastered.  Set the machine to eighth notes, or 3/4 time. Get really crazy and try out a song in 7/4, or drop the BPM so low you really need to focus on each well-spaced beat. Metronome practice doesn't have to be boring if you're willing to challenge yourself.          Again, never just screw around or play halfheartedly, making mistakes without corrections. You need to actually work on staying with the metronome to gain anything from these exercises.	Set the rhythm of the metronome to 4/4 time. Set your metronome's tempo to a comfortable, easy pace to begin -- around 70 beats per minute. Evenly strum the guitar to the beat, hitting just one strum per beat. Try out a more complicated strumming pattern to keep improving. Set the metronome to cut out every other measure, forcing you to stay on time without a guide. Try different tempos and time signatures each time you practice.

Before you can craft a defense, you need to remember what you told the officer when you were pulled over. If you in any way admitted that you were speeding, then it will be very difficult for you to dispute the speeding ticket.   You can admit that you were speeding in various ways. For example, the officer may have asked if you were speeding. If you said “Yes,” then you will have a hard time getting out from under that admission. The officer also may have asked you how fast you were going. If you gave a number that was over the speed limit, then you have effectively admitted that you were speeding. If you don’t remember what you said, then wait until you get a copy of the officer’s notes. The officer may have made a notation that you admitted that you were speeding.; , You need to know how the officer measured your speed. The most common methods of gauging speed are “pacing,” radar, laser, and VASCAR (Visual Average Speed Computer and Recorder). Each are vulnerable to different criticisms:   Pacing. Here, the officer follows behind you for a length of time and then looks down at his own odometer to measure your speed. You can attempt to discredit this speed reading by pointing out the officer was too far back to adequately follow you at a consistent speed. You could also argue that hills, curves, and traffic lights prevented the officer from following you for a sufficient length of time to get an accurate reading.Radar. Radar technology employs radio waves. These waves reflect off a car and then are picked up by a receiver. You can challenge a radar reading in a few ways. For example, radio waves can hit more than one car, so you can argue that it hit a car that was closely following you. Also, you could argue that the radar’s calibration was off. Furthermore, you could argue that rain, wind, and storm clouds sent back erroneous speed readings.Laser. Laser technology sends 40 beams of light over the course of a second toward the vehicle. The rate at which the light reflects back is then translated into a reading of the car’s speed. One weakness with laser technology is that all of the beams need to hit the same spot on the car. Also, like radar, light beams could reflect off other cars. Accordingly, you could argue that the officer didn’t know how to properly use the laser, or that the officer actually picked up a different car’s speed.VASCAR technology. With this technology, the officer measures the distance between two points (say, for example, a telephone pole and a mailbox). Then, the officer uses a stopwatch to measure the amount of time it takes cars to pass between the points. The time will then be mathematically calculated to produce a miles-per-hour reading. You can challenge a VASCAR measurement by pointing to possible human error—specifically, the officer didn’t start and stop the stopwatch accurately. Also, you could argue the officer did not accurately perceive when you crossed one of the markers., You should definitely read California’s traffic laws before going into court. The laws are available here, at the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles website.  If you had someone in the car with you when you were pulled over, then that person could testify as to what speed you were going. You should contact these people and ask them if they are willing to testify as to how fast you were driving.You may also want to get a written affidavit from them. An affidavit is a statement signed under oath in front of a notary public. If you need to compel a witness to attend trial, then you should ask the court clerk to issue subpoenas. These should be issued free of charge., You have the right to request the police officer’s notes.You can do this by filing a “Request for Discovery.” In your request you should cast a wide net and seek as much information as possible. For example, you can ask for the officer’s notes in addition to instruction manuals for how to operate any laser or radar technology. You may also want to know when the officer last had training operating the technology.   The discovery request should be mailed to the police agency that ticketed you as well as the local prosecuting attorney.A sample discovery request is available at Nolo’s website here. Revise it to suit your particular situation. If you do not hear back in three weeks, then you should call the court clerk’s office and ask about scheduling a hearing where you can present a “Motion to Compel Discovery.” At the hearing, you should show the judge a copy of the written request sent to the police department., Pictures might help your case. For example, if you were pulled over for speeding on a stretch of highway that had many twist and turns, then you could argue that it would be impossible for a car to go as fast as the officer claimed.   You could also photograph the area where the officer was hiding and measuring speed. If the officer’s view was obstructed, then you could raise this issue as part of your defense.Take pictures of any possible obstruction. Try to take pictures at the same time of day (and in similar weather conditions) as when you were stopped.  At a court trial, you will be able to present evidence and question the police officer. If you think that you can rattle a police officer, then a court trial might work best for you.   Be mindful, however, that police officers are served with subpoenas to come into court and defend the ticket. Accordingly, you might want to seek a Trial by Declaration, since the odds are greater that the officer will not respond in writing and your case will be dismissed.  You must pay the fine before reserving a court date for trial. California law requires that you pay ahead of time; if you win, then the money will be refunded. Contact the Superior Court for the county where the ticket was issued to find out acceptable payment methods.   In some counties you can pay online. Online payment is limited to tickets received in El Dorado, Mono, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz counties.The e-pay system is accessible here. In other counties, you can send a check or money order (payable to the Superior Court) to the court clerk. In the letter, ask for a trial date.You can also have an in-person arraignment. To schedule one, visit the court clerk. If you choose this option, then you won’t have to pay the fine ahead of time., Arrive at the court early with your witnesses or any evidence. If you are late, then the trial will proceed without you.Make sure that you have written down what evidence you want to submit to the court and the order in which you want to introduce it. You should probably start by setting the scene: where you were pulled over, what the conditions were like, and how fast you were driving. Then move onto focusing on the weaknesses in the state’s evidence that you were speeding.   To make the best impression, you should dress professionally.Try to wear your “Sunday best” and avoid shorts, sandals, or loud jewelry. Always address the Judge as “Your Honor” and stand when speaking. If you are asked a question, then answer directly., You will need to present evidence in order to raise reasonable doubt that you were actually speeding. A judge will be most impressed with evidence other than your own memories of the event. If you have photographs or witnesses, then use them.   One strong piece of evidence is to read the operator’s manual for whatever form of technology was used to catch you. Operator’s manuals often point out the weaknesses or limitations with their technology. For example, the manual for a radar gun might state that it is best not to use the gun on multi-lane highways. If you were pulled over on a multi-lane highway, then you can use this evidence to cast doubt on the accuracy of the speed reading.Read the operator’s manual for the technology that was used and try to find a limitation that you can use.  You have a Constitutional right not to testify, which applies to disputes over speeding tickets.You should think carefully about whether or not you want to testify. Some considerations include:   How comfortable you are speaking under pressure.How strong your evidence is. If you can create reasonable doubt in the judge’s mind, then you might not want to testify and potentially give something away. Whether you are the only source of evidence. If you do not have a witness, then you might need to testify. For example, only you can establish that any photographs you took were taken at a certain location. Also, if you are arguing that you had to speed out of necessity, then only you can supply the reason that created the necessity.  You should draw together all of your evidence in order to convince the judge that there is a reasonable doubt that you were actually speeding. Make sure to point out all of the evidence that supports you.   Also try to poke holes in the state’s evidence. For example, you can cast doubt on the officer’s recollection by pointing out inconsistencies in his testimony. You also can argue that he was not in a position to accurately observe you.  If you lose your case in a trial by declaration, you can request a new trial, this time in person.In effect, you are getting two chances to beat the ticket: the first change in a trial by declaration and the second in court.   Additionally, officers are not paid any money to defend a ticket by Declaration (though they are paid to show up to court). For this reason, the officer may not respond. If there is no response, then your case will be dismissed., You will need to fill out a “Request for Trial By Written Declaration” form, which is available from the California Courts website here. You can print out the form and type or print the required information, or you can fill in the form online and then save it.   You should also download the “Instructions to Defendant (Trial by Written Declaration),” which is available from the California Courts website here.  The form will ask for basic information, including the citation number and case number (if available). You will also be asked to state what kind of evidence you have to support your case:photographs medical records registration documents inspection certificates diagram car repair receipt insurance documents other  , The form will also require that you draft a statement of facts. If you need more space than that allotted on the form, then you should write on additional sheets and attach them.A compelling statement of facts will rely heavily on evidence apart from your own recollection. For example, you should rely on photographs, witness affidavits, limitations on the technology used to measure speed, and a mechanic’s report on limitations with your car (such as an inability to go above a certain speed). Be sure to describe all of the evidence that you are including with the Request., You will also have to pay the full amount of the fine.Contact the court to ask about acceptable methods of payment.   Also keep a copy of the form for your records.  After the judge has made a decision, you will receive a “Decision and Notice of Decision.” If you lose the trial by declaration, then you can seek a new trial by filing Form TR-220, “Request for New Trial (De Novo).” This form can be downloaded from the California Courts website.   You must file it within 20 days of the postmarked date on the “Decision and Notice of Decision.” You should not delay in completing the form and sending it in.	Remember what you told the police officer. Learn the weaknesses in different technology. Read the traffic laws. Identify witnesses. Request the officer’s notes. Take pictures. Understand the benefits of a court trial. Pay your fine. Attend your trial. Present evidence. Choose whether to testify. Make a closing argument. Understand the benefits of a trial by declaration. Get the request form. Fill out the form. Draft a statement of facts. Submit the form. Seek a new trial, if necessary.
With enough practice and vocal strength, you should be able to shatter a glass from a more comfortable distance. Most normal people, however, will have difficulty sustaining the volume necessary for breaking a glass. Being very close will focus your sound energy and give you the best chance possible of making it break.   To check just how loud you are singing, you might want to download a sound measuring app from the app store on your phone or buy a sound level meter from an online retailer. If you notice that, even at your loudest, you're nowhere close to the 100 - 110 decibel range, you might want to consider using a microphone., Begin singing the resonant tone at a normal speaking volume. Listen carefully to the sound of your voice. Does it sound sharp (above the resonant pitch) or flat (below the resonant pitch)? If so, make slight adjustments to your tone. When you are confident that you are singing the pitch perfectly, slowly increase your singing volume into you are singing as loudly as you can.   If you feel discomfort, pain, or notice a significant change in the quality of your voice, you may be straining your voice by singing too loudly or too long. To prevent permanent damage, you should stop immediately, drink some water. Hold off singing until your voice is back to normal.Vowel sounds will be less obstructed, enabling you to achieve higher volumes. In particular, the "ee" vowel sound has the highest volume rating. The vowel “ay” is also rated very highly for volume. Sustain your note as long as possible while making slight adjustments. Even if you hit the resonant frequency dead-on, you’ll have to hold the pitch perfectly for a few seconds before the glass vibrates enough to shatter. More likely you’ll have to “slide” your voice slightly up and down and make slight adjustments to match the resonant pitch.  Some glasses will have more microscopic imperfections than others. More imperfections in the glass means you’ll have a better chance of causing it to shatter. By rotating between several different glasses, it’s more likely that at least one will have the imperfections you need to break the glass.   You might also want to try glasses of various shape and size. Be sure you check the resonant frequency of each glass with a flick of your nail; each glass will have its own slightly different resonant frequency.  Wear gloves when cleaning up to prevent yourself from getting cuts or scraped by a sharp edge. Then examine the area thoroughly to make sure you've picked up even the smallest fragments. A flashlight can help you spot small slivers.   You may want to avoid using a vacuum cleaner to suck up your glass fragments. Doing so can cause damage to your vacuum. Instead, sweep up as much as possible with a broom, and capture tiny slivers by pressing a piece of bread into the fragments.	Place your mouth close to the glass. Sing the resonant frequency pitch. Attempt shattering different glasses. Dispose of the broken glass carefully when you succeed.
Make sure the fabric is evenly stretched, neither too tight nor too loose. If it's too loose, it will sag and the dye will make puddles. Making it too tight may damage the fabric.; , Wet down the silk with this solution (it will later allow the dye to spread and dry with a soft edge). It also allows more time to paint as it slows down the drying time. This is called the Wet-on-Wet technique.  In this example, red is the primary color and a simple striped pattern is used for the background. Notice how the lines have a soft, fuzzy edge to them.  In general, always start with light shades then move on to darker colors. Since the colors in silk painting are transparent, once you go dark, it's hard to go back to light. If you want white spaces, then you should leave the silk without any color.  You may notice some of the colors separating (shown by the presence of an orange shadow or halo next to the red in this example, even though only various shades of red were used). This happens to some colors especially when working with the Wet-on-Wet technique.  This is called Line Building or Wet-on-Dry technique. These lines will dry with a hard edge and if the application is a bit darker in color, it will also have a dark outline around it. , You can also add salt to the silk as you spray to achieve a more mottled texture, as shown.  The dye that is applied over a previously salted layer will still react with the salt and create neat swirly designs and jagged edges.	Stretch your silk on a frame. Spray the silk with a diluted mix of water and rubbing alcohol (two parts alcohol to one part distilled water). Apply the first layer of dye while the silk is still wet. Add a darker color (such as a darker shade of your primary color) next to add dimension to the design while the silk is still wet. Allow the first layer to dry. Add an even darker shade of your primary color to the dry silk. Add decorative touches such as simple dots.  , Soften harsh lines by spraying on the diluted mix again. Paint additional designs of your choice with the darkest shade of your primary color using the wet-on-dry technique again. Allow the silk to dry thoroughly before putting it on.
For a slim chicken costume, you can stick with one leotard. For a plump chicken, you will need two.; , Wrap two to four white feather boas around the body of one leotard. Start in the center back of the neck and secure the boa to the fabric with safety pins.   Make sure that the boas are wrapped with a few spare inches in each parallel, so that the costume can be filled with batting. Meanwhile, spiral the boas as closely as you can to each other so that you can get full coverage in your costume. For a more durable costume, sew the feather boas to the leotard.  Choose sweater tights or lined tights so that your skin doesn’t show through.  Wrap several layers of white wool batting around your torso to make a plump chicken. Then, pull the feathered leotard over the wool batting., You can also find and wear a novelty chicken hat in place of this homemade model. , Trace around the template with a fabric pen. Cut through both layers of red felt around the template.  Sew the perimeter of the top edge of the comb together. Turn the shape right side out.  Sew the remaining edge shut, while sewing it onto the white pilot cap. You should attach the chicken comb from the center front to the center back of the cap, like a mohawk.   Once attached, the wool batting will keep the comb stiff. Tuck more into the comb before you finish sewing if it falls to the side.  For a child’s costume, you can find a small pair. For an adult costume, you will need to find extra large rubber gloves.  They should stick straight out.  The end of the sneaker must be flush with the fingers of the glove. Converse or Keds sneakers work well for this costume.  This will prevent tripping when you wear the costume.  Pull the laces through so that you can tie them.  Wrap them around each other like you are wrapping a package. Glue the pieces to each other with super glue.   Allow the gloved shoes to dry overnight. Avoid gluing the rubber to your shoe, so that you can dismantle the costume later on.  Wrap your ankles with an extra piece of white feather boa and tie them securely in the back.,	Find two white leotards with long-sleeved arms. Set one leotard aside. Find bright yellow tights to wear underneath your leotard. Put on the leotard without the feathers before you get dressed up. Find a white pilot cap that ties underneath the chin.Print a template of a chicken comb, such as the one on this site: http://luckyhensrescuenorthwest.weebly.com/fundraising-help.html You can also draw one freehand.   , Fold a one-foot piece of red felt in half. Layer the two pieces of felt with the inside out. Stuff the comb with extra wool batting and pin it to the top of the cap. Find two large yellow rubber gloves. Stuff the fingers of the rubber gloves with wool batting. Slip a sneaker inside each glove. Pull the top of the glove as tight as you can, so the fingers arch up a little. Cut a small slit just over the laces on the sneakers. Gather the extra glove from the bottom, sides and top of the sneaker. Put the rubber glove/shoes on over your yellow tights. Finished.
You can find professional leather cleaners at your local hardware store or even at your shoe cobbler’s. Always use cleaner made specifically for leather on your leather item.You will need to use a dry clean cloth to wipe the leather with the cleaner. Most cleaners can help to remove odors, preserve the color and sheen of the leather, and protect the leather from cracking.  You should always condition leather items after you clean them. Conditioning the leather will help to remove any odors and maintain the color and sheen of the leather. There are several options for conditioning your leather:High quality linseed oil: This is a very effective natural oil for conditioning your leather clothing and other leather items. Avoid using cheap linseed oil, as it will not be very effective. Use a cloth to massage the linseed oil into the leather so the oil is absorbed by the leather. Shoe polish: The oldest method for conditioning leather is also one of the best. Use liquid shoe polish on leather shoes, leather jackets, and leather purses. You can also use canned shoe polish for leather boots and shoes. If you’re cleaning natural leather, buy shoe polish that contains carnauba wax and natural ingredients. Professional leather conditioner: This product can be bought at your local household supply store. Most leather conditioners come as a spray. You spray the conditioner on the surface of the leather and the chemical seeps into the pores of the leather. It then removes odors and helps to bring out the sheen of the leather. Avoid using saddle soap on your leather item. It will require a lot of rinsing and may give the leather a streaky look or a sticky surface., If the odor resists home remedies or an over the counter leather cleaner, it may be time to consider bringing the item to a shoe cobbler to see about getting it professionally cleaned and conditioned. Depending on the leather item and the severity of the odor, you may be able to get the odor removed from the leather for a small fee.	Buy a leather cleaner. Condition the leather item. Consider getting the item professionally cleaned and conditioned.
Let the unripe cherries remain on the tree to ripen and be harvested at a later date. Ripeness is determined by appearance and touch. Gently squeeze the fruit. If ripe, it will be slightly soft and give a little under the pressure. Ripe coffee cherries will also be bright red and glossy. Place cherries in a basket.;	Pick the ripe coffee cherries.
A mechanic’s tachometer or handheld “tach-tool” looks like a multimeter or a volt gauge and can be purchased at most auto parts stores. Ensure you purchase a tachometer and not one of the other tools that look similar.Some tools may have multiple functions. Ensure the tool you purchase includes tachometer among those functions.  Open the hood of the vehicle and connect the black lead coming out of the tachometer to the negative terminal on the battery or any bare metal on the body of the vehicle.Ensure the ground wire is connected firmly and won’t come loose while the engine starts. Be sure the wire won’t get caught by any belts or other moving parts once the engine starts.  The positive lead from the tachometer will be red. It must be connected to the ignition coil to read the signals it sends and translate that into RPMs. If you do not wish to splice the wire for this temporary reading, insert an unfolded paper clip into where the green wire connects to the ignition coil, then clip the lead onto the paper clip.Ensure the lead has a solid, metal on metal connection so it can read the signals coming from the ignition coil.  Turn the dial on the tachometer to the number of cylinders in your engine. Most handheld tachometers have a knob on the front of the device you simply turn until it points at the correct setting.If you are unsure how many cylinders are in your engine, refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance. If your vehicle came equipped with a five, ten or twelve cylinder engine, ensure you purchase a tachometer that can support that.  While holding the tachometer, ask a friend to get into the vehicle and turn the key in the ignition. Once the engine starts, the tachometer will begin displaying the number of RPMs the engine is running at.Some tachometers list single digits that represent thousands of RPMs, others show double digits that represent hundreds of RPMs or three digits that show tens of RPMs. Refer to the package for your tool to know for sure which your tachometer displays. Do not drive the vehicle using this form of tachometer. It is only effective for engine diagnostics and diagnosis.	Purchase a handheld tachometer. Ground the black lead from the tachometer. Run the positive lead to the green wire on the ignition coil. Set the tachometer for the number of cylinders. Start the engine and read the screen on the tachometer.
The 52 white keys on a piano keyboard are called according to the name of each key's associated note. Notes range from A to G ascendingly, so letters increase moving to the right on the keyboard (as in A → B → C) and decease moving to the left (as in C → B → A). Furthermore:Once you reach the end or beginning of the note sequence, it repeats. So when moving to the right up the keyboard, G → A → B, whereas moving to the left yields A → G → F. The 36 black keys on the keyboard represent a half-step difference in tone between white key notes. A sharp (♯) is a half-step up, and a flat (♭) a half-step down.  Most black key notes have two different possible names. For example, the black note between F and G could either be called both F# or G♭.Easily locate the C note on your keyboard by finding the white key immediately to the left of a group of two black keys. The C key closest to the middle of your keyboard should be middle C, which is a central note for most beginner level songs.; , In many songs, you'll find small numbers above or below notes. These numbers indicate the recommended finger you should use to play the note. Very basic songs many have finger notation for each note, while more complex songs may have little finger notation. Each number represents a single finger:   1: represents your thumb 2: represents your index (pointer) finger 3: represents your middle finger 4: represents your ring finger 5: represents your pinky, When first beginning, you may find it a little difficult to play a finger when you read its number. This is common, but by learning finger notation thoroughly, so it is automatic, you'll find playing easier.   Many beginning students find scale drills an effective way of learning proper finger positioning. A scale is an uninterrupted run of notes, usually in 8 note increments, that moves up or down through a musical key. As many basic piano songs have a lot of finger notation to assist beginners, you may want to make use of these resources to practice., Keep your fingers slightly curved but firm so that when you press a key your finger does not bend backwards at all. Your thumb and pinky fingers especially will want to lie flat, but keep these raised as well.Try to keep your arms and shoulders relaxed as you play. This will enable you to use more of your entire body while playing and will help you achieve a better sound from the keyboard. As you press a key, you should feel the weight from your arm transferring down into the key through your fingers. Although you might think that the position of your fingers doesn't affect your playing much, proper form will allow more freedom and nuance in your playing., In music, the staff refers to a set of five horizontal lines on which notes are written. Piano generally has two staffs, one for the treble clef and the other for the bass clef. The top staff normally indicates right hand notes, and the bottom staff left hand notes.   You can find the treble clef by looking to the far left of the staff. It will look similar to an "&" symbol. This clef is usually the upper of the two clefs. Find the bass clef on the left side of the staff. It will look like a backwards "C" followed by a colon ( : ). It is usually the lower of the two clefs. Notes that are especially high or low on the staff in either clef are represented by additional lines added to the staff, called ledger lines. In some cases, like when playing songs with only very high notes, you have two treble clefs or, for low songs, two bass clefs.In these cases, the bottom clef will represent your left hand., Each line and space on the staff represents a single note on the keyboard. However, the way you read these lines and spaces will depend on whether you're in the treble or bass clef.   Each bold letter in the following indicates the ascending order of notes for lines and spaces in the treble clef:Lines: Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge.Spaces: F A C E  Each bold letter in the following indicates the ascending order of notes for lines and spaces in the bass clef:Lines: Good Boys Do Fine Always.Spaces: All Cars Eat Gas., There are 12 major and 12 minor keys in music. The key of your song will be indicated by either sharp (♯) or flat (♭) symbols following the treble and bass clef in the staff, or it may have no symbol. These indicate that certain notes (or no notes) are always naturally played as either sharp or flat notes (black keys) in a song or certain part of a song.   When there are no sharps or flats, the key is C and all natural notes are played on white keys. The relative minor of C major is A. Generally, with each sharp/flat added to the key signature, a previously white key note becomes a black key note.  Major keys: G (one sharp), D (two sharps), A (three), E (four), B (five), F# (six), C# (seven), C♭ (seven flats), G♭ (six flats), D♭ (five), A♭ (four), E♭ (three), B♭ (two), F♭ (one).  Minor keys: E (one sharp), B (two sharps), F# (three), C# (four), G# (five), D# (six), E♭ (six flats), B♭ (five flats), F (four), C (three), G (two), D (one)., You may have noticed that certain notes have special shapes. These tell you how many beats you need to hold that note in a measure. A measure is indicated by a vertical line through the staff. The space between vertical staff lines (or a vertical line and the staff beginning or end) equals a single measure.The following basic note rhythms express the main beats in a measure with numbers, same-beat broken rhythms with X's, and separates beats with plus signs (+).   Sixteenth note: is held for a quarter of a beat (as in 1-x-x-x+2-x-x-x+3-x-x-x+4-x-x-x | 1-x-x-x...) Eighth note (♪): is held for half a beat (as in 1-x+2-x+3-x+4-x | 1-x+2-x...) Quarter note (♩): is held for one beat (as in 1+2+3+4 | 1+2...) Half note: is held for two beats (as in 1-2+3-4 | 1-2 + 3-4...) Whole note: is held for four beats (as in 1-2-3-4 | 1-2-3-4...), The time signature will be represented by a fraction following the clef of each staff. For most beginning level songs, this number will likely be 4/4. The top number indicates how many beats are in each measure, and the bottom number represents which note equals a full beat.   As the top number lets you know beats per measure, each measure in 4/4 time gets four beats (as in 1+2+3+4 | 1+2+3+4...). In 3/4 time, you'll have three beats per measure (as in 1+2+3 | 1+2+3...), and so on. Add a one on top of the bottom number of the time signature to find which note equals a single beat. Normally, this will be 1/4, meaning that a quarter note stands for a whole beat. However:  In cut time (2/2 time), this number is 1/2, so a half note equals a single beat, a whole note two beats, a quarter note half a beat, and so on. In this way, note rhythms can sometimes change., A rest is a pause in music. Much like musical notes, rests also have rhythm markings to help you determine how long or short to hold the rest. Rest rhythms follow the same pattern as notes, so the basic rests also include:   Sixteenth rests: pause for a quarter of a beat Eighth rests: pause for a half of a beat Quarter rests: pause for a beat Half rests: pause for two beats Whole rests: pause for four beats, An "accidental" is another name for sharp (♯), flat (♭), and natural (♮) symbols. When an accidental is written, all notes on that line/space for that measure are also changed, unless the sharp or flat is removed with a natural mark (♮). After a measure, all sharped, flatted, or natural notes return to normal.   Natural marks can also remove the natural sharps or flats of the key you are in. For example, in the key of D major, the notes F and C are always sharped, even without an accidental.Applying a natural to these notes would remove the sharp for a measure.  If you are a true beginner, a beginning level practice book, lesson book series, or primer can provide you with simple songs that help you practice piano basics. These books often include liberal finger notation, which will help you master proper finger position.   You can find basic piano materials at your local music store, book store, or through an online retailer. If you have some music experience, you may want to visit a music store to ask a knowledgeable representative about what book to start with. With enough time and dedication, even beginners can learn moderate to difficult songs. However, be mindful that difficult songs could be too difficult for your level and lead you to getting discouraged., When first learning a song, accidentals (like sharps (♯), flats (♭), and naturals (♮)) can take you by surprise. Highlight these so you don't miss them. Furthermore, you may want to:   Circle or highlight fingering that looks difficult or is unusual. In particular, beginners often struggle with interval jumps (like from C to F). Write in the note names for notes written on ledger lines above or below the staff, as these can also be difficult to read., First, divide the music into manageable sections. This will be different for each person, though you might want to consider tackling your song one measure at a time or in five measure segments. Then:   Play through the right hand. Play slowly, with a steady rhythm, until you have completed the section you are working on. Practice this until you can play the notes smoothly to a steady beat. Repeat your single handed play through with your left hand. Consider using a metronome, set to a slow tempo, to help you keep a steady beat. This can help you get a better feel for rhythm.As your playing improves, increase the speed at which you play. As you increase your speed, you should start to hear the melody of the song come together., After your one handed play through, you may have noticed certain parts of the song give you more difficulty than others. For example, there may be a large interval (like an 8-note jump) or a run of fast notes (like 10 eighth notes in a row), and so on. Isolate and practice these until you can play smoothly and without hesitation.   Switch between hands when practicing so you don't tire out one hand more than the other. If you notice you consistently have trouble with certain parts of music, like with large interval jumps or runs, you may want to drill these. Drills can be found in most practice books or online., Much as you did when starting one hand at a time, start putting your left and right hands together slowly. Make it a goal to play left and right hand notes that fall on the beat together.   As your hands become more familiar with the song and play it more fluidly, increase the speed until you are playing the song at a normal pace. More complex rhythms, like combinations of eighth and sixteenth notes, might take more time to come together. Some basic music books may teach treble and bass clefs one at a time to encourage mastering each hand before putting hands together., Learning new songs will challenge your ability to read music, which will help improve your sight reading ability. Beyond that, the more often you play the more familiar the keyboard will be beneath your fingers, which will lead to better playing.Many songs, especially older ones, have become public domain. This means the song is free for everyone. Search for free public domain sheet music for songs online.  Your piano bench should be positioned so that when sitting on the front half of it your elbows are a little in front of your body. Your arms should be level with or slightly sloping down toward the keys. Your feet should be flat on the floor.For most benches, you'll find that you can adjust the height by turning a knob mechanism or pressing a spring release under or behind the bench., Sit tall and with a slight inward lean to the piano when playing. This might seem unimportant, but your posture at the keyboard can greatly affect the sound you produce. A straight spine will allow you greater stability and poise. It also will enable you to more easily involve your upper body weight when playing, which will help you create a more dynamic sound.Beyond the technical complications created by poor keyboard posture, slouching can also negatively impact your presence when playing., It can be difficult to notice poor posture in yourself. If you are teaching yourself piano, you might want to ask a friend or family member to check your posture from time to time. Make sure you let them know what to look for when it comes to proper piano posture.   If you have a consistent posture problem, you might want to set up a full length mirror to the side of your bench. This way, periodically while playing, you can look over and check your own posture.	Learn the keys on the keyboard. Make sense of finger numbers. Practice finger notation so it is automatic. Position your fingers and hands with proper technique. Identify the staff, bass clef, and treble clef. Read the notes for each clef. Understand the key signature. Recognize the basics of rhythm. Coordinate rhythm with the time signature. Recognize rests. Gain a firm grasp on accidentals. Acquire appropriate music. Look through the music and highlight important features. Play new music one hand at a time. Identify and isolate difficult runs and intervals. Put both hands together. Learn new songs and practice regularly. Adjust the piano bench to suit your height. Sit up straight when playing. Check your posture regularly.
Once you have perfected a couple songs, it’s time to lay down the tracks. After all, you can't sell your music if you don’t have anything recorded, but thanks to advancing technologies, most small towns these days have their own recording studios where musicians can go to record a few tracks or entire albums at relatively low prices.   Check online to see if there are any local recording studios in your town, as the added quality of a semi-professional recording could make all the difference when you're trying to get people to pay for your music. Simply search for “recording studios” and the name of the city where you live, and all the nearest studios will be listed.; , These days, music is sold through different avenues, and each of these requires a different format. For instance, you can sell physical copies of your music on CDs or vinyl at concerts, but you'll need digital versions if you want to sell your music online and through electronic stores.   When you go in to record your tracks, get them pressed onto CDs and onto vinyl if possible, and keep digital versions of everything as well.  There are a multitude of digital music stores out there, and many of them have their own music apps that are used by different mobile devices—such as iTunes for Apple, Google Play for Android devices, Band Camp, and Amazon Music. As an artist, you can sell your music directly through these media.Some of these digital stores make it difficult for individuals to sell their music, and prefer that musicians use third-party networks. To sell music through iTunes, for instance, you need an Apple ID, a Universal Product Code, an International Standard Recording Code, and a U.S. tax ID., These types of networks specialize in partnering with digital music stores and streaming services, and when you sell your music to these affiliates, you're paying for them to get your music sold through the most popular digital avenues. Moreover, these sites will be able to deal with all the red tape involved in selling your music digitally, and will format your music to the various specifications of different stores.Some of the more popular digital distribution networks include:   Ditto Songcast TuneCore Awal  , Just as digital music stores are places where you can sell your own music to people around the world, so too are there digital stores dedicated to selling beats, samples, and instrumental music. Like the digital stores and distribution networks, some of these sites work on a subscription basis while others are pay-per-tune. The most popular music production sales sites include:   Soundgine My Flash Store Beat Stars Firstdub  , You can sell copies of your records to people the same way people buy clothes online. When somebody purchases your album, they also pay shipping and taxes, and then you mail a physical copy of your record to their address. You can do this through your own website if you have one, your Facebook page, or through sites like CDBaby.   CDBaby makes their money by taking a cut of every sale, but they can also convert digital copies of your music into CD formats.  There are many venues where independent artists can sell their own music, and this includes local shows and concerts, coffee shops, art galleries, and markets. Some places, like coffee shops, may ask for a small fee in return for managing your display, while farmer’s markets might require you to pay for a booth.   If you're looking for other venues through which to sell your music, ask around in the local arts and music scene to find businesses that are open to helping out local artists, and approach those businesses and ask if you can set up a display to sell records.  When you want to make a living as a musician, you must reach as many people as possible an promote yourself all the time, because the more fans you have, the more people there are to buy your music. These days, one of the best ways to reach new fans is through social media and having friends, family, and fans share your music with others.Along with having accounts with all the popular social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Myspace, to name a few), you should also update them regularly and share your songs, performances, and videos there.  While social media and digital marketing are important, you still have to get out there and perform all the time. Think outside the box when you're looking for gigs, and try to book yourself at events like weddings, parties, and charity events, along with the traditional concerts, shows, and club performances.   By performing in front of live audiences, you will build a stronger fan following, develop a solid local market, and each show will bring more exposure and new fans., This is a more traditional way of getting your music out there, and it is still important for artists to get airplay. When you send your demo, be sure to address a specific DJ, and try to target a person that tends to play music in your genre. Today, however, musicians aren't limited to local radio stations, so also send a few of your tracks to:College and university stations Web radio stations Satellite radio stations Music bloggers  , Agents are great because it’s their job to help make you more popular and get you paying gigs. Not only that, but if you're looking to get signed, agents are a huge asset because they have connections within the industry.   An agent’s job is to negotiate for you, find and book performances, and arrange show details, among other tasks.Many of the larger labels don’t accept unsolicited demos, so an agent can get your foot in the door., This is only necessary if you want to sign a record deal with an actual label, which isn't strictly necessary these days. But a record label will help take care of promoting your music and selling records, which will take some of the pressure off you.   If you do want to get signed with an existing label, send copies of your best work to producers and executives at the labels you want to work with.Don’t forget about digital record labels and netlabels such as 8Bitpeoples and Monstercat.	Record a few songs. Have your music available in multiple formats. Sell your music through digital apps and music stores. Join a digital distribution network. Sell beats and instrumental music online. Sell physical copies of your music online. Sell your music in person. Promote your music through social media. Perform at every opportunity. Send your music to radio stations. Get an agent. Send your music to a few record labels.
You may need to lay down newsprint to protect surfaces.; , The hole needs to be high up enough so you can fill the vase with water, but still ensure the stability of the vase.   Measure both the vase’s height and width. From those measurements, identify a central spot for the hole and mark it with your permanent marker.	Identify a workspace that will allow you to both drill through the vase and paint the nails. Measure the vase to identify a logical place for the hole.
There are a multitude of oxides available that you can add to concrete. Choose from red, light brown, dark brown, yellow, and black, among other colors.Black is typically used in home driveways and gas stations because it hides oil stains and grime. Brown hues are common in industrial flooring and some homes. Colored concretes are common in concrete masonry units, concrete pavers, and other forms of decorative concrete.; , Gray cement, when combined with a bright oxide, will detract from the brilliance of the color. The concrete that results will be dull in color. Therefore, if you want to create pink, blue, green, yellow, or another pastel or brightly colored concrete, use white cement when mixing your concrete.For an even brighter color, mix your concrete with a white aggregate.  Gray cement works best in concert with oxides that are brown, black, or gray. Gray cement is also best when trying to achieve dull red, burgundy, or earth tones., High-quality oxides will bear a certification on the label confirming that the product meets the standards of the International Organization for Standardization. Only use oxides that bear ISO certification on their labels.	Select your color. Mix bright oxides with white cement. Combine gray cement with darker oxides. Obtain a high-quality oxide.
This table top is a 3'x3' square of 3/4" thick plywood. The legs are 1½" x 1½" square and about 37" long, with triangular braces cut from 1½" x 8"x 12" wooden pieces. The legs are splayed out slightly to give the table strength, and to allow the rotary pendulum to swing without hitting a leg.   Screw and/or glue the braces to the legs first, and then cut their tops together at a slight angle with a table or circular saw.       Adjust the leg lengths to give a table-top height of about 37".       If you want to be able to fit the table through doorways without taking off the legs, you might need slightly shorter legs and pendulums.      ; , Drill 3 holes of 3" diameter through the table surface for the pendulums to hang through. The hole for the rotary pendulum should be centered in a corner about 8" from each side just clear of the leg brace underneath. The other two holes should be aligned near the opposite edges, about 8" from the common side, and 3" from the other. You'll need a special large circular drill bit for this. Alternatively you can first drill a smaller hole, and then cut a wider opening with a jigsaw.    Start the indentation in the metal plate with a small drill bit (such as 1/8") and then continue with a larger bit (such as 1/4"). Be careful not to drill all the way through.       Unless you have a good drill press, it may be easier to position the indentations of the plates on the table after you create the fulcrum blocks with protruding screws below, because it can be harder to accurately position the screws in the blocks later to align with the indentations.  The pendulum shafts are made from 4' long 3/4" diameter wooden dowels. Hardwood blocks, 3/4" x 1½" oak, are used as a fulcrums so the pendulums can rest and rock on the table with minimal friction. For the two lateral pendulums, use 5" long blocks, and for the rotary pendulum, use a 2¼" long block. Drill a 3/4" hole through the center of each block, and screw 1¼" #10 screws through each end. The tips of the screws will rest in the indentations of the metal plates on the table to keep them in place while rocking.  Glue and/or screw them such that the screw tips are 12" from the top end of the dowel and facing downwards. The pendulum should hang down 36" below the top surface of the table with about a 1" clearance from the floor.  The rotary pendulum needs a gimbal mechanism that allows it to swing in any direction. This is made from a large metal washer with 2½" outer and 1" inner diameter. The washer rests on screw tips protruding from under the table, and then the pendulum rests on the washer. Drill pairs of indentations into the washer on each side, off 90 degrees between the sides, to allow rocking on two perpendicular axes.   Here are views of the rotary pendulum gimbal from above and below the table. In the view from below, note the oak blocks (3/4" x 1½" x 5") supporting the two screws (1¾" #10) protruding upwards and diagonally.  Likewise file down the corners of the fulcrum block if necessary so it doesn't hit the table when swinging.  2½ lb lifting weights from a sporting goods store work well, but typically have a 1" interior hole. You can stack several weights and slide them together onto the 3/4" pendulum dowel by using a 5" long 3/4" metal pipe nipple, with a 3/4" to 1" bushing screwed onto the lower end. A 1" steel clamp attached to the dowel fixes the weights from sliding off, and allows easy adjustment of the weight's height to give different swinging frequencies.  Cut about 1" off the top of the rotary pendulum dowel, so it is slightly lower than the other two. Then mount an 11"x11" square of thin 1/8" board to the top of this pendulum, using a small oak block glued to it for support, with a 3/4" hole for the dowel.   Wrap some tape around the top of the dowel to get a tight fit, or just glue it on.       Use two rubber bands, or some clips, to hold the paper in place on the platform.  Connect a 30" long balsa stick to the top of each lateral pendulum using a thin nail. Bend the nail back and forth a little in the balsa to allow the the arm to rotate smoothly and move up and down slightly. The nail hole will slowly loosen further during use.  Note that if you plan to use your harmonograph regularly, such as in a museum setting, a more robust solution for these arms that won't wear as quickly might be necessary.  To make a simple pen-holder, drill a 1/2" hole on the end of one arm, and cut about 4" down the center of the arm to make a clothes-pin like device. Alternatively, just glue a real clothes-pin to the end of one of the arms. Pictures of both versions are shown.  It is convenient to be able to raise and lower the pen gently without disturbing the motion of the pendulums. To do this, insert a 30" pole into a hole near the center of the table, just far enough from the paper platform that it won't be hit by it (about 12" from the rotary pendulum hole). ,	Start by building a sturdy table. Drill holes for the pendulums. Mount two metal plates (about 1¼" x 4") on the sides of the two lateral pendulum holes, and drill a small indentation in the center of each plate. Build the pendulums. Insert a dowel through the 3/4" hole in each fulcrum block. Build the gimbal. File down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed so the pendulum doesn't hit them when it swings. Attach the weights. Create the paper platform. Create the arms. Finally attach the two arms together with a doubled-over rubber band as shown. Fashion a pen holder. Make the pen lifter. Attach an oak block under the table for a deeper hole and better support.  , Tie a string to the balsa arms where they are connected together, lead it through a screw-eye on top of the pole, and back down to a small jam cleat or groove where it can hold the pen in place above the paper until you are ready to lower it.
Keep track of bird sightings in your garden or orchard, either with a formal count or by intuition. Once the number of birds starts to grow, and the fruit shows the first hint of color, it's time to protect the trees.These scare tactics are very effective, but only last a few weeks.Starting too early may leave your trees vulnerable later, once the birds are used to your tactics.; , Pick exactly one of these proven ideas, or another bright object:   Aluminum pie tins Scrunched up sheets of tin foil, coiled into a spring shape Old CDs or DVDs Strips of white cloth Mylar streamers "Scare eye" balloons  , Tie a string about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long to each object.   If using CDs/DVDs, slip a second CD onto the string to sit on top of the first one.This will sit at an angle, reflecting light upward.  Tie the shiny objects onto the trees. Space them about 5 feet (1.5 m) apart, or just enough to be visible from every angle. Five or six should work for a small tree, but a large tree may need many more.  Once birds learn that the objects are harmless, they'll start to eat your cherries again. The repellent tends to work longer for tart cherries or yellow cherries — sometimes a full season, if you're lucky. Birds will spend more effort for sweet red cherries.To protect them, change the repellent every week or two.For instance, put up CDs. When bird activity increases, replace them with foil springs. Replace again with aluminum pie tins, then return to CDs.  Commercial orchards often add scary noisemakers as well. This is more effective than visual repellents alone, but birds still get used to them. When birds start to approach again, replace either the visual repellent or the noisemaker.   If you only have a couple trees, just hang aluminum cans or other clusters of noisy objects. Anything louder may not be worth the annoyance in a home garden. The cheapest commercial devices are handheld noisemakers that fire a small, loud explosive. These require frequent patrols. To save labor, buy a stationary gas cannon or electric distress signal. Place these above the canopy, one for every 5 acres (2000 square meters).	Start when birds begin to show. Choose shiny objects. Tie them onto strings. Hang them up around your tree. Switch to other shiny objects periodically. Add noisemakers if necessary.
There are some plants that give off scents that destructive bugs do not like. One of the most well-known of this type of plant is marigolds. Marigolds are known to keep a variety of pests away, including whiteflies and bad nematodes.If you have a specific problem pest that is hounding your roses, then try planting a repellent plant for that insect close to your roses. For example, if you have spider mites attacking your roses, try planting dill or coriander close by.The scented foliage of some herbs helps repel insects. Herbs, such as lavender, thyme, and sage, are great companion plants for roses.; , While some plants repel bad insects, plants can also be used to attract good insects, such as pollinators. Attract good insects, such as the ladybug and praying mantis, by planting certain plants near your roses. Plants that attract good insects include many beautiful bloomers, such as zinnias and dahlias.Many herbs attract beneficial insects, which will keep rose pests in check. For example, dill and coriander can attract lady bugs., Roses like rich, well-drained soil with lots of organic matter. They also need full sun.If you are going to plant companion plants for roses, they need to do well in these conditions also.   Roses need at least 4 to 6 hours of sun every day and they also need well balanced soil. A pH of 6 to 7 is best.Some plants that enjoy these same conditions include ground covers, such as antennaria and bearberry.There are also many flowers that enjoy these conditions, including: New England aster, red columbine, and false indigo., Even if a plant will keep pests at bay and enjoys the same conditions as your roses, that doesn't mean it will automatically be a great help to your roses. Invasive plants, such as mint and lemon balm, can take over an area and spread uncontrollably.Invasive plants do more damage, and create more work, than they are worth. Be sure to do research about whether plants spread before planting them next to your roses.	Choose repellent plants. Pick plants that attract good insects. Make sure that companion plants thrive in similar conditions. Avoid using invasive plants.
Washitsu (和室) means a Japanese-styled-room(s). This is the traditional way of decorating a Japanese room. Most washitsu have tatami floors, and sliding doors (fusuma), rather than hinged doors.; , This means that the room must remain simple, pure, uncluttered, and clean. To achieve this when preparing your Japanese-style room, stick to the basics, such as:   Using tatami floors Placing a low table in the room, and sitting on a zabuton, or a low chair Creating a tokonoma; an alcove for decorative items Including a kotatsu, which is a particular type of low table that contains a heating element used in the wintertime. This is particularly important, as most Japanese homes do not have central heating.  Stick to the basic colors (it applies to the paint as much as to any item placed in the room). Suitable colors include:   White Tan/light tan Browns Oranges Reds.  Calm colors are essential to ensure simplicity and clarity. Do not paint any color that may come across as vibrant or flashy. Keep it simple and pure.   Look for online and book images that show Japanese style rooms to get an idea of the color schemes used. If using an image engine, search for the term "Japanese bedrooms" to find inspiration and ideas.  Traditional Japanese beds are usually low to the ground. Some are even in or on the ground. Beds are commonly set in the middle of the room, or the middle of the wall.  When you're picking out your blankets, sheets and duvet covers, remember to choose only calming colors. White is the most commonly used, but tans and oranges (and even calm greens) are a nice touch.  Futons (which are on the floor) always have that Japanese-y feel. Be aware that they can be a pain to clean though.  Do you have a closet? You can put a shoji screen over it. This will cover the clutter, keeping it simple, and also looking beautiful.  This is the fun part! Decoration is your way of expressing yourself and using the Japanese style is a beautiful opportunity to find interesting and calming pieces.  Simple plants; whether small or large, thick or thin, a few plants are a traditional part of decorating a Japanese-style room.  Hints of vibrant colors are beautiful and stand out against the calm colors used throughout the room. The only rule is to use these splashes of brighter color wisely. Consider a bright flower, colorful painting, candles, colorful lights (for example, fairy lights), etc.   Remember that black is not a bad color, when used in moderation.  For lighting, consider candles, lanterns, or a lamp. Don't overwhelm the room with these objects though. Decide where you want to put them, and how to get the best light using as few items as possible.  Shoji screens are very common and make a beautiful addition to any room. Put them on your windows or sliding doors, or even have them as a room divider.   Add some Japanese writing (Kanji, hiragana, katakana) for a cute touch.  You can't have both and keep it simple at the same time.  It is, after all, your room. Just because it's minimalist doesn't mean there's no room for any decoration/	Get to know washitsu. Note that washitsu are, by tradition, minimalistic. Paint the walls in the room. Keep the colors muted. Add a bed. Choose suitable bed linen. Use futons. Keep the closet space Japanese style. Add decorative elements to the room. Add some living specimens. Spruce up the minimal coloring here and there. Add lighting. Include a screen or two. Decide on either a desk or dresser in the one room. Don't be afraid to add your own things.
If your municipality does not allow the use of water softening systems, or if you are simply considering other options, buy a salt-free water conditioner, often mistakenly referred to as a water softener. These scale-control devices can reduce scaling in pipes but they are not proven to remove calcium. Salt-free conditioners require much less maintenance than regular water softeners, cost less to run, and often yield a better return on investment., To soften water in your shower directly, buy a water softening shower head online or in hardware stores. These shower heads use replaceable filters to soften water as soon as you install them, and cost very little in comparison to larger water softeners. Read reviews online and be sure to choose a model that comes with a warranty., Aluminum sulfate can cause the minerals in hard water to clump and settle. To prepare soft water to wash with, add one tablespoon (0.5 oz.) of aluminum sulfate to a small bucket of water. Once the minerals have settled to the bottom, skim water off of the top with a small cup or bowl. Use it to wash your face, take a sponge bath, or rinse your hair.	Buy a salt-free water conditioner. Buy a water softening shower head. Treat small amounts of water with aluminum sulfate.
All motorcycle batteries should be checked at least once per month.; , The terminals should be cleaned to prevent corrosion which can cause problems starting the bike.  Cleaning regularly prevents the buildup of dirt and sediments.  Loose connectors can mean the bike will not start or it will start only intermittently. They should also be checked after minor accidents or spills.  Regular maintenance also entails looking out for leaks or checking if they are wet. Sometimes water can get inside the casing and cause the metal connectors to rust. Leakage can indicate problems so it should be dealt with immediately.   , The water level should be checked at least once every other week. Use the minimum and maximum markers etched inside the cells as a guide. Distilled water is recommended simply because it has no impurities in it. It therefore means that batteries do not need to work as hard to perform and they last longer as a result.   , Motorcycle batteries should be charged once per week. Allowing them to be completely exhausted will only shorten their life and impact their performance. While they can be jump-started like car batteries, it is always better to just take care of them so this will be unnecessary.	Visually inspect your battery. Clean the terminals. Check the terminals a minimum of once per month to ensure that connectors are not loose. Inspect your battery for leaks. If using regular motorcycle batteries, the electrolyte cells should be topped up with distilled water. Keep your battery charged.
The leader takes his partner's right hand in his left and places his right hand on her left shoulder blade. The follower should keep her left hand on his right shoulder, with her arm over his.          Or start in the hand-in-hand position. The leader has his palms facing upwards, and the follower takes his hands with her palms down. This allows for more freedom of movement.; , When dancing, you should always keep your spine straight, your chin up and your shoulders back. Your chest should naturally then puff out a bit. Your body should be held with strength at all points.         Always look up. Keep your head held up or tilted to look at your partner. Do not look at your feet or your partner's. Looking at your feet is a dead giveaway that you're nervous and not sure what you're doing. Keep your arms bent at a 90 degree angle from the elbows. In this position, your hands are most easily accessible to your partner. Your arm should rest on horizontal plane.  Most of the movement in the Salsa comes from the hips, so you will want to keep your hips loose. Don't be afraid to sway your hips. Even if you're just moving your foot, know that a slight hip movement goes along with it. If you move your right foot out, your right hip juts out a bit, too.  You'll want music that lies somewhere between 160-220 beats per minute.Before you start a song, make sure that you can keep up with the speed and identify the beats for your steps.          Count as you listen to the song. If you count out the beats in the music, you will be able to find the Salsa beat and identify which steps go with which beat. If you can't keep count while you're listening to the song, it's best to choose a different one.  4/4 time is counted in 8-counts. You'll be doing one standard Salsa step in 8 beats.	Start in the closed dance position. Have good posture. Move your hips. Choose a salsa song that has a 4/4 beat (four beats to the bar) and a fast tempo.
Go to the websites of airlines that appeal to you and find their “careers” page. Make a list of all the jobs that appeal to you, and figure out whether you meet their requirements before proceeding.   Some cities host flight attendant “open houses” to give potential flight attendants the chance to learn more about the career and meet employers. Do an online search to find out if there’s an open house coming up near you.  Most airlines will require that you submit an application with your basic information, a resume, and sometimes a cover letter. Make sure your application materials are clear and well-written, and stress your customer service experience.   It may be a matter of days or as long as several weeks before you receive a telephone call or an email from the airlines to whom you have submitted an application. Most major airlines have only one city in the United States where they conduct interviews, so you may have to travel to your interviews. Know what makes each airline unique, and be prepared to discuss the qualities that make you right for this particular airline during your interview.  Airlines are quite selective when it comes to hiring flight attendants; the right candidates must have a special mix of cool-headedness, endurance and the ability to provide excellent customer service. Show that you’re personable, responsible, and that you care about people’s safety and comfort. Be personable and don't forget to smile. Know that many airlines conduct the first interview via video submission. Many interviews consist of two parts:   In the first part, your customer service skills will be tested with a written examination. If you pass, the second part of the interview will test whether you have good leadership skills. You'll be asked how you would handle different scenarios that could occur while working a shift in the air. For example, what would you do in an emergency if the aircraft started to descent? Or how would you handle a drunk passenger? Use anecdotes to illustrate times when you handled a situation that required acting as a leader while others were anxious and stressed.  If you’re hired for a position, you’ll have to undergo a medical exam before the airline makes it official. Find out what the exam will entail and make sure you’ll be able to pass it.  Every airline has a slightly different system for training flight attendants. You may be required to take an online course as well as do field training on a plane. You'll receive training regarding how to handle an emergency landing and evacuate a plane as well as how to answer customers' questions and operate the drinks cart. Depending on the airline, you may also receive instruction on how to make announcements to passengers. You can take steps to prepare for this by learning your airport codes and understanding the 24 hour clock.   The four- to six-week training period is described by many as being difficult, but rewarding. Learn from your mistakes and always maintain a positive demeanor. Remember that every flight attendant started out as a rookie. You have a lot to learn, and a lot to look forward to. It's essential that you pass the training period in order to move into full-time status as a flight attendant. If you do not pass, your contract will be revoked. You may reapply after six months to a year, depending on the airline policy.	Research airlines to find job openings. Apply to open jobs. Ace your interviews. Pass the medical exam. Excel during the training period.
Sit on the floor with both legs extended straight out in front of you. Lean forward and reach for your toes with your arms outstretched all the way.   Stretch only until you feel a small burn in your leg muscles, and then hold it for 30 seconds. If you are new to stretching, start slowly; take your time. Do this stretch every day.; , Kneel with both knees on the ground, but don't sit back. Extend your right leg forward until it is completely straight in front of you, with your heel on the ground. Lean down and place your fingers on the floor to either side of you. If this burns, hold this position. If not, scoot your heel forward until it does, and then hold. Repeat with the other leg.   Perform this stretch every day until your legs are both flat on the floor and you are sitting comfortably. But please do not push yourself while doing the splits, as you may injure yourself. Allow yourself several weeks to reach a split. Go slowly and carefully to avoid a pulled muscle.  Go into a right split with your right leg forward and your left leg back. Place one pillow beneath your right foot. Once the burn fades away, place a second pillow underneath it and hold. Remove both pillows and repeat for your back foot. Switch legs and repeat.  Lying on your back, bring your knees upward so that your feet rest flat on the floor. Make sure to keep your stomach tight whilst straightening your right leg so that it points upward. Breathe out as you use your left leg to push your hips upward until your body is straight. Inhale as you lower your hips almost to the floor, and breathe in again as you push up. Repeat this in repetition 30 times.If you can't manage 30 reps, set a smaller number and gradually build up over several days.  Begin on all fours, keeping your hands centered under your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. Tighten your stomach as you breathe in and bring your right knee to your chest. Breathe out, point your right toe, and push your right leg out behind you and as far up into the air as you can whilst also bringing your chest upward.   Be sure you're using your glutes to achieve leg height. Do 30 reps and switch legs.  Start by jogging for around 15 paces, and then each time you take a stride, turn it into a leap. Focus on exploding of the ground as immediately and as far as possible on each jump. This is called bounding.Bound for around 30 yards (27.4 m), jog again, and then bound again. Three rounds of bounding is ideal.  If you are working from a specific combination or choreography, are you doing a right split jump or a left split jump? If not, try a right split jump just to start with.  For our right split jump, this means your right leg is supporting you, foot flat on the floor and toe pointed outward. Your left leg is extended in front, straight, with your pointed toe touching the floor.  Shift your weight onto your left leg keeping your knee bent outward, essentially forming a plie, while you shift your right foot along the floor to the front.  Point your right toe as you bring your fully extended leg upward.  Use your left leg to push as forcefully as possible off the floor. Push through your leg, the ball of your foot, and then even your toe to gain as much power as possible.  While you are in the air, fully stretch your legs out in front and back, attempting to achieve your hard-earned split in mid-air.  Bring your front (in this case, right) foot downward and land with your knee bent to absorb the shock. Keep your back leg and arms extended outward as they were in the jump.  Bring your arms down as you pull your back leg down and through to point out in front as it did in the beginning.	Start stretching. Stretch for the split. Push your flexibility further. Strengthen your body. Strengthen your glutes. Strengthen your jumping muscles. Decide which split you are doing. Prepare your legs. Step forward. Raise your right leg. Jump. Extend your legs. Land.

Forklifts vary in brand, size and purpose. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.   How much weight does the forklift need to lift? Always purchase a lift that can handle at least the heaviest load, even if you rarely lift that much weight. What is the maximum height the load will be lifted? Forklifts vary in how high they can lift a load. Again, think in terms of at least your maximum height. Will the forklift be used outdoors or indoors? Engine forklifts are typically used outdoors and electric lifts are used indoors.; , Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements.   Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Forklift rental and lease companies may have used forklifts for sale. Local businesses that recently purchased a new forklift may be selling the used model directly.    Ask the seller how many hours the lift has been used. Most machines have an hour counter that keeps track of its running time. The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts. Look over the maintenance records. Has the forklift been maintained and serviced on a regular schedule? Check to see if any parts have been replaced during the service. Inquire about the factory warranty. If it is expired or soon will expire, it may be possible to pay a fee to extend the warranty. Equipment with a warranty is your safest purchase. Have a qualified forklift operator view and test-drive the lift. Ask a mechanic to check the forklift for potential problems that you have identified or might have overlooked. Add the cost of needed repairs into the selling price when making comparisons.	Determine what type of forklift you need. Contact used forklift dealers and other possible sellers. Visit sellers and compare potential used lifts. Make the purchase once you are satisfied that you have found a used forklift in good operating condition.
When it is safe to do so, then:; , Explain to them that you've shot at an intruder out of fear for your life. Tell them that you have a gun.    If it is safe to do so, check the condition of the intruder and report this all to the operator. How badly is he wounded? Where was he hit? Is he dead or just wounded?        , Do not clean, wipe down or service the weapon. The officers that respond to your call may want to retrieve the weapon for evidence. The worst thing you can do is approach the police holding a gun. When the police arrive, follow their exact instructions. They will first try to determine if there is still a threat and they will attempt to neutralize it. They may ask you to surrender, lay on the ground or handcuff you as a precaution. Just follow their directions and do what they say. Tell them you you fired your gun out of fear for your life. Do NOT provide any additional details, just say "I shot out of fear for my life." Once you calm down and tell the story to your attorney, then and ONLY then do you want to give the police details.  (disturbing them may destroy/contaminate the evidence)  , Do not be alarmed or surprised if you are. Speak to an attorney before speaking to the police.	Ensure that the area is clear from other intruders or threats. Contact emergency services which is usually 911 and ask for the police. Only when you're sure you are alone and safe unload the weapon and put the gun away in a secure place. If requested to do so by the police, avoid the areas of the house that may contain evidence to allow the police to get a clear picture of what happened and how the intruder got into your house. You may be arrested as a precaution.

When gardening indoors, there are two general styles of gardening: container gardening, and hydroponic gardening. Container gardening is just as it sounds - a series of planters/containers that use traditional gardening soil and methods to grow your plants. A hydroponic garden is a special type of indoor garden that uses fertilized water and a non-soil starter for your plants, arranged vertically. Each is a valuable option for different reasons:   Container gardens are a good option for someone who may want to rearrange their plants or eventually move them outdoors. Container gardens can grow any type of plant, in any size. Hydroponic gardens are a good option for someone who is looking to produce a lot of plants in a small amount of space. Typically, hydroponic gardens are used for growing vegetables.; , Creating a successful indoor garden relies heavily on selecting a space indoors that will help your plants to grow. Choose an area that has lots of windows and sunlight; typically east and west facing windows are the best. When at all possible, place your garden (container or hydroponic) near a window to allow for more heat and sunlight.          Avoid rooms that have cold temperatures (such as an attic or garage); cold can kill or slow the growth of your plants while heat is typically more universally welcomed by your plants. Avoid choosing an area near an air vent or fan, as these can dry out your plants and cause damage to them.  The biggest reason for planting an indoor garden is the ability to completely control the environment. While this requires more work, it also greatly increases the success of your plants when done properly. There are three general things you’ll be in charge of controlling: air temperature, water frequency, and soil condition. These will vary slightly depending on the system of garden that you are using and the plants you decide to grow, but there are a few helpful tools to make controlling the environment easier.   Try soil heat mats. In general, most plants thrive in soil temperatures between 75–85 °F (24–29 °C). You probably don’t want to have your house heat on that high, especially in the winter. To remedy this, you can purchase electric mats made for heating pots from the bottom, regulating the temperature of the soil. Get a drip system. Watering regularly can be a difficult habit to master; rather than setting reminders for yourself daily, try getting a drip system. This works with a series of small tubes supplied to each plant, and a timer that turns the water on/off for a certain period each day. Choose a lighting system. Although windows let in a little sunlight, you’ll primarily be in charge of giving your plants light through artificial means. Fluorescent light tubes are typically considered the best choice because they are cost effective and give good results. Otherwise, you can buy a specialty heat-lamp for growing indoor plants., Just like a garden outside, there is a huge variety of plants you can grow indoors including vegetables, berries, herbs, flowers, and decorative greens. Before you head to the nursery and start picking out random attractive plants, you must determine which plants will work well in your garden. Some plants will flourish indoors while others will struggle. Some popular plants to grow indoors include:          Vegetables such as lettuce, beans, peas, and mushrooms, and fruits like strawberries.Herbs: basil, bay, chives, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, tarragon, and thyme.Flowers: peace lily, African violet, marigold, begonia, cactus, and succulents., Because you’re growing indoors, you have a wide variety of options for containers to plant in. You can go with traditional pots or containers from a garden supply store, or be unique and use old vases or plastic bottles. You don’t need a large container to start seeds, and if you’re transplanting a plant you’ll need a container twice the size of the root ball. Otherwise, look for a container that has holes in the bottom to allow for drainage, or simply drill holes into any container.   Plastic containers retain moisture the best, but terra cotta pots are typically seen as the most attractive option. Try recycling old coffee cans or 1-liter plastic bottles to use. This way you’ll be green while gardening - a double bonus! You can line the bottom of your container with rocks for added drainage. If you use a wooden container, try to find one made of redwood or cedar, which are particularly rot resistant. Don’t use any container that has been treated with chemicals, as this could kill your plant.  Unfortunately, you can’t just grab a bunch of soil from your garden and use it for planting your containers. Soil from outside often contains diseases and insects that can kill off your plant over time, and is rarely the proper balance of sand/clay for the ideal porous-ness. While you can purchase pre-made potting mix, you’ll save more money and guarantee the quality of your mix by creating your own. To make your own potting mix, you’ll need 1 part coir peat, 1 part vermiculite, and 2 parts compost. These are all available at your local gardening center.          Soak the coir peat brick to rehydrate it; typically these come with directions, so follow the attached instructions on soaking. Mix your coir peat and vermiculite together until well mixed, and then add in the compost. If you’re able, worm castings are an excellent addition to your soil mix; add ½-1 cup of worm castings to your mix prior to planting your containers., If you’re planting a large indoor garden, you’ll need to create a shelving system for your plants. Otherwise, use the aforementioned tips to select a space for your container garden. You’ll also have to set up your control factors: your light, water system, and temperature controls. If you’re using a shelving system, it should be easy to hang fluorescent lights and your drip system to the shelves. Otherwise, work your space until you have all the components adjusted. Heat mats should be placed underneath the locations of your containers.   You can purchase timers for your lights, heat mats, and drip systems so that they are only on during certain times of the day. Keep in mind that certain plants require different amounts of light, and group them appropriately. For example, put all the light-loving plants near each other and the shade-loving plants near each other, and adjust the light output accordingly.  After planting your garden, you’ll need to upkeep it in order to be successful. Make sure that your plants are getting regular amounts of sunlight and water, and that the soil temperature does not drop below 70 °F (21 °C). When your plants become too large, you’ll need to transplant them into larger pots or split them into more plants, either to keep or to give away.          If you notice any plants with brown spots, that are wilting, or are clearly dying, remove them from the rest in case they carry a disease or pest that might spread. You can incorporate compost or fertilizer into the containers every few months to help supply the plants with nutrients. If you have a drip irrigation system, you can dose a liquid fertilizer in the system every few weeks to keep plants going strong. You can set your pots in trays of rocks so that the water that drains out will provide humidity for them as they grow., There are many different ways to set up a hydroponic garden, but they all follow the same theme: a water tank is located on the bottom, and stacks of shelves/plants are placed on top. The fertilized water from the tank is fed to the plants using a pump system, and the water filters down through the plants and excess is drained back into the original water tank. A few variations of this system include:          Creating a small-scale hydroponics system. You don’t need a massive shelving unit and lots of supplies to create a basic system. Instead, you can use cut-off plastic bottles and a sunlit window. Consider making a window system for a tight space.Using one large container instead of many small ones. There are so many variations of hydroponic systems, and one of them includes using a large tub to produce a lot of the same crop, instead of using multiple small containers.  Just like with a container garden, a hydroponic garden will thrive with the most available sunlight. Choose a space near a window; in fact, if you’re using a small garden the window may be the only necessary source of light. Otherwise, you’ll need to find a location with a lot of vertical space for the stacking that is necessary for the system. Try using a shelving unit or organizational bookshelf for your hydroponics system.   Don’t place the shelves directly over or under an air vent/duct. When possible, put your hydroponics system on hard floors rather than carpet to avoid mold and mildew growing.  As with a container garden, virtually any container is appropriate for a hydroponics system so long as it isn’t chemically treated and allows for drainage through the bottom. You’ll need to drill holes into a container that does not have them so that the water can filter out at the bottom. Instead of using potting soil for your containers, though, you’ll be filling your pots with a hydroponic substrate. Then, plant your seeds as per usual and water them heavily to help reduce transplant shock.   Proper substrates for hydroponics include expanded clay, lava rocks, coco coir, and peat moss. Consider the speed of your pump when deciding how many holes to drill. You will need to allow the container to fill with water while the pump is running, and drain in between pump cycles. Install an overflow drain toward the top of your container to avoid flooding.  If you purchased a commercial hydroponics system, you’ll need to follow the package directions for setting it up. If you’re making your own homemade system, you can follow these loose directions for setting up. Put your water tank on the bottom shelf, elevated at least a few inches above the floor. Then, place your plant containers on the shelves above the tank; the container closest to the tank should be nearly covering it completely - there shouldn’t be much distance from the top of the tank to the bottom of the container. Set up your water pump system to deliver water to the plants on the shelves above.   Your fluorescent lights should be hung directly above the plants. You can purchase a special timer to control the water pump so that it runs at specific times. Set your pump on a timer that runs 15 minutes for every hour. This allows the plants to drain so they can get oxygen. Talk to a local hydroponics expert at a nursery for specific advice to your system.  Over time, you’ll need to make sure that your hydroponics system is in good condition so that it keeps running smoothly. Test your water for nutrients weekly, and add nutrients as necessary.Occasionally, you will need to drain all of the water in your hydroponic system and replace it.	Decide on a style of garden.

Do not buy fancy, scented, coloured or flavoured salts; the salt needs to be as pure as possible. Make sure it's iodine-free and lacks preservatives -- if it's anything but salt it could irritate your skin/nasal lining / whatever you're using it for.; , You want to mimic the concentration of salt or tears by creating a normal (the actual term) solution that's 0.9% saline. 1/2 tsp is about right for fine table salt, but not for coarse sea salt, where the volume needed to obtain 2.5 g can be up to twice that of fine salt.For kids, stay on the less-salty side; for adults, a bit saltier is okay. But just a bit!   If you like, some recipes say to add 1/2 a teaspoon or so of baking soda.However, a normal solution doesn't need it. This is for 8 ounces of water. If you're using more water, use more salt.  Zap it in the microwave for a minute or so, set it in your kettle, or otherwise somehow get it to a point where it's hot but not boiling. You will need to run the microwave significantly longer than 1 minute to ensure sterility. Using a covered pyrex bowl works more quickly, but the top may become displaced by buildup of steam if heating is prolonged. Grab a spoon and help it dissolve.   Make sure it's stirred well! If it's cloudy or dirty, throw it out. If you want to be extra careful, use distilled water (or water that has actually reached a boil). This makes sure everything is sterile and hygienic., But make sure not to swallow it! For the record, it's not intended for open wounds, either.   For piercings, do not submerge in water. Cleanse the area only, as the saline solution can leave the surrounding areas quite dry. Speak to a licensed professional for the best way to care for your new piercing. For nail infections or other skin related infections (not open wounds) submerge the appendage in the saline 4 times a day. This method can take days to weeks to work, see a medical professional before it spreads, and if you see a red line traveling up your appendage go to the ER. For a sore throat gargle morning and night, do not ingest the solution, though doing so by mistake will not harm you. If the sore throat persists after 2 days see a doctor.	Purchase either regular table salt or sea salt. Put a 1/2 teaspoon (2.5g) of salt into a cup. Add 8 ounces (1 cup) of hot water and stir well. Depending on your situation either cleanse, submerge or gargle the saline solution.
Since vertical gardens are growing in popularity, home and garden stores increasingly carry a variety of structures suitable for building a vertical garden. Choose from among these options:   Buy simple poles you can set into the ground. Metal poles are better if you have dense or clay soil because they can be driven through hard ground. If your ground is loose, wooden poles will be fine. Stick the poles every few feet along a row of plants. As the plants grow, run a line of garden twine down one side, loop around the far pole, and tie off at the end where you started. Tie the twine to each pole along the way to support plants. Buy a trellis. Trellises are often made of wood. They are built in the shape of a box with a cross-hatched top and sides, allowing vines and plants to weave themselves through the gaps in the wood.; , There's no need to go out of your way to buy a structure if you don't want to spend the money. You probably already have items you can use to grow a vertical garden. Consider the following:   A tree. That's right, you can train a plant to grow around a tree. The best type of tree for this is one with branches that begin more than 6 feet (1.8 m) up the tree. Bamboo poles. Is there a stand of bamboo located near your home? Bamboo provides a sturdy base for a vertical garden, and it's often easy to get it for free. If you don't have bamboo, another strong, tall stick of some kind will do. Your deck. If you have a deck that extends several feet or yards above the ground, you can train plants to grow up the sides. A fence. Most any fence provides suitable structure for a vertical garden - the taller, the better!  , For a completely customized vertical garden structure, build your own out of wood. Building your own structure allows you to create a garden with the right dimensions for your yard. Here's a step-by-step guide for building a 6-foot high garden structure:   Build a 2 foot (0.6 m) square by 11 inch (27.9 cm) high box from redwood, cedar, or pressure-treated 2 x 6s. Screw 8-foot pressure-treated 2 x 2s at the center and one corner in back, and 6-foot 2 x 2s at the other corner and 18 inches (45.7 cm) from the back on both sides. Pre-drill, glue and screw 1 x 2s every 6 inches (15.2 cm), starting at the top of the box. Extend the 1 x 2s at least an inch beyond each 2 x 2 to minimize the danger of splitting. Add platforms by screwing on 3-foot 1 x 2s, then screwing on 1 x 2s laid flat to create a miniature deck. Add one more 6-foot long 2 x 2 in the center at the front, and screw it to the crosspieces. Add a 1 x 4 crosspiece at the top of the two longest 2 x 2s. If you want, you can attach a bird house to the crosspiece. Fill the box with good soil, then plant climbing plants and train them up the lattice. Add other plants in pots and hanging baskets.	Buy a garden structure from a garden store. Use vertical features you already have. Build your own vertical trellis.
If the door is locked with a bolt in addition to a lock in the door knob, you are going to be out of luck, at least when it comes to using a knife to get it open. However, you should be able to open a typical lock if it uses a spring-loaded latch system or has a button lock.In a spring-loaded system, the latch springs out from a latch pocket that is built into the door jamb and keeps the door shut. But if you turn the knob or handle, you should be able to retract the latch. That is, unless it’s locked. To unlock this kind of a door, you should be able to take a butter knife or putty knife and manipulate the latch enough to retract it and open the door. The simplest lock to open, though, is the kind with the push button as the locking mechanism. All you will need to do with such a lock is to manipulate the inside of the lock enough to pop the button back out.; , You may not want to use a very sharp knife or a knife with a very sharp tip to open a door lock. One slip and you could injure yourself with the knife. A simple butter knife or putty knife might work, so considering using that first.   A thin knife with a sharp point may be necessary depending on the size of the keyhole, though. You could use a pocket knife if the lock is very small, such as a bike lock. If the hole in the outside handle is a small circle instead of a slit, you could choose a paperclip or hair clip instead of a knife as it’s safer. If there is a slit on the outside handle, though, a knife should work., Again, you may need a small knife blade to accomplish this. The lock will need to be a pin tumbler lock. Essentially, you will be using the knife as a torque wrench or wiggling it around like a key.Stick the blade into the lock as far as it will go. Put it in the bottom half of the keyhole. Apply pressure, first in one direction, and then in the other direction. Basically, you will want to wiggle the knife around in the keyhole. You may hear a click. If you do, the lock should give a bit. That means you’re in! It can take some time to get the lock open, though., Work it in until you feel the end of the knife bottom out on the door latch. Most people are familiar with how this works. You need to find the spot where the door latches.Pry open the latch by sweeping the end of the knife and moving the latch inward. Take the butter knife, and slide it between the door and the door frame, starting about three inches at the top of the door knob. Slide the knife until you find the door’s bolt. Push the knife in, working it until you slide the bolt out of the door jamb. , This will increase your chances of success with a knife. Put it above the knife blade, while keeping the knife blade in the key hole.   Apply twisting pressure to the lock with the knife blade at the same time. If using a paper clip, hammer the end of the paper clip to flatten it before trying to put it in the door.You want to rake the pick across the keyhole pins. You want to be careful not to break the lock or the knife so you may need to carefully wriggle the knife for a while until you hear a click. Insert the tension wrench into the lock opening’s bottom and turn the lock to the side as if you were unlocking the door with a key. Keep holding the tension wrench and apply pressure. Insert the flattened paperclip above the tension wrench, pushing until you meet resistance. Push up on the pin with the paperclip. , The most common tool used to pick a lock is a tension wrench. If you don’t have a tension wrench, you could use a very small hex key. A flat head screwdriver could also work. You could also try a credit card if you’re trying to get through a lever-type doorknob. Just slide the card into the crack in the door, where the lock is, similar to the process with a knife. Be aware you might ruin the card, though.At the same time, put pressure on the door with your free arm so the latch doesn’t spring back out. You may need to make this motion several times before you can get in the door.	Determine the type of lock, and understand how it works. Obtain a knife to open the door. Put the knife blade in the key hole. Put the knife between the door and the door jamb’s striker plate. Take an unfolded paper clip or hair clip and use it with the knife. Try another tool like a credit card or lock picking kit.
You will likely want to keep the meetings professional, so personal locations like home should be avoided. Conference rooms, whether at an office or in a library, are usually best for a business book club. If you cannot secure a conference room, meeting in a coffee shop or restaurant that has space for large, talkative groups to meet are the next best thing.; , Standard protocol is once a month. Meeting more often may make it difficult for members to keep up on a reading schedule, but meeting less often can make it hard for members to focus and many may lose interest.  You must consider time and date.   Weekdays are generally better than weekends, since many people may feel hesitant about surrendering a portion of their Saturday or Sunday for book club. You should meet in the early evening, around 7:00 PM, to give your members enough time to come home and grab something to eat before going to book club. Meeting too late may make it difficult for them to get a full night’s sleep before getting up in the morning for work, though. Stick with a consistent meeting date. For instance, choosing the first Wednesday or the third Thursday of every month will make it easier for your members to remember the meeting date and schedule around it accordingly.  A standard length is about 60 minutes, but if you and your members are on a tight schedule, you might be able to shorten that to 30 minutes.   Conversely, if you want time to socialize or talk about non-club topics, you may want to schedule an optional 30 minutes for interested members to hang around and socialize after official meeting business is over.  Start with the basics. You don’t need anything too extreme to keep your book club in working condition.   The most important rules are to read the book before each meeting and to actually show up to the meetings. Members who are unable to show up to a meeting should let you know beforehand. Members who plan to come to a meeting should show up on time. Everyone should show respect for one another's opinions. No one should use the business book club as a blatant excuse to pitch his or her business.  The business book club, much like the modern business world, benefits greatly from the use of technology. Ask members for their cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Each member should, at the very least, be able to communicate with one another via e-mail.   You can also consider setting up a blog, forum, or other website for your business book group to use for communication purposes. These extra steps are not necessary, but they can be especially helpful for large or expanding groups.  They don’t need to be anything much. Just about anyone will appreciate a pot of coffee and a box of donuts or a pizza and soft drinks. At the start, the expense will rest on your shoulders. Once your business book club gains momentum, however, you can ask other members if they might also be willing to bring something edible to share.   If your meetings happen in a place that already serves food, like a coffee shop or restaurant, offering your own refreshments is unnecessary.	Figure out where to meet. Decide how often to meet. Choose when to meet. Know how long you expect each meeting to take. Set some ground rules. Keep in touch. Offer refreshments.
Get a 5-gallon (18.92 l) bucket with an accompanying roller screen from the hardware store or online. Screens will come with two hooks that you can use to hang the screen on the lip of your bucket. Hang the screen so that it hangs on the inside of the bucket.Sometimes buckets will come with the roller screen attached.  Carefully fill the bucket halfway with paint and make sure that at least half of the roller screen is out of the bucket., Dip the roller 1/2 in. (1.27 cm) into the paint. Use the roller screen to guide your paint roller as you dip it into the paint. You don't want to dip the roller too deep into the bucket, or you'll get paint on the side of your roller., Once you've saturated the roller with paint, you should roll it up against the roller screen. The paint should be dripping off the roller and back into the bucket as you do this., Continue dipping the roller slightly into the water before rolling it onto your screen. Once your roller is fully saturated, you're ready to paint.	Hang a roller screen in the bucket. Fill your bucket with paint. Dip the roller into the paint. Roll the paint roller against the roller screen. Repeat the steps five or six times.
Dry wall surrounding the inside of the window may get in the way of the process. To do this:   Use a utility knife to "score" the perimeters of the drywall you want to remove. "Scoring" is the using a knife to make shallow cuts without cutting it all the way to allow the dry wall to be removed easier. Use a pry bar or a similar tool to pull off the drywall slowly and carefully, so as not to break drywall that you don't want to remove.; , There is no exact way to do this, as long as you end up with the window and screen out while not destroying the frame or anything else around the window. Some suggestions:   Use a hammer or a drill to take out any nails or screws that are holding the window in place. Sometimes there are little pieces of wood between the window and the wooden studs that hold the window tight. Remove this by pounding out with a hammer or using a pry bar like tool to push them out or using a drill to unscrew them if screwed in.    This will make it loose and easier to pull out.  This is a simple step that can be started by using a hammer or drill to remove nails or screws that hold in the window frame.   Use a pry bar or hammer to "wedge" out the frame.  This will be on the perimeter of the open space in the wall and will most likely be the same color and material as the actual siding itself.   Use hammer to remove nails used to keep it in place. Use pry bar to pull it out carefully without scratching or breaking surrounding vinyl.  You will be able to easily see the separate vinyl pieces by noticing where one piece overlaps the other on the side., Do not cut the vinyl off.  Use a siding removal tool. Extract nails keeping the vinyl pieces in place in order to prepare vinyl pieces to be removed. Use this tool by inserting it where a piece of vinyl overlaps a piece below it and then sliding it across until you reach the end of the piece.  Write down this measurement, as it will be used for the next step., Then, place these pieces of wood in the middle and the two sides of the open space.   If it is difficult to place these in their spots, use a hammer to pound them in as desired.  This depends on the size of the window, but generally, as mentioned in the previous step, nail one to each side of the hole and one directly in the middle.   Nail in horizontally for side pieces and diagonally for middle pieces. A nail gun may make nailing easier and quicker, especially for nailing diagonally.  Cut a sheet of wood accordingly to the measurements so that it will fit.  This will be a sheet of wood at least a half inch thick for strength.  Insert it on the exterior side of the pieces of wood.   Nail or screw in securely to where the pieces of wood are behind the sheet of wood. Make sure the sheet of wood is "flush" against the studs. "Flush" means with no space between the pieces of wood and the sheet of wood.  Then, insert a long, skinny object in the tip and then remove it.  This allows an opening for the caulk to come out of.    Caulk the perimeter of the new exterior wall. Caulk is used to seal spaces between two objects. In this case, the objects are the perimeter of the new exterior wall and the perimeter of the old open space. This prevents any air leakage.  This guarantees that there are no open spaces for air to get out of.  An easy way to do this is using your finger.  A moisture barrier can simply be a thin plastic sheet that covers the area of the new exterior wall. It is needed because it prevents moisture from getting inside.   Cut the thin plastic sheet to appropriate dimensions so that it will cover the entirety of the new exterior wall. Using a staple gun, staple the moisture barrier to the new exterior wall.  If you look at the area you are working on, you will see spaces of different lengths where the vinyl needs to be replaced.   Measure the lengths of the spaces with no vinyl. Cut the new vinyl pieces accordingly. A vinyl cutter works best for this task.  "Zipping" is the term used in siding when the top and bottom of two pieces are connected.   This can only be done using the Siding Removal tool mentioned in Step 5. Once again, use this tool by inserting it where a piece of vinyl overlaps a piece below it and then sliding it across until you reach the end of the piece. This tool removes two pieces that are already "zipped" and also "zips" two pieces together.  All of the vinyl pieces have little holes on the top of them where nails can be inserted.   Use a hammer to insert nail in about every fifth hole, or whatever you may feel necessary. It is best to use roofing nails for this.    If some pieces are not nailed or "zipped", they may become too loose and get damaged.	Take out dry wall surrounding window on the inside of the house. Remove the window and screen. Cut the perimeter of the window frame. Pull out the exterior window frame. Remove the exterior vinyl casing. Identify which pieces of vinyl siding need to be removed. Remove the pieces of vinyl siding from around the window area. Measure the vertical length of the open space using a tape measure. Cut the "2 by 4s" into three pieces equal to the length of the measurement of the previous step. Nail in the pieces of wood. Measure perimeters of the open space. Insert the exterior wall. Cut the tip of a tube of caulk. Place tube of caulk into a caulk gun and squeeze caulk in the desired spaces described below. Smooth out the caulk. Attach the moisture barrier. Cut the new pieces of vinyl. "Zip" the newly cut vinyl pieces to the old vinyl pieces still on the side of the house. Nail in all of the new pieces of vinyl. Inspect all of the new pieces of vinyl to make sure steps 1 - 3 of Part 3 are done for every new piece of vinyl.
When hanging pictures, it can be tempting to do one of two things: choose way too many pictures, or not choose enough. Make a careful selection of the images you want to hang, and group them together by location.   If you’re not choosing pictures that come together in a series, choose a selection of pictures that have a similar color scheme.       The eye is attracted visually to odd numbers, so try to select an odd number of pictures to hang.      ; , There are two general techniques you can use when choosing frames for your pictures: select frames for each image that are all the same, or select a variety of mis-matched frames in a similar color scheme/style. Frames are an important aspect of highlighting the pictures you are hanging, so be sure to choose ones that match both the style of your house and the style of your images.   Try not to use too many large, ornate frames as these can become overwhelming in groups. If you’re using mis-matched frames, use one or two colorful or detailed frames to make your arrangement pop.  When you start to arrange your pictures, it can be difficult to see where you want them without hanging them all up in a test-run. To make this easier, cut parchment paper to be the same size as your picture frames. You can then tape these to the walls in test positions, and rearrange them as you please with little work and no extra holes in the walls.  As it goes, some people have very specific locations in mind for arranging their pictures, whereas others have only a foggy idea of where they might hang their artwork up. Look at all the bare walls in your home, and decide which are begging to be adorned with pictures. The key is filling up enough space to make it look interesting, without adding so much to the walls that they become distracting and disorienting.  The simplest arrangement of pictures is to line them up all in an even row. Determine the height of your pictures, keeping in mind that anything below the average eye level will seem out of place. Don’t space out your images too much, as more than 6-inches between each frame will remove the appearance of a grouping.   This arrangement works best with portrait-arranged photos.  This arrangement works particularly well for an odd, narrow wall or to fill up space next to a tall piece of furniture. Arrange your photos by stacking them on top of each other, with a few inches of space in between each frame. Typically, this arrangement will be most appealing when placed closer to the ceiling than to the floor.   This arrangement works best with landscape-arranged photos.  Best for a small space, you can hang a small group of pictures as if there were a circle around them, giving them shape. If you have a group of three pictures, for instance, you can hang one of the photos on the left, and the other two to the right of it staggered on top of each other.   This works particularly well if you have one picture that is significantly larger than two smaller pictures. This arrangement will only work with an odd number of pictures.  Perfect for over a table or couch pushed against a wall, select a group pictures, preferably in the same sizes, to be hung together in a square or rectangle. Arrange the pictures so that they are evenly spaced in the classic square/rectangle shape.  If you have an even number of pictures greater than 6, you have the opportunity to create a large square/rectangle arrangement. Line up all your frames in even rows/columns to create a symmetrical shape. This looks particularly good with three rows of 3 pictures, to create a large square.  This works best for photos that are all the same size; lay out your pictures so that you have two long, symmetrical rows. You will have created a long rectangular space that is traditional in appearance. This layout is great for a hallway or another long wall, or above a very wide piece of furniture.  The sister style to the aforementioned arrangement, if your pictures are all different sizes, create two staggered rows with them. Find a center line that will be the meeting point for the two rows. For the top row, line up the bottoms of all the pictures so that they are just above the center line. On the bottom row, line up the tops of all the pictures so they are just below the center line.Put the largest pictures in the center of the rows, and have the smallest pictures on the ends.  If you have a very large wall you are trying to fill up, arranging your pictures in a pyramid may be the best option for you. Using either 6 or 10 pictures in the same size and layout, stack them up to create a large triangle on the wall. You can choose to flip the shape upside down so that you have more pictures on the top than on the bottom, if you like. Make sure that there is even spacing between each row of pictures.  The ultimate in picture arranging, you can create a gallery wall by arranging a large number of pictures in an orderly fashion like puzzle pieces, without using rows or columns. Gallery walls are best when using many images of different sizes and formats. To make yours successful, just be sure that there is an equal amount of space between each picture frame so that it gives the appearance of organization to your pictures., Whether you have floating shelves on your wall or a bookcase with spare room, you can arrange pictures on them to add interest. Keep the number of pictures you use to 5 or less and supplement the design with objects (like vases and figurines) or books. Group pictures on the shelves together so that they overlap slightly; for example, stagger two pictures near each other and a third picture on the opposite end of the shelf.  The mantle over your fireplace is a prime picture-arranging location. Try hanging a large, framed image over the mantle, and then adding a few smaller framed pictures to the shelf below it. This will instantly add appeal to the wall and fireplace, and show off some more of your photography or artwork.  Placing pictures on a table, desk, or nightstand can be tricky because it can be easy to overwhelm these spaces. Don’t try to fill up your tabletops with framed pictures, instead choose only 1-3 total (depending on the size of your table) to display standing upright. Stagger/layer these pictures slightly as well, so that the display looks natural rather than a tri-fold poster board presentation.	Choose the pictures you want to arrange. Pick out the perfect frames. Make hanging your photos easier with paper. Find the perfect locations. Create a row of pictures. Hang your pictures in a column. Create a rounded grouping with an odd number of pictures. Hang an even number of pictures in a rectangle. Create a large square. Hang your pictures in even rows. Hang your pictures in staggered rows. Arrange a pyramid of pictures. Create a gallery wall. Arrange your pictures on shelves. Arrange pictures on a mantle. Arrange pictures on a table.
Draw a line onto the area where you want the fake cut, then smudge it with your finger. Add dots around the area and smudge that as well. Repeat several times, until your skin looks like it has been smeared with blood.         Red eyeshadow will work as well.; , Sharpen your red eyeliner pencil. In the center of the smudged area, draw a thin line.  If you want a larger, more gory wound, add a dark brown or dark red line next to the thin, red line. Dab the lines with your finger to smear them together slightly, without wiping away their shape.  This will make the wound glisten, making it look more recent and bloody.	Smear red eyeliner onto your skin. Draw on the wound. Add darker colors (optional). Add clear lip gloss.
Often, having a small garden or even a few potted plants can be a cheap way to get in the veggies you need. Try growing a tomato plant, for instance, or even just a few herbs on your window sill., You can buy pre-made snacks at the store that are a bit healthier than your average chips, such as veggie chips or fruit cups. However, they tend to be expensive, so making your own at home is a more affordable alternative.For example, try making kale chips. Wash and dry kale thoroughly. Chop or tear the leaves into large pieces. Toss them in olive oil, or spray them with cooking spray, and then spread them out on a large baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle salt and pepper on top and any other seasoning you want. Bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius) until crispy (about 15 minutes). You can also make yourself individual cups of fruits and veggies. For instance, cut up oranges, apples, and grapefruit, and toss them with a tiny bit of honey. Spoon them into small reusable containers so you can grab them any time. You can do the same with veggies. Cut them into bite-sized pieces, and put them in reusable bags. Spoon out (homemade) hummus into individual containers to go with them.  Stocks and broths are a great way to start out soups, but buying them in cans or cartons can get expensive. Plus, they're often loaded with extra sodium. Making your own at home results in better quality, and it's cheaper, too.You can even make a stock with your scraps. Save the bits of vegetables you have leftover, such as onion skins, the ends of carrots, and the tops of celery. When you eat a chicken, save the bones and the bits of meat. Freeze them in a bag until you have enough. When you do, throw them in a pot and cover them with water. Boil them (covered on low heat) for six to eight hours or until you have a stock with a flavor you like. Strain it, and your stock is ready. Once you have your stock, you can portion it out in small containers and freeze it.  Lots of foods besides snacks and broths can be made cheaper at home. For instance, if you eat yogurt often, making your own yogurt might be a good option. For bread, consider investing in a bread machine, so you can make your own bread with the push of a button.	Grow what you can. Create your own snacks. Boil up your own stocks and broths. Branch out into making other foods.
Although “slim jims” (specialized metal tools for gaining entry to a locked car) are generally illegal, you can approximate the tool with a stiff metal coat hanger. If you've locked your keys in the car and a store or friend with coat hangers is close at hand, this can save you the hassle and waiting of calling a locksmith or roadside assistance service.  You can leave the hooked top section alone, but unwind it from itself at the “neck” and straighten the rest of the hanger out, giving you a long metal tool with a hooked tip.  Push the end of the hanger in through the soft rubber weather stripping and the bottom of the window. The hanger is now inside the wall of the door.  The latch should be no more than a few inches below the window, near where the interior lock is.  Hook the hanger around the latch and pull it towards the rear of the car. This should unlock any manually locked car door.          If your door has a push-button electric unlocking mechanism, you can also slide the straight end of the hanger down from the top of the window instead, and use it like a finger to poke the button inside.	Jimmy a car door. Unravel and straighten the coat hanger. Lift the weather stripping from the bottom of the driver's-side window. Scrape the hanger around and feel for a latch. Hook and pull the latch.
Choose a smaller area to start your bed head garden, rather than an entire yard. If you go with too large of a space, you might exceed your budget and abilities.Starting small will also help get your neighbors accustomed to your garden’s natural look. Some homeowner associations discourage bed head or natural gardens, and some local ordinances ban or set limits on natural landscaping. If you have any concerns, call your local government office or neighborhood association and ask about applicable codes.; , Keep track of your garden area over the course of the day. Note which areas receive the most sun and which remain shaded, and choose plants that are appropriate for your site conditions.If a patch of your garden receives at least six hours of sun, go with plants that do best in full sunlight. Choose plants that thrive in partial sun or shade for areas that receive less than six hours of sunlight. To fully understand your garden’s light conditions, it’s best to make observations over the course of the year. Light conditions will vary as the sun’s position changes from season to season.  Visit a local nursery or home improvement store and look for plants that are native to your location. Since they’re adapted to your climate, native species will require less watering and maintenance. Call your state or local government’s natural resource department or a nearby nature center for help finding a reputable nursery that offers native plants.Plants will be marked full sun, partial sun, or shade to help you make appropriate choices for your light conditions. You should also go with various heights to add aesthetic interest. For example, you could choose Foxgloves, a mid-height wildflower native across Europe for color.For groundcover, you could go with a locally native fern or ivy. Finally, you could add height with a tall grass, shrub, or tree, like Paul’s Scarlet, which is a shrub or small tree native through continental Europe., The number of plants you’ll need to purchase depends on your garden’s size and your coverage expectations. If you want immediate coverage, you can purchase more seedlings and plant them a few inches away from each other. To reduce your cost, you can wait a season or two for full coverage and plant your seedlings ten inches apart.  A short fence, edge of low plants, or garden divider can all serve to frame your bed head garden. If you maintain a lawn, you can mow and edge it around your garden area. For a more natural look, use the borders to create gentle curves around your planting area instead of framing it with straight lines., Consider using a hardscaped walkway if your planting area is larger and you need a pathway through it. A path will help prevent anyone passing through the space from picking up ticks that might be hiding in taller plants.Use natural materials for your walkway, like natural stone, wood steps, or bark mulch.When you clear out the planting area, designate a space for the path. Use a rake to spread mulch in a two inch layer, or position wooden or stone steps to create a walkway.  Before you start planting, think about testing your soil to find out its pH and nutrient levels. You can use a do-it-yourself kit available at a home improvement store or nursery to find out the pH and get a rough idea of nutrient levels. A DIY will likely suit your needs well, but for a more thorough analysis, you can send a soil sample to a nearby garden center or soil-testing lab.Testing your soil will let you know if you need to make your soil more or less acidic and if you need to add nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus.  Use a grub hoe to scrape away weeds and other undesirable plants from the garden. Work around any existing plants you want to incorporate into your garden, and take care not to disturb their root systems. Compost or bag and discard the plant matter you’ve scraped away., An organic material like compost or peat moss will help you improve your soil’s fertility and drainage. Add one to two inches to cover the garden. Your soil analysis will help you determine which other amendments to add.For example, if you need to add acidity, sprinkle a layer of used coffee grounds over your garden. Your plants’ information sticks will tell you if they prefer acidic or low-acid environments and whether they require high or low nitrogen levels.  Use a roto-tiller or garden fork to work through and loosen the existing soil and to blend it with any amendments you’ve added. Till through the topsoil about six inches deep.A power roto-tiller will make the work easier. If you don’t have one, the most affordable option would be to rent one from your home improvement store.  After tilling the soil, start planting your shortest plants first, like ferns, ivy, and other low creepers. These may include plants that define your garden’s edges and groundcovers that form its bed. Use a hand trowel to dig a hole large enough for each seedling’s root ball.Space your plants according to your coverage expectations. For immediate coverage, space them two or three inches apart. To lower your cost, space them about ten inches apart. Try massaging or loosening the root systems a bit to encourage them to grow.  Once you’ve planted a row of groundcovers and edging, proceed to add your mid-sized woodland flowers. Dig a hole to accommodate each plant’s root ball with your hand trowel. Place your seedlings in regular intervals across your garden according to your cost and coverage needs.Be sure that your flowers and shrubs will receive enough light for their needs. Most flowering plants require lots of sun.  If you’re purchasing larger shrubs or small trees, look for specimens with unblemished bark and strong, evenly spread branches. Dig a hole for the root ball, and cover the bottom with compost or manure. For most trees, the top of the root ball should be level with the ground.Stake a newly planted tree for about year after planting by tying a short stake 1.5 feet (45 cm) in length at a 45 degree angle to its trunk. The nursery or home improvement store will carry stakes and tree ties.     , Water your newly planted seedlings thoroughly, so the soil is saturated, to encourage root growth. When you’ve finished watering, cover areas around each plant with an inch-deep layer of mulch, and take special care to cover any trees’ planted area.Mulch will help retain moisture and keep away undesired weeds. Water two to three times per week for several weeks until the seedlings start to develop coverage. If you’ve chosen native plants, rainfall in your area should be adequate to sustain them once they’ve established themselves.	Start with a small planting area. Observe how much light your planting area receives. Choose an assortment of native species. Purchase plants according to your cost and coverage needs. Use curved borders for your garden. Include a walkway for foot traffic through large planting areas. Consider testing your soil. Remove undesired plant matter from the garden area. Add peat moss or other amendments into the soil. Till the planting area. Start with low growing groundcovers. Add mid-height flowers and shrubs. Finish with taller shrubs and trees. Water your garden well and cover with bark mulch.
Do not plant an Ohia tree over 9,000 ft (2,743 m) in elevation. Ohia trees are not suited for high elevations, and will likely wilt and die if planted too high.Higher elevations likely have too little oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain an Ohia tree, and may not have enough humidity.  If you live in an area above 9,000 feet (2,743 m), consider finding a different species of tree to plant.; , Ohia trees need near-constant sunlight during daylight hours, and so should be planted in an open space that affords plenty of light.Do not plant your Ohia tree near a large wall or building that will block the sun. Similarly, do not plant the Ohia near a larger tree or bush whose foliage will prevent sun from reaching the Ohia.  Young Ohia trees and bushes that have not fully grown may prefer partial sun (about 6 hours of sun exposure a day), until they reach maturity. If your Ohia is in the ground, you won’t be able to change its sun exposure as it matures. However, if the Ohia tree is in a planter, you can move the planter to keep the juvenile tree in partial sunlight.  Ohia trees will become unhealthy if the soil they are planted in becomes saturated and waterlogged. To avoid this problem, plant your Ohia in a soil with good drainage. The soil should also be rich in organic material, which will nourish the growing Ohia tree and keep it healthy.You can purchase a planting soil mixture at your local hardware store, or at a local plant nursery or gardening center. Ask the sales staff for assistance, and request that they help you find a soil that drains well.  Unlike various other tree species, Ohia trees can be grown from seeds relatively easily.If you live in Hawaii, you should be able to purchase Ohia seeds or a small seedling at a local plant nursery or gardening center. If you live elsewhere, you can order Ohia seeds online. Check with plant retailers that specialize in Hawaiian flora, including Maui Native Nursery and Kauai Seascape nursery.  The seeds of the Ohia tree are tiny, and a cluster of them may look like a small pile of dust. These seeds grow in ¼-inch (0.65 cm) pods on the Ohia tree. The seed pods burst open when they have matured, and allow the seeds to disperse.  Fill any size planter with a planting soil mixture, and lightly sprinkle the tiny Ohia seeds on top of the soil. Ohia seeds will grow best if exposed to plenty of sunlight, so place the planter outdoors, away from shade. Water the seeds lightly at first, with a spray bottle, until they start to sprout.Even if you’re unable to place the Ohia seeds in full sunlight, they’ll likely still grow. The seeds are tough and can grow in practically any light conditions. The seeds will grow best between 50°F and 93°F (10–34°C). If the outdoor temperatures dip below 50 or climb above 93, bring the plant indoors to more stable temperatures.  If you can obtain a cutting from an Ohia tree in your area (perhaps from a tree owned by a friend or family member), you can use this to grow your own Ohia. Plant the Ohia cutting in soil that is porous and drains well, so the cutting isn’t drowned by repeated waterings.If the cutting is too small to stand erect in a pot full of soil on its own, you can stick a large dowel in the soil and tie the cutting to the dowel using thread.  Take your cutting from the stem or branch tips of a mature Ohia tree. The cutting that you plant should be about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length, and ¼-inch (0.65 cm) in diameter. A cutting will take time to begin establishing its own roots: at least a week or two.  Once the young Ohia tree (whether grown from seeds, a cutting, or a seedling) has begun to grow, you’ll need to transplant it from a pot directly into the ground. Plant the Ohia in organic soil. Ohia roots need to be able to absorb water but should never become waterlogged, so plant the tree in soil that drains well and is not prone to forming puddles.Ohia trees grow quickly, and will become root-bound if left in a pot for too long. Put the plant in soil in the ground as soon as it grows large enough to encourage healthy growth, or about 1 foot (0.3 meters) tall.  The Ohia roots will have sufficient room to expand in a hole of this size. Make the hole roughly the same depth as the root ball, so that the trunk of the seedling will not be buried once it’s planted.While you’re digging, turn the soil by breaking apart clumps, removing rocks, and flipping the shovelfuls of soil upside down so that the organic material can be worked through the soil. For added soil drainage, place a couple of cinder blocks at the bottom of the hole to allow for soil drainage. You should be able to purchase cinder blocks at a local hardware or landscaping store.  Once the cinder blocks are firmly in place, gently set the Ohia tree in the hole and cover the roots with a rich soil mixture. Be sure not to cover the base of the trunk with soil., Ohia trees thrive in tropical environments, and consequently need to be watered often. Plan to water your Ohia tree at least once a week, using water from a household hose. In order to keep the tree healthy and encourage its growth, you can also apply a fertilizer. Purchase an 8-8-8 or 13-13-13 fertilizer, and apply it to the base of the Ohia tree once every six months.Hours after watering, make sure that the soil is draining well. You should not see any puddles around the base of the Ohia tree, and the soil should be damp but not saturated.  Since Ohia trees frequently produce large, pleasant-smelling flowers, bees and other pollinating insects frequent the trees. Ohia trees are almost constantly in bloom, and so constantly attract insects.If you’re bothered by the bees or wasps, you can set up a bee trap or occasionally spray bees with an insecticide like Raid.  Also, avoid planting an Ohia tree within 10 feet (3 meters) of a door or garage. If large numbers of bees or wasps are frequently in the tree, they may fly into your house.  If you’re planning on growing more than a single Ohia tree, you don’t need to worry about giving the trees plenty of space in every direction, as with some other species. Ohia trees can grow well while crowded together. Plant multiple Ohia trees with as little as about 5 feet (1.5 meters) between their trunks.Over the years, as the Ohia trees grow, you may decide to prune some of the trees’ branches. Prune using a pair of pruning shears, in cases where branches from two Ohia trees overlap.	Avoid locations with high altitudes. Choose an area that gets full sunlight. Make sure that your soil has good drainage. Purchase Ohia seeds or a seedling. Plant your Ohia seeds. Plant an Ohia cutting. Re-plant an Ohia cutting or seedling into rich soil. Dig a hole that is twice as wide as the root ball. Place the seedling in the hole and cover it with soil. Water and fertilize the Ohia tree. Remove unwanted insects from the tree. Plant multiple Ohia trees near one another.

Think about the way your diet currently is and how you want to change it. It’s always good to start small -- you can’t change habits overnight. It also might help to do it with a family member or friend (or even your whole family). Having someone there to commiserate with and keep you on track can be extremely helpful., Shoot for 7-9 servings per day. Eat the ones you know you like and take this opportunity to find tasty new fruits and vegetables. Look for new recipes and preparations to help guide you. And for fruit, if in doubt, throw it in a smoothie. For vegetables, most can be roasted successfully in the oven at high heats to cook, if you aren’t planning to eat them raw. Some of the most health fruits and vegetables are:Dark, leafy greens (spinach, kale, chard, beet greens) Beets Red peppers Sweet potatoes Berries Apples Kiwis Grapes Papaya  , These are grains that include the bran, germ, and endosperm. Some common ones are barley, oats, quinoa, brown and colored rices, wheat varieties like spelt, farro, and kamut, along with many others. These are going to provide carbohydrates, but in their healthiest form. Keep in mind there are many whole-grain pastas now available, and an array of whole-grain breads that are often delicious., This is determined by the amount of fat in a 3 oz piece of meat -- it has to have less than 10 grams of total fat. Turkey and chicken are lean, but some red meats are as well. Look for cuts with “top” or “loin” in the title. Fish and lean meats are a great source of protein. These are important to eat as part of a balanced diet, but they should not be the elements you eat the most. You need to eat more vegetables and fruits than lean meats., It is the healthiest beverage around, and provides many benefits to your health. Try for 6-8 8 oz. glasses per day. Black coffee and tea are extremely low in calories, and can be part of your daily beverage rotation if you know it won’t be possible to stop drinking caffeine., These foods are often overly sweet or salty and tend to not contain much nutritional value. This means staying away from foods that contain the following ingredients:High fructose corn syrup Anything with artificial flavors or colors MSG (Monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer)  , Many health nuts believe that both meat and dairy in large quantities are harmful to people's health. They believe that your diet should be an essentially vegan (no dairy, no meat) diet that includes plenty of whole grains in addition to fruits and vegetables. Adding in some meat and dairy at times is fine, but they should not be the basis of your diet., If you eat out a lot, think about how you can cook at home to have more control over what you eat. Look through cookbooks and online to find new recipes that sound appealing. Part of becoming healthier is changing your way of eating, and new foods and dishes will be part of that. Cooking the same things you always make and just eating less can be more difficult than preparing something new with fewer calories in the same size portion., Take packed lunches to work or school. For some people, just this simple step can go a long way toward helping them eat healthier and more mindfully. Home-cooked food is going to be healthier than the vast majority of restaurant food, and will not have the same kinds of preservatives or high sodium levels., Buy the foods you need to make your new healthy dishes at home. Buy ingredients, not prepared or processed foods -- these are typically going to have the same sodium and preservative levels as restaurant food. Even though it might take time getting used to cooking at home, your food is going to be both healthier and better.  Identify the foods that you want to eliminate from your diet in both your refrigerator and your cupboards. Pay particular attention to prepackaged and processed foods -- they often have unhealthy preservatives and additives, and can be very high in sodium.Toss all trans fats. If an ingredient is "partially hydrogenated oil" this is another name for trans fats, and are a major cause of heart attacks and strokes. You will want to eventually, if not immediately, throw out all foods you have with this ingredient listed on the package.  Take stock of your current exercise regimen. If you are exercising little, you have a lot of options to explore as you become more healthy. If you are already exercising, think about how you might want to add to the activities you already do. You might want to start a new exercise class to inspire you to exercise more., A half hour of moderate exercise six days a week is all it takes to start making a difference if you’re exercising little. Keep in mind that you also don’t have to do it all at once -- ten minutes here and twenty there will work just as well., Don’t do the same thing every day (unless you love it). Walk one day, take a yoga class another, and try new activities. Check with your local gym or YMCA for their schedules and amenities. If you try and do a new activity every week or so, you might find your new favorite exercise routine., If you want to be a health nut, you need to be doing serious exercise, and moderate walks are not going to be enough. Think about what sports or kinds of training you might enjoy. You will need to do these activities most days and at a rate that allows your heart rate to stay elevated for 20-30 minutes at a time. You should also mix them up with some weight training. Some good options for cardiovascular exercise might be:   Swimming Tennis Cross-training in a gym Boot-camp style exercise course	Make a plan. Consume fruits and vegetables. Choose whole grains. Eat lean meats. Drink water. Avoid processed foods. Consider minimizing dairy and meat in your diet. Control your diet. Eat at home. Go to the grocery store with a new list. Go through your kitchen. Exercise regularly. Start your new exercise program. Make your exercise program fun. Ramp up your exercise.
Do you want style, fuel economy, interior space, safety, a car that doesn't effect the environment as much as others, or a car with a specific price. Which one of these factors is most important for you, and which is least important. It is helpful to make a list of your priorities, so you will know exactly what you are looking for., Visit the websites of major car companies and see what models they have to offer. Some companies to consider include Cadillac, Dodge, GM, Honda, Jeep, Toyota, Chevrolet, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Volkswagen, Ford, Chrysler, Volvo and there are many others. Keep in mind that not every car company will have a car that fits you, but most will.  This decision is a personal one. However you should be aware that there are valid reasons for either decision. Experts suggest asking yourself a few questions to help determine whether you want to buy new or used.If you are thinking about a used car, figure out if you can afford the possible maintenance and repair costs that come with buying used. Moreover, are you in a position to handle the time that your car may be in the repair shop? If you are thinking of buying a new car, ask yourself whether you have enough money or trade-in value for a down payment. Also ask yourself if you are willing to take the depreciation hit, as new cars lose value as soon as they are driven off the lot.  Try to come up with a list of 2-3 cars that match your needs. Look up the closest dealership that carries those specific models, and set aside a day to see the cars in person. Talk with a salesperson and be sure to take the car for a test drive. All of these steps will ensure that you are a well informed buyer.   When test driving, remember you will be spending a lot of time in this car. Ask yourself the following: are the controls easy to use (i.e. is the steering easy)? Are the seats comfortable and supportive? Does the air conditioning and heating work well? How is the stereo and does it work with your phone or mp3 player? Does the vehicle have enough power to merge on the highway? How does the car take a corner? How is your visibility? Is there too much road noise?, A car is a major purchase, so take time to reflect on the knowledge you have gained before deciding to purchase. When it is time to purchase know exactly how much the car you are buying is worth, and get the most value out of any trade-in. Always ask if there are any rebates available, as dealers typically offer them for students, military, and more.It is best to buy at the end of the month because dealers receive monthly incentives from manufactures.  Dealerships would actually rather have you finance, so you can get a better price by financing. Think about talking to your bank about getting pre-approved for the loan you will need for the car, that way you will know exactly what you can afford., There are several tricks a salesperson may use that you need to watch for. They will try to get you to focus on a monthly payment, when you should focus on the total price of the car. They may also try to give an unfair price for your trade-in.By being well informed, you will be able to overcome these tricks.	Start by making a list of your needs. Begin looking for cars that fit your needs. Decide on buying a new or used car. Narrow down your list and see the cars in person. Reflect, make your decision and get the best price. Avoid paying cash as it is actually not to your advantage. Watch out for tricks.
Don't just use these options for getting back and forth from work, but all the time.; , This will save time as well as money. You may even be able to save even more money by becoming a one-car family.  If you can do several short trips in one longer trip, you will save fuel and time. Internet map programs such as Google Maps and certain GPS devices allow convenient or even automated re-ordering of destinations to save distance and time. Make lists to avoid having to go back. Call ahead to avoid wasted trips.  For example, designate Wednesday afternoon as errand day, and make sure family members know that this is the day for grocery shopping, post office visits, and other nearby outings.  Some of your stops may be near each other. Park between some or all of them and walk.  If you wander all over the parking lot looking for that really close parking space, you'll use more gas. Don't be afraid to walk from the far end of the parking lot if it comes to that, the walk will do you good!  , Organize it with the equipment needed for common outing types such as a picnic (for instance, blanket, small cooler perhaps collapsible, cheap camera, etc) to avoid unnecessary trips home; a FEW extra pounds in a several-thousand-pounds car will consume much less fuel than a few unnecessary trips home, and no time. Consider keeping simple equipment for carrying oversized items (at least a bungee to close the trunk over a slightly oversized item) on hand, but be sure to know how to use that safely.	Walk, bike, ride the bus or join a carpool. Reduce your commute by moving closer to work or working closer to home. Combine trips. Create an errand routine. Walk between stops. Park in the first spot you find. When choosing a car look for one with an at least moderate-sized and not cumbersomely-shaped trunk.
Acrylic is a soft, malleable finish, which means it can easily be scratched or marked up if you’re not careful. To prevent doing lasting damage to your shower, pick out a product that doesn’t contain any harsh chemicals or astringents. Your best bet is to use a mild acid-based solution like Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, Formula 409 All-Purpose cleaner or Bar Keeper’s Friend.Stay away from any type of astringent cleanser, including Comet, Ajax and Scrubbing Bubbles, as well as solvents like acetone. Whenever possible, using natural derivatives to clean your bathroom will be your safest choice.; , Apply the cleaner liberally to areas where grime, soap scum and hard water stains have accumulated. Focus on spots that suffer from visible dirt or discoloration. You may need to use quite a bit of cleaner in order to penetrate multiple layers of dried-on residue.   Be sure to remove all soaps, shampoos and other hygiene products from the shower before you get started so that you can clean underneath them. Pull back the shower curtain all the way and turn on the overhead fan to keep the bathroom properly ventilated while you clean.  After a few minutes, the dingy messes that have built up on the surface of your acrylic shower will begin to dissolve. This will allow you to wipe them away with ease.If you’re dealing with particularly heavy soap scum or stains, it may help to reapply the cleaner once or twice. Use this time to take care of any other cleaning tasks you need to complete, like detailing the faucet or shower head.  Turn on the shower head and direct the flow of water over the areas of the acrylic you just sprayed. Wash away as much liquefied grime and cleaning solution as you can. Once you’ve given the shower a preliminary rinse, go over the acrylic with using a soft microfiber towel or sponge to remove any remaining residue.Never use abrasive scrubbers, such as wire brushes or rough kitchen sponges, to clean an acrylic surface. These will leave behind tiny scratches in the finish that will then trap dirt in the future, making it much harder to remove.	Choose a non-abrasive cleaning solution. Spray the product onto shower stains. Let the cleaner sit for 5-10 minutes. Rinse and wipe out the shower.
Wooden blocks, pieces of cardboard, or small, cardboard jewelry boxes work great for this. Whatever you choose needs to be smaller than your cut rubber bands. This is because you will be gluing the rubber bands on top of the base, not stretching them., Think ahead about your design, then cut apart as many rubber bands as you need. You can use all the same width, but your design will look more interesting if you use both thick and thin rubber bands., Arrange the rubber bands on your base. Play around with different widths. Try to use both thick and thin rubber bands. You can do simple stripes or diagonals. You can also create more interesting designs, such as chevron, zigzags, diamonds, or weaves. Try to leave behind some negative space on the block.You may need to cut some rubber bands shorter so that they fit your design.  You can use tacky glue or white school glue. Super glue may also work, but not hot glue. Let the glue dry before moving on., Acrylic paint will work best here, but you can also use tempera. You can use all one color, or experiment with different ones.  You can use plain white paper or even colored paper. White paint on brown packaging paper will give you a nice, rustic effect.  You can repeat the pattern over and over, or you can rotate the stamp for an interesting look. You should be able to stamp a few times before the paint becomes too pale. When that happens, simply apply more paint.	Choose your base. Cut apart some rubber bands. Plan out your design. Glue the rubber band strips onto your base. Brush paint onto the block. Press the block down onto a sheet of paper, like a stamp. Repeat the design as often as you like until the paper is covered.
When you purchase new appliances, it can be tempting to save money by installing them yourself; however, you may not install them correctly, which could result in hazards. Call a handyman or hire representatives from the store where you purchased your appliance to install the appliances for you. While it’s an added upfront expense, it will help you keep your home safe.  Frayed wires and damaged cords can not only start a fire, they can also cause electric shocks. Unplug affected cords and immediately repair or replace them.Keep laundry and other materials from building up around the cords as this could create a fire hazard or disguise your damaged cords.  Extension cords can only handle so much wattage before they overheat and become a fire hazard. Additionally, they are meant to be a temporary solution to an electrical need and are not meant to be relied upon regularly. You should always plug your appliances directly into a wall socket.You should also never plug an appliance into a two-prong outlet. Make sure that you are using an outlet with a surge protector., A damaged washing machine may leave you with soapy or sopping wet clothing, while a broken dryer won’t be able to completely dry your clothes.   Machines can get damaged by items left in pockets, so remember to check them while you load the machine., Ask your handyman to do a maintenance check on your machines once a year to make sure that they’re in good working order. This will allow you to repair your appliances before they become a hazard.	Call a professional to install new appliances. Look for frayed wires and damaged cords. Avoid using an extension cord. Watch for signs of damaged machines. Get your machines checked annually.
Free up your hands to do work by resting your guitar on its back. You can use a table, a box, your guitar case, even your own lap. Alternatively, if your guitar has a neck strap, wear the neck strap and turn the guitar face up. Make sure the guitar's head is not touching anything to ensure that your tuning pegs don't get messed with in the process, and ideally place it on a block to stabilize it.; , Some people prefer to use a paper towel, microfiber cloth, or dry dish towel that they fold into eighths; other people prefer to use a clean cotton diaper.Any number of cloth or paper products will work, you just want to make sure that it's clean, dry, and relatively soft. Instead of applying the cleaning solution directly to the strings, which will also result in your guitar being sprayed, spray the solution onto your rag first. This will prevent any excess cleaning solution from gathering and being difficult to remove.For a guitar with nylon strings, a non-dampened towel or one slightly dampened with water will suffice. For guitars with steel strings, there are guitar string cleaners that are manufactured for use like Fast-Fret String Cleaner, Dunlop Ultraglide, Dr.Stringfellow, and the like. However, you do not have to use these products if you cannot afford them. 70-90% rubbing alcohol can also be effective, as can pre-shaving gel., With your rag now wet and ready to clean your strings, slide half of the sheet underneath the guitar strings near the bridge or bottommost portion for the strings. Then fold the remaining half of the cloth over so that the entire cloth covers both sides of the strings.  You want to make sure that you go all the way from the bridge/saddle area up to the nut of your guitar. Pay special attention to the portions of string located on the fingerboard as you most assuredly touch these every time, and, if you finger pick your instrument, the portions over the soundhole. Apply downward pressure to clean the top portion, and pull upward some to be sure that you get the underside as well.   It is important to clean both sides of the strings just as it is important to clean both sides of your teeth. Don't worry if the head gets lifted off its mount; even if the tuning pegs get a little messed up you can always retune your guitar. You will probably notice that your guitar strings change color a little, or that the cloth comes away with grey streaks.This is a sign that your efforts are working.	Position your guitar. Select a rag and cleaning solution. Position the rag. Slide the folded rag along the strings.
A driving rehabilitation specialist can observe you driving and help you find ways to develop more ergonomic habits. If your profession involves driving, talk to your employer or union representative. Contact your local jurisdiction’s department of driver services for more information about driver rehabilitation.You can also find resources on the Association for Driver Rehabilitation Specialists website., Ask your primary care doctor to examine the affected area. They can offer pain management tips, a prescription medication, or refer you to a specialist.Check with your insurer to make sure any medication or specialist care is covered and in-network to avoid unexpected medical bills.  Ask your doctor or specialist if your arm pain indicates any potential muscle, bone, or joint issues. Frequent driving or improper driving habits can result in issues like carpal tunnel syndrome, rotator cuff injuries, repetitive strain injury, or bursitis.Driving can also cause and aggravate arthritis, especially in older adults. Describe the motions that cause pain, the affected areas, and whether the pain is dull or sharp. Ask your doctor or specialist, “Are my symptoms signs of any chronic disorders? Will medication or physical therapy be effective treatment options?”  , If your pain continues despite adopting ergonomic driving habits, your doctor can recommend a variety of treatments. Common options include anti-inflammatory or anti-pain medication and physical therapy.Depending on the severity of your case, your doctor may also recommend other treatments, such as cortisone injections, steroid injections, or surgery.	Consult a driving rehabilitation specialist. Make an appointment with your primary doctor. Ask about musculoskeletal disorders. Discuss your treatment options.
This is so the airbag can deactivate. If you have a radio with a theftlock system, you might want to unlock it first or you will be taking it to the dealer to fix it. , Some are held on with 7mm screws, push fasteners., These usually pull off and are held in place with clips. Look for screws and be careful as this is plastic., These are usually held on by several bolts., Loop the seatbelt through the steering wheel instead., This is what holds the column to the steering gear. You may have to move the steering wheel to access the bolt. Sometimes this is outside, or inside the vehicle. On many front wheel drive cars with rack and pinion steering, this means dropping the engine cradle 4 inches (10.2 cm) to access it. You may have to peel back a rubber boot to access this as well. Make a note as to how far you had to turn the wheel and return it to the original position after removing the bolt. For example, if you had to turn the wheel 1/2 turn to the right, turn it back 1/2 turn to the left. Use a piece of masking tape or use some other means to keep the wheel from turning after this is disconnected. Turning the wheel too far or losing center can destroy expensive parts., Cars with shifters on the column usually have a cable that runs to the transmission and that could be inside or outside the firewall. Unhook this too., If your ride has a shifter on the column and the shift indicator is mechanical, you will need to make sure you don't break the cable as you lower the column. If you have one of these, make a mark where the clip goes and remove it before you lower the column. Many of these are parts are NLA (no longer available) from the dealer as these were only made through the late 1990s.,, The wheel on the new column needs to be pointed straight ahead. If yours had the mechanical shift indicator, install this on the new part before raising it all the way and cinching it up., Reinstall the boot over the coupler.,,,,, You are responsible for make sure your vehicle is safe to drive.	Disconnect the negative battery cable and wait at least 15 or 20 minutes before working on it.Remove the plastic trim from the steering column. Remove the hush panels from under the dash. Remove the knee bolster from under the steering column. Remove the steel backing behind the knee bolster. Make sure the front wheels are pointed straight ahead, but do not lock the ignition if it locks the steering column. Remove the pinch bolt from the steering coupler. Remove any cables or wires from the steering column. Most 1989 and newer cars have four 14mm nuts that hold the column to the dash.Carefully remove the column from the vehicle and set aside. To install a new column, line it up inside the coupler and fasten it to the dash. Install the pinch bolt so it's tight.Reconnect any cables or wires you disconnected.Reinstall the steel backing and the knee bolster.Reinstall any trim and the hush panels you removed to access the steering column.Reconnect the battery. Make sure the steering operates correctly before taking the car out in traffic.
Place your pot on the stove and set the heat to high. Bring the water to a rolling boil, about 10 minutes. Pour two cups (473.18 ml) of the boiling water down your sink drain.Reserve the remaining water for a later use.  Let the baking soda set for 5 to 10 minutes. Depending on how clogged your drain is, you may need to let it set for longer, like 20 to 30 minutes.Make sure to remove your sink stopper before doing this.  Use the water that you boiled. Mix the vinegar and water together until they are well combined., Then quickly cover your drain with a plug or wet towel to prevent the mixture from bubbling out of your drain. Let the mixture set for 10 to 15 minutes.If your sink trap is very clogged, then you may need to let the mixture set for longer, like 30 minutes.  Pour the rest of the boiling water down your drain. This will help remove any remaining dirt and grime from your sink trap.If the water has cooled, then heat it to a rolling boil again before pouring it down the drain. If your sink is still clogged, then you may need to remove your sink trap to clean it properly.	Bring six cups (1,419.53 ml) of water to a boil on your stove. Pour ½ cup (118.3 ml) of baking soda down your drain. Mix 1 cup (236.59 ml) of vinegar in 1 cup of hot water. Pour the mixture down your sink drain. Rinse your drain.
Some glides are secured to the inside edge of the face frame with a screw and mounted into a plastic bracket that is attached to the inside rear of the cabinet.   Sometimes with this type of mounting, the glides can become slightly bent or twisted. Check to see if this is the case. If so, remove the glide screws and the glide, then use a little pressure or twisting to return the glide to shape, if possible. This should be very simple. If too bent, then both the right and left glides will need to be replaced, as they are sold only in a set.  Be sure to replace the damaged, useless glides.   Take one to your home center to get a proper replacement. They cost about $6 to $8 for a set. The good news, however, is that this type of damage is usually very “fixable” and replacement is not needed.  More often, your glides will be mounted on wood rails that run from the backside of the face frame to the inside rear of the cabinet. The glide can be adjusted at several points along the railing and are usually mounted with 3 or four screws per rail.   If your drawer binds at the top, against the face frame, this is a fairly simple adjustment.  Use the Phillips screwdriver to loosen the screw that holds the drawer glide to the inside of the face frame.   Loosen it only. Do not remove it. This screw is located in a vertical oblong hole in the glide to allow for up and down adjustment.  With the mounting screw loosened, slide the drawer glide downward and retighten the screw.   Repeat the same process with the drawer glide at the opposite side of the drawer space. Do any necessary fine-tuning to the glides and tighten the screws to secure the glides.  If the glides are mounted in a bracket at the inside rear of the cabinet, the mounting bracket typically has elongated slots for adjustment.   Loosen the mounting screws enough to adjust the bracket. Tighten ONE screw enough to secure the bracket so you can test the adjustment. When satisfied with the adjustment, you may tighten all screws. NOTE: Because of the way the glides are designed and mounted, it is very unlikely that a drawer would bind at the bottom.	Check for the presence of bent plastic guide brackets. Replace overly bent guides. Remove the drawer and set it aside. Loosen the screw that holds the glide. Slide the glide downward. Adjust the mounting brackets if necessary.
If you are near a source of water from a pressurized system, and have sufficient hoses available, use them to extinguish minor fires, and wet the potential fuel in the immediate area.  Dig a shallow trench around the perimeter of the blaze, or scrape potential fuel away, exposing as much bare earth as possible. Concentrate on the area "downwind" of the flames, since the wind will push the blaze in that direction.   Use heavy equipment, if available, to create a larger firebreak if the situation warrants it. A farm tractor with a disk, a bulldozer, or other equipment can quickly establish a sizable fire break.  Use buckets, pots, or other containers to carry water to the blaze if no other fire fighting equipment is available, and a stream or pond, or other source of water is nearby. If you're close enough to the brush to use a hose, take advantage of the water as soon as possible.   try to control the burn by wetting the ground in front of the direction the fire might be traveling. If it's blowing in a particular direction, watch the wind to anticipate it's motion and cut it off at the pass.  If you must flee a fire, choose a path which can be traversed quickly and easily, away from the path of the fire. If smoke and heat becomes intense, cover your mouth with your shirt, preferably wetting it first.  If your leaf pile has gotten slightly out of control, that's one thing, but a serious brush fire needs to be handled immediately by professionals. Use your judgment and call the fire department as soon as a brush fire escapes a manageable area or size.	Look at what resources are available to contain the fire. Use a tool to create a "fire break" if no water is available. try to extinguish the fire with water. Be prepared to evacuate the area if danger reaches an unacceptable level. Call the fire department.
Not following the directions is a good way to get yourself eliminated from consideration pretty quickly. Make sure to read over the application carefully before you start to fill it out. For example, a hard-copy application may ask you to use a pen with blue or black ink. Likewise, you may be asked to submit additional information online in a certain format.; , Like other reality programs and game shows, Deal or No Deal is looking for genuine participants. Don't exaggerateyour accomplishments or fabricate a life history. Instead, focus on your real accomplishments and look at how you can present them in an engaging way.   Ask a good friend who knows you well to help you pull out awesome details from your life.  As with failing to follow the directions, incomplete forms are another insta-kill for your chances at getting on the show. If you don't know how to answer a certain question, get help from a friend. Examples of strange questions you may have to answer include:   What is your weirdest quality? Draw a picture of yourself.  Get at least one headshot and a full body shot. If you take your own pictures, stand in front of a light or neutral background. This eliminates unnecessary distractions from the main focus of the picture: you.  It may be months before you hear any news on your application. Deal of No Deal, like other shows, casts months in advance of its shooting schedule. You have no way of knowing where in the cycle the show is at the time of your application.  Major televisions shows, such as Deal of No deal, hold auditions for hundreds of candidates at a time. It will be an all-day event, so prepare yourself accordingly. Make sure that you bring plenty of water and snacks with you. Also, you will probably have to wait outside for a while, so bring a jacket if the weather is cool or an umbrella to shield yourself from the sun if it is hot.  Wear something flattering but not overly revealing. If you have a great figure, show it off in a form-fitting outfit. This goes for women and men, too. Don't wear anything with a logo on it, however, as the producers will have to blur it out.  Deal or No Deal is interested in people with stories that people can relate to, and to people who are relatablein general. Talk about yourself, what you've done, your hopes, and your dreams. Speak about obstacles you've encountered and how you overcame them. Don't be afraid to tell the producers about your deepest, most secret fear. Don't just dryly present these as facts, show your personality. Don't be afraid to let your emotions show. Some extra tidbits to keep in mind are:   If you have a tragedy in your life, such as losing a family member or overcoming a serious illness, by all means, tell the story to the producers. They love these kinds of stories as they're great for narrative building. Producers also appreciate quirkiness. If there is something about you that is just a little bit off, let it show. Uniqueness matters.  Enthusiasm counts for shows like Deal of No Deal. While you're waiting, make sure that you keep your energy high. For example, do something that gets your heart pumping, such as jumping-jacks. You can also listen to your favorite dance tune while bopping your head, or better yet, dancing to it.	Follow the directions. Be honest. Fill out the form completely. Send in photos if required. Have patience. Be prepared for a long wait. Dress appropriately. Be prepared to share your story. Demonstrate high energy.
,,,,, Grind off the buckles from inside the bag and pull the buckles away from the bag.This will allow the stiffener to lie flatter against the leather. If you feel confident about pop riveting or bolting the buckles back on then go ahead and grind off the buckles. Otherwise it is not absolutely necessary to remove the buckles., You also can substitute luan, or 16ga-24 ga metal in place of the plastic. The purpose of the plastic is to keep the bags shape once the bag is dry. Apply one coat of contact cement to the inside front of the leather bag and one coat to the stiffener. Let dry. Apply another coat. Push the pieces together almost immediately after applying the cement. Do not let the cement dry before pushing the pieces together. Work fast. Drill 5/32" holes through the leather and stiffener to provide holes for pop rivets or small bolts(8-32 used with acorn nuts), use washers under the bolt or pop rivet head and washers on the other side as well to increase the holding strength. Use three across the top of the front and a couple lower down. Paint the rivets or bolts if desired to help disguise them . Also install two on the right side and two on the left side of the top. To reinforce the sides, cut plastic strips about 4-5" wide x12" long and cement from the top of the sides. Secure with pop rivets or small acorn nuts and bolts.	Soak the bags in hot water for 30 seconds in a laundry sink or bathtub. ,  Stuff the bags with newspaper.It will take at least one Sunday edition. ,  When wet, mold the top back into shape. ,  Leave to dry for at least one day. ,  Take out the newspaper. ,  Optional Step.  If you want to maintain the shape longer you can put stiffeners in as follows:  Cut out the shape(pattern) of the flat saddlebag top piece and the saddlebag front from the plastic sheet, making the pattern 1" smaller on the outer edge so the plastic piece fits onto the top and front.
To begin using their service, spotify requires you to sign up, but it is fairly easy. Go to their website and choose between "play free" or "premium" (premium allows you to listen to music with no commercials and download songs to your phone so you can listen to your music even when you don't have service). Then, you can sign up with Facebook or with your email address and you can begin to listen to music.; , Spotify has several different options for listening to music. You can download their program on your computer, which allows you stay logged in permanently, or you can visit the Spotify online web player (this runs similarly to the program on your computer).   You can also download the spotify app to your tablet or phone. With this app you can still listen to music free, but you won't be able to select individual songs -- you will just be able to shuffle whole albums or playlists, which may make it difficult to discover new music.  To begin your search for new music, it can always be helpful to start off with artists you already like. On the spotify player, you can type in your favorite artists in the search bar and you can click on some of their albums or the artist themself. To find new artists, its helpful if you visit the actual artist's page.  Spotify has created a function that allows you to check out artists that are similar to the artists you already like, which can be beneficial when you are trying to discover new music. The "Related Artists" link is on the right side of the page, next to the "popular music." It usually displays the top seven artists like the one you are listening to, but if you click on the link, you will be directed to a page with 20 other artists., Spotify has also created a page that gives you the option to browse different genres, new releases, music in the top of the charts, and even has a discover page. Each of these pages gives you the option to find new music, either by trying out different genres or going with Spotify's suggestions. Click the "Browse" like in the top left corner of your Spotify page to explore new music.Charts: Within the browse option, this page allows you to look at music that is ranked in the top 50 in the country. You can check out music from America, or from all over the world. You can also visit the "Viral 50 by Country" page, which allows you to see what songs are ranked in the top 50 of each country. Genres and Moods: This page is helpful if you are feeling in a certain mood or looking for a certain genre, but don't have an idea of specific artists to look for. Spotify has created a number of genres and moods like "Chill," "Workout," "Jazz," "Travel," etc. as well as creating playlists within each of those categories for even more specificity. For example, within the "Chill" category a few of the playlists are "Your Favorite Coffeehouse," "Stress Relief," and "Autumn Leaves." Within the "Jazz" category one of the playlists is "This is: Frank Sinatra." In the categories that are more genre based rather than mood based, Spotify has listed a number of well known or popular artists and albums within that genre. New Releases: What better way to find new music than by checking out the new releases? This page consists of music that was recently released. It is not grouped by any specific genre or category, so you'll have to do some sifting to find music. Discover: This page is uniquely created for you as a user, and is improved more and more by the amount of time you spend on Spotify listening to music. Spotify has several different categories like "Top Recommendations for You," "New Releases for You," "Because you listened to..." and "Suggested for You Based on..." Essentially, Spotify is able to take the music you listen to and find similar artists or genres that you might like so that you can explore new music.  Spotify carries a social media aspect to it, in that you can add friends and view their pages to see what music they are listening to. If you know of a certain friend who shares similar music taste with you, then visit their page by searching for their name in the search bar.

Before you try importing the bike yourself, look up the legality around importing bikes to your country. Most countries allow you to import bicycles as long as they are subject to a safety inspection at the border. You may also not be able to import bicycles from certain countries, based on the rules around importing and shipping in your country.You can also look at your country’s Customs and Border Protection website for more information.  Shipping a bike by air is often done if you are also flying from the country and want to fly the bike with you. Shipping by ground is more common and may be easier to do if you are importing the bike from afar. It may also be cheaper to ship the bike by mail.   If you are buying the bike from a foreign bike dealer, ask them if they’d suggest shipping by air or by ground. They may be able to advise the easiest option for you.  You will need to package the bicycle so it can be shipped or flown to your country. You can purchase cardboard boxes made for bicycle parts at your local bike shop or post office.You can also invest in bike travel cases made of durable plastic. A bike travel case may be a good idea if you plan to ship the bike again or travel with it in the future.  You will need to pay the importing costs for bringing the bike into your country. The import fees may be a percentage of the total cost of the bike, usually around 4-5%. You can find the exact import fee costs by contacting the Customs and Borders Protection department in your country.	Check the legal requirements for importing bikes. Decide if you are going to ship by air or by ground. Get a shipping box for the bike. Pay the importing costs.
It's best to start off by writing about a something simple like a legendary creature before you work on more elaborate topics. So pick a random legendary creature - for example, a dragon, and begin by getting down dragon-related song ideas.; , A good progressive rock song always tells an interesting story or describes an event in important detail to display the significance of it. So, rather than just describing things, figure out the location of the story, think up necessary characters, decide the time period of the story, and decide where you're going to take it and how it will end. Write down as many ideas as you can and then choose the most suitable ones. , Introduce the character(s) and the goal that needs to be accomplished. Remember, there has to be some sort of goal in the story. At least one character must want something for things to happen.  Never rely on the chorus to flesh out a song, because this is lazy. Your song's chorus should be more to-the-point than descriptive.  Make sure it's adventurous, and if you want it can of course be nonsensical too. Quirky things are allowed to happen in progressive, so add them where you can.  Send the story in a completely different direction so you can bring in lots of new ideas. If you're writing about a dragon, maybe you can reveal in the song that the dragon's actually misunderstood and means no harm. Or maybe the dragon isn't a dragon at all - maybe it's a figment of one's imagination. Try out different twists until one sticks.  Using a thesaurus, pick out as many interesting descriptive words as you can. Use these to your advantage to transform a good line in a song into an even better line. For example, instead of the line "The dragon breathed fire." you could instead have "Hellish blasts of inferno were launched from the dragon's throat."  , Don't cram so many descriptive and unusual words into one sentence that it sounds silly.  Oh, no, there's a lot more to experiment with in progressive rock lyrics. Experiment with the number of lines in a verse, from small, two-line verses to long and epic ones. Decide which lines you want to rhyme and which you don't want to. Chop and change each of the verses so each of them are of sizes relative to the point in the song's story. You can even convert one or some of the song's lines into quotes said by the song's characters if you wish!  , Maybe there's a lesson to be learnt in this song? Maybe there's a secret that the listener has to uncover from it? Maybe your song can have multiple hidden meanings? For beginners adding in a hidden meaning to a song (and making sure it isn't obvious) can be quite difficult, but one thing you can do is create an artificial meaning from your lyrics. Evaluate what you have written and see if there's anything you can get out of it, and if there isn't, alter some of the lyrics with the meaning you may have come up with.  A lot of progressive rock bands enjoy giving their songs titles that are not mentioned anywhere in the song, or titles mentioned only once or twice in the song. Few progressive rock songs have a title mentioned frequently within the piece, but this doesn't mean you don't have to.  Sign your surname under the song for example. Add the song's length (make it up - for example, 9:17), and if you want to you can decide where in your song that the lengthy guitar and keyboard solos come in and such. Unless you're not typing it, format your song in a font and colour that reflects what it is about, to give it a fancy look.	First, begin by deciding what your song will be about. Now, you're going to wrap a story around this topic. Now you've thought of a story, start writing!  , For the first two to three verses, set the scene by describing what is happening, making sure you suck the listener into this song's world. If the song has a chorus, it's good to not include the chorus too much - only at points where it is required. Now continue your story, implementing as many of the ideas that you decided to try as you can. Once you've written a few verses, add in a twist. Remember to make your song poetic. But also remember to not overdo it as well. But don't stop at creative words. Make sure the song has some sort of meaning. Once the lyrics are finished, you can give your song a title. Add finishing touches. And there you have it, a set of lyrics to a progressive rock song that you've wrote and are quite rightly yours!
"Powerhouse singing" is typically referred to by the general public as belting. Belting, however, doesn't always equal very loud vocals. Belting is a specific vocal style most commonly found in broadway singing. It gives the illusion that the chest voice is carried up very high into the head voice range. Actually, skillful singers must learn to mix the two voices to create a seamless and pressure free tone. Carrying only chest voice as high as it can go will create an over abundance of pressure and cause damage. Chest voice is the voice you typically use to speak in and resonates mostly in your chest. Head voice is the higher, lighter voice most people use when singing very softly and it resonates mostly in your head. For the purposes of this article, we will use the terms "powerhouse vocals" and "belting" interchangeably.; , In order from lightest to heaviest, they are soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic.    Soubrette is a term used for both color and range. Soubrette voices (such as Britney Spears) typically don't have much range or power, and therefore may not be able to belt.  Lyric voices are light, but heavier than soubrettes and if their voices are used correctly they will easily overpower Dramatic singers. Lyric singers belt with ease and power, but sometimes the sound might be too thin for some to listen to all the time.(such as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhtxYxeZ6I&feature=related (Celine Dion), although their voices tend to have a thinner, possibly more nasal sound.  Spinto is an Italian term that means "pushed." Spinto singers, such as Christina Aguilera, can handle belting at intermittent levels, and typically sound very edgy.  Dramatic voices are the heaviest and fullest of all vocal timbres. Laura Branigan is generally regarded as having a dramatic vocal timbre, she was able to belt for long periods of time and has an extremely strong resonance. People with dramatic voices can handle long periods of belting and can typically sing over loud orchestras.  There are three terms to describe range:   The first is alto (or contralto) and it's the lowest voice of all female voices. Toni Braxton is an alto. Alto voices can typically sing from F3 to F5, although some can go much lower and higher. Next there is mezzo-soprano, or "middle soprano." Mezzo-soprano singers can typically sing from A3 to A5, although again, this can vary. The highest of the female voices is soprano. Sopranos can typically sing from C4 (also known as middle C) to A5 (also known as high A). These definitions are for classical vocalists though, and in pop/modern vocals, these definitions are just an estimate. To test your range, simply go to a piano or keyboard and find middle C. Just about anyone can vocalize a middle C. Sing against that, and see how high you can go above it and how low you can go below it. This will give you a general idea of which term describes your range.  Toni Braxton is an alto which means she has a vocal color that is darker in color than a soprano and is more comfortable singing low (but can certainly sing high) , but she does have a very powerful voice.  Simply put, mixed voice is just what it's called - a mix between chest voice and head voice, lying between those two registers. Learning to sing with mixed voice and strengthening mixed voice takes a great deal of strain off of your voice when belting, and it also enables you to belt even higher. Mixed voice has a tendency to sound slightly nasal because it resonates mostly in the nasal cavity. Don't worry about this. As long as it's only slightly nasal and not excessively so, it's OK.  Always remember to support your breath very well! If you don't, your belting will be very "pitchy" and generally just not sound good. Relax and trust your voice. Don't try to force it at all. Belting is not something that you can be good at overnight. It takes a lot of practice. Think of it as yelling over music, but don't actually yell! As said before, support that breath! Also, keep good posture. When belting, a good rule of thumb is to make sure you're not tightening your diaphragm up too much. You want your breathing when singing to be more in your stomach than in your chest. When breathing while singing, make sure your stomach is expanding.  Some people actually forget to take breaths when belting, resulting in them running out of breath mid-note.  Tightening up your jaw will compromise the sound of your belting, noticeably so.  Some of the best singers out there can't sing over the sound of bombs, and that's OK. Just like range, power isn't everything. Just work what you have!  , Singing should never be a painful experience! If you experience pain while singing, that is your body telling you that you are doing something wrong or pushing it beyond it's limits. You should never be hoarse (or even worse, completely voiceless) after belting through a song, or even a whole set. If you find that you can't belt without pain or a loss of voice, consult with a voice teacher so you can learn to properly belt without risking your vocal health.	Get familiar with terminology. Keep in mind that everyone has a unique vocal timbre, or "color" of voice. Once you have figured out your vocal timbre, now's the time to figure out your range. Remember however, range is not everything and certainly doesn't say whether you can be a belter or not. Become familiar with mixed voice. Now the fun part - belting!, Remember to breathe!, Keep your jaw relaxed. Remember that not all voices are equipped to belt effectively, and this is OK. The most important thing to remember though is that if it hurts, STOP!
Since the best readers read with a purpose, it makes sense for you to begin with materials you want to or need to read in your everyday life. These can include things such as short and simple newspapers and magazine articles, work memos, schedules and medical instructions.  The best way to get familiar with the words on the page is to say them out loud. Working with a teaching partner, "sound out" unfamiliar words and use the pictures, verbal explanations and context to figure our the meaning of the new words.  Reading often and for sustained, uninterrupted periods of time will help you develop vocabulary and become a more proficient reader. Set aside specific amounts of time each day to devote to reading. Keep track of what you read and for how long by creating a reading log.	Choose meaningful reading material. Read aloud. Make time to read.
This is very important, since this will be the person you will go yandere for. You can either choose someone you are in love with, or someone you feel you can appear to be in love with. It doesn't even have to be a love, really. It could be a sibling or a friend. It's just love that's the most famous yandere-type.; , If it's someone you don't hang around with that often, you could stare at them smiling, creepily. You could begin talking to that person after a few days. If it's someone around you, you could still act a bit odd (like staring more than often, gazing into their eyes while they are talking) and talk to them more often.  Note down things about them and follow them everywhere. But don't be seen!  , First things first, you should seem adorable. Act like the ideal, cute and kind girlfriend/sister/brother/friend, etc. Giggle, show lots of care and tilt your head. Play with your hair and bite your lip, gently!  , Every time your beloved hangs out with someone else besides you, give them the death glare! Your logic through this whole thing should be: Why would they ever need anyone else but me? Try having them all for yourself.  Now, this is a daring step but if you really want to be a yandere, you need to get more violent. Gently threaten people to make them leave your beloved. Act more creepy, like if you're cutting vegetables then suddenly stop and look at the knife, asking the beloved something like, "You do love me, right?" or "We're friends, aren't we?", trying to make them uncomfortable. Start questioning things straight out.  You didn't mean for anyone to find it, now did you? Remember it's not bad to get in trouble sometimes!   , You do want to appear as the ideal wife, so cook for them and do anything to get their approval. Respect them.	Find your crush. Notice that person. Stalk them. Be cute. Act jealous. Become more violent. You could write in a cute little diary how much you wanted to slaughter the teacher who gave your beloved person an F today, and so on.... And, whoops!, Be friends with your beloved's family. Finished.

When the song begins and Miley is singing "boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap" just clap along in time with the music. The dancing doesn't start until the lyrics kick in. Are you ready?; , When Miley sings "pop it" extend your left arm out in front of you, at shoulder height, as far as it will go.   When she sings "lock it" drop down to your right, bending your knees. At the same time, hold your elbows out from your body - almost like you're pretending to have chicken wings!  , Now, on "polka dot it" shuffle to the left, taking two steps. As you shuffle, point the index finger on your right hand and waggle it from side to side, in time with your shuffling.  Tuck your thumbs into your belt (real or imaginary) then on "country", point the heel of your right foot and on "fy", point the heel of your left. It helps to imagine you're wearing cowboy boots!  , Turn your body so you're facing slightly towards the left. On "hip" kick out with your right foot and cross your arms in front of you.   On "hop" pull your leg and arms back in, so you're standing up straight with your hands on your hips. On "it" bend your knees and hunch your shoulders forward, keeping your hands on your hips.  When Miley says "put your hawk", step sideways with your right foot. As you step, cross your arms in front of you so your right hand is resting on your left elbow and your left hand is resting on your right elbow.   Then on "in the sky" lift your hands from your elbows (but keep your arms crossed) so your hands look like the wings of a bird. At the same time, kick your left foot out in front of you (when your hands are making the wing shape) then bring it back in to meet your right foot.  Keeping your arms crossed in front of you, lean from side to side - first to the left, then to the right.  On the word "jump", turn slightly to the right and scoop your left foot in front of you.   Jump off the ground and turn in the air, so that when you land on your left foot, you are facing slightly towards the left. On the word "left" place your right foot down on the ground, extended in front of your left.  On the phrase "stick it", bring your left foot up to meet your right and stomp it down on the ground, firmly placing your hands at your sides.   On "glide", step your left foot backwards then glide your right foot along the floor to join it. As you glide, push your right arm out in front of you, away from your body.  Stand up straight, lift your right leg, cross it over your left and touch your toe off the ground. Then move your leg out to the right and touch your toe off the ground again. Bend your right knee and lift your leg behind you, while leaning back with your left hand to touch your foot.  Take two steps towards the right.  As Miley sings "shuffle in", face slightly towards the left and take two steps backward, diagonally.   As you do this, bend your arms at the elbows and bring them up and down - they should be facing up when you're stepping with your left foot and down when you're stepping with your right. When Miley sings the word "diagonal", turn to face slightly towards the right and take two more diagonal steps backwards, this time leading with the right foot. Don't forget the arms.  Here's an easy one. "When the drum hits", kick out with your left foot and punch out with your right arm. Then repeat, this time kicking with your right foot and punching with your left arm.  Step your feet together and place your hands on your hips.  On "one-footed", swing your upper body towards the right, then follow with your feet so you're facing towards the back of the room.   Then when you hear "180° twist" hop three times on your left foot until you're facing the front again. Lift your arms up to the sides (with your elbows bent) as you hop. When you reach the front, stamp your right foot down and straighten your arms by your side.  Repeat the same zig-zag move you did at the start of the chorus.   After you've touched your right foot with your hand, place your right foot down on the word "step". On the word "slide" take a step towards the left, and drag your right foot towards you. Your body should be pointing towards the right corner of the room.  On the word "lean" punch with your left hand, on the word "it" punch with your right. Then, on the word "left" snap the fingers on your left hand, throw your head backwards and bend your right knee so only your toes are touching the floor.  Pretty self explanatory! On the word "clap" lean forwards towards your right knee and clap down low. On the word "three" clap at chest level and on the word "times" clap above your head.  As Miley sings "shake it out" turn towards the left and do a full 360 degree spin, shaking out your body as you go.  On "throw it all together", take a step forward with your left foot, then bend your knees as you lean forward and throw your right arm out in front of you.   When you hear "that's how we roll" step backwards with your right foot, followed by your left. On the word "roll" throw your hands up.  So that's all the moves to the Hoedown Throwdown! Now you know what you're doing, you can just keep repeating the steps for the rest of the song. Have fun!	Clap along. Pop it, lock it. Polka dot it. Countrify it. Hip-hop it. Put your hawk in the sky. Move side to side. Jump to the left. Stick it, glide. Zig-zag. Across the floor. Shuffle in diagonal. Hit the drum. Hands on your hips. Do a one-footed 180° twist. Zig-zag, step and slide. Lean it left. Clap three times. Shake it out, head to toe. Throw it all together, that's how we roll. Keep repeating the moves.
Think of something interesting and draw it on to a piece of paper. Don't worry about coloring or shading it -- you'll be cutting it out and using the rest of it as a stencil.          Keep it simple at first. Geometrical shapes and circles in an uneven pattern are easiest and never cliché. Space them far enough apart if you're a beginner -- you don't want the paper to tear when being cut.; , Keep the surrounding blank paper in tact. You have now made your stencil. Unfortunately, if it rips, you'll probably need to start over. Exercise care and precision.          Make sure your stencil fits appropriately on your shirt. If it doesn't, you'll have to resize or otherwise adjust it.  Place the stencil so the mesh is directly on top (the two should be touching) and the handles are facing up. If there is space between the edges of your stencil and the edges of your screen, put masking tape on the underside. You don't want paint leaking where it shouldn't leak.          If you use the taping method, make sure not to tape the stencil to the mesh! Otherwise the stencil might move around when you're squeegee-ing it.  Make a line at the top of the screen (the part furthest away from you). You don't want paint on top of the stencil at the moment. Try to spoon out as much paint as you think would cover the stencil.          It's a little difficult to use more than one color with this method. If you do try it, know that at some point or other, the colors will mix. If you're okay with that, go for it!  , Try to do it with one downwards movement -- or the least number of strokes possible. This makes it look as smooth and professional as can be.          Always, always, always, make vertical strokes. If you make both horizontal and vertical strokes, the paint will clump and be harder to dry and finish. Once you reach the bottom, keep going and scoop the excess paint up the handle to be reused.  Be careful! If you drag it at all, the paint may smear. It's best to do it layer by layer, lifting up and then off.          Leave to dry. The longer, the better.  If you printed onto clothing, then once it is dry you need to put a sheet of greasing or tracing paper over your design and iron it. This seals it, making it wearable and washable.	Design your print. Use a craft knife to cut out all the coloured parts of your design. Put your stencil on top of your material (paper or t-shirt) and the screen on top of the stencil. Spoon out some paint. Use the squeegee to spread the paint over the mesh. Lift everything up off your material.
A three-way switch allows you to control one appliance from two or more locations.   The switch may have either screw terminal connectors, which will be located along the side of the switch, or push-in connector holes, which will be located at the back of the switch.  A three-way switch requires three wires: a hot wire, a neutral wire, and a traveler wire. The switch will also have a green or bare copper grounding wire. The box may contain one or two cables, or sets of wires.   Mark the wire connected to the colored screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the colored screw terminal (it will typically be a dark color and will not be green) as the “common” wire. Mark the two wires connected to the other two screw terminals as the “traveler” wires. Mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch) as the “grounding” wire.    If the wires are connected to screw terminals, turn each screw counter-clockwise with a screwdriver to loosen and slide the wire out with a pair of needle-nose pliers. If the wires are connected to push-in connectors, the holes that the wires are pushed into will typically have a small slot beneath the hole. Insert a small screwdriver into the slot and push forward to release the wire.    Connect the black (common) wire to the common screw terminal, which you can identify because it will be a different color than the other two terminals (and not green). If the box contains two cables or sets of wires, you will attach the traveler wires (typically black and red) to the remaining two screw terminals. Either: A) Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw and then tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire. Or B) push the wire into the push-in hole on the same side of the switch as the colored screw. If the box contains one cable or set of wires, you will attach the traveler wires (typically white and red) to the remaining two screw terminals. Either: A) Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw and then tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire. Or B) push the wire into the push-in hole on the same side of the switch as the colored screw.  You should see the word “top” written on the switch indicating the side of the switch that should be vertically oriented toward the top. , Do not over tighten the switch plate, since it may crack under too much pressure.  Go back to the new switch and flip it on and off several times to ensure it’s in working order.	Make a written note or take a picture of how each wire is connected to the switch. Identify and mark each wire. Disconnect the wires from the old switch. Connect the wires to the new switch. Double-check that the switch is properly oriented. Carefully push the wires back into the box and then push the switch up against the edge of the box and tighten the mounting screws into place.  , Replace the switch plate and tighten the screws into place. Return to the breaker box and turn the power to the light switch back on.
For many pennies, one tablespoon (15 g) of salt in 1/2 cup (4 oz) of vinegar will get the job done. Stir the mixture to dissolve the salt.          If you don't have vinegar, use lemon or even orange juice. Copper oxide (the gunk on your pennies) dissolves in weak acid, and that's just what all three of these liquids are.; , Make sure they are not directly on top of each other.  If they're extra dirty or if you're cleaning a lot simultaneously, give them a few more minutes for good measure.          For those especially nasty pennies, scrub them with a scrubber or toothbrush after they've been resting in the solution for a bit.  Let them dry for around five minutes so they will no longer be wet. They will now sparkle.          If you don't wash them off, a blue-green sheen will develop on your pennies. That's what happens when the copper, oxygen, and chlorine (from the salt) combine (called malachite).	Put 1 tsp (5 g) of salt into 1/4 c (2 oz) of vinegar. Place your pennies in the vinegar or the lemon juice. Leave the pennies for around five minutes in the glass of vinegar or lemon juice. Take the pennies out, and wash them off.
Size makes no difference but be prepared to use an increased number of nails and thread for a larger size.  Sand the top of the board to remove loose pieces of wood and then smooth over with a soft brush. You’ll want the board to be as smooth as possible, without any jagged edges.        Spray paint the board surface. Perform this task in a well ventilated area that has been protected with a drop cloth or newsprint. Consider adding two coats to give a professional, polished appearance.       Allow for ample dry time before continuing with the craft.      ; , You will border the entire board with nails that are evenly spaced between each other. Use a pencil to mark your spaces or simply tap a nail lightly into place to create your guide.  Tap nails into place without going completely through the board, but enough to securely hold to the surface. You want enough of the nail and head protruding away from the board so you can tie the string and wind it around the nail.  Make sure you double knot the string so it stays in place.  Continue the pattern by stretching string to the opposite corner of the board and winding the string about the nail two times.  Look for the opposing corner and stretch the string to the opposing end nail and wind twice.       You will be making an “X” shape each time you wind the string.  This may take some time, especially if you chose a large board so if you want to take a break, simply wind the string around the last nail several times to hold in place until you return.  You want a spiral, starburst shape so you may need to adjust strings at this point.	Prepare your base by obtaining a flat wooden board of your choice. Measure the board sides to determine nail placement. Add nails to the board. Tie the string to one corner of the board. Stretch string to the opposing end of the board and wind around the nail twice. Move onto the next nail and repeat the process until all nails contain wound string. Tie off the final piece of string and pull strings into place. Finished.
Small bathrooms tend to have limited floor space, but what about the unused area above the toilet or next to the window? If your bathroom has a spot on the wall that isn't getting much use, consider installing some sturdy shelves where you can store towels, extra shampoo and soap, or small decorations.   Be sure to place the shelving above your head level - you don't want to be bumping your forehead each time you step out of the shower. If you have a free corner, choose corner shelves to maximize space even more.       If your bathroom seems too small for shelves, install some hooks instead. Choose a style that matches the décor of your bathroom and hang three or four in a row on the wall. Use them to hang your towels, loofah, body brush, or other bathroom equipment., The shower itself can be a storage area and a place to decorate. Hang a cute wire shower caddy over the shower head and store your shampoo and conditioner there. You could also look into installing waterproof shelving inside the shower to hold these items.  If you have a cabinet under your sink, there's no need to have an extra dresser in another corner of the bathroom. Clear away decorative tables, laundry hampers (they can go in your bedroom instead) and any other piece of furniture that sits on the floor of your bathroom. You'll be amazed at what a difference clearing away even a small piece of furniture can make.   If you absolutely must keep a dresser or small piece of furniture in your bathroom, try to maximize space by creating a second level of usage. For example, a small dresser can double as a vanity if you hang a mirror on the wall above it.       If you have a large clothes hamper that you prefer to keep in the bathroom, consider getting a cloth laundry bag instead. These take up much less space than large basket hampers.  If you're prepared to spend some money to decorate your small bathroom, you may want to look into getting a smaller bathtub, or converting your bathtub to a shower that takes up less space. You could also get a a smaller sink fixture to replace one that is large and bulky.	Add functional shelving. Get a shower caddy. Remove unnecessary furniture and floor cabinets. Replace large bathroom fixtures with smaller ones.
You can dance dabke to any music, as long as it has a consistent recognizable rhythm. Songs with a faster pace work best for this high-energy dance.   Traditional dabke music is performed live using a combination of instruments that usually include hand drums, woodwinds, and the oud. The band may play well-known songs or improvise, sometimes blending the two together. A vocalist also typically performs, singing songs that tell a story or are in some way significant to the event being held. Modern dabke can be done to either live music or a recording. Newer dabke music often blends traditional instruments with electronic beats. Some popular dabke artists make their music entirely digitally.Vocalists are less common in modern dabke music, with many popular songs having only a small singing part with some completely instrumental.Even just a large group clapping can be danced to. Clapping can also be used in addition to music to help dancers keep rhythm and as a way for non-dancers to join in.; , Stand up straight, holding your neighbors' hands. Keep your feet spaced slightly apart with your left foot slightly in front. Try to line your feet up in parallel with your partners'., Swing your left foot towards your right side. Cross over your right foot with your left to take a step. At this point your legs should now be crossed., Step further to the right with your right foot. Uncross your legs by moving your right foot one step to the right. You should now be standing a few feet from where you were at the beginning of the dance but in the exact same position., Repeat the steps you just took. Cross your left leg in front of your right. Follow up by taking a step to the right. This whole sequence is called a "cross-over"and is the basic step of the dabke. Cross-overs may be done many times between other moves. Over the course of the dance, the chain may reverse directions. To accomplish this, simply switch your sides so that your right foot faces towards the front and crosses over your left leg.  Swing your foot into a "low kick." Your leg should be straight and form a roughly 45 degree angle to your right leg and the rest of your body. Keep your toes facing either forward or angled up rather than pointing towards the ground., Take your leg from a "low kick" to a "raise." Simply bend your knee and bring your thigh up as high as you can get it. Your left leg should now be at a nearly 90 degree angle compared to the rest of your body. Your knee should point slightly downward.  Bring your left foot back flat on the ground by straightening your leg and focusing your weight forward slightly. After you stomp down, you should once again be in your starting position.   As dabke literally means "to stomp,"this step is often considered the most important part of the dance., Dabke is a very energetic, fast-paced dance. You and your partners should perform these steps as quickly as the music demands. Cross-overs, kicks, and stomps should each be done as fluidly as possible without a major pause in movement.   While dabke is generally made up of these two main steps, many dancers incorporate a variety of different types of jumps and footwork.  In most styles of dabke, the chain of dancers is led by one person as its "raas" (meaning "head") or lawweeh (meaning "waver"). He or she decides what moves to do and where the chain will go. Some dabke leaders may position themselves at the end of the chain itself,while others dance in an unlinked separate position between the chain and an audience.   Watch your lead and try to mimic him or her while in sync with the other dancers. Because of their relatively free position, leads may perform certain moves, such as spins or flips, that are impossible for linked dancers to do. The other dancers are not generally expected to repeat these.  Once you've practiced enough and grown confident in your dabke skills, you may ask to take a turn as the leader. Immerse yourself in the music. As the song goes on, make decisions on what moves will look the best together and feel most natural to the dancers you are leading.  The occasional synchronized jump or kick adds variation to the dabke. Use them to punctuate every few step cycles. Kick your legs forward. Hop backwards, forwards, or to the side.  If you aren't dancing in a circle, switching directions will be necessary every time you reach the end of the dance floor. However, you may choose to switch directions more often or turn the line instead. Try to make these changes regularly after a certain time or number of step cycles.  Splitting a long dabke chain into much smaller ones for a time is another popular move, especially for choreographed dabke teams. These smaller lines can then dance against each other to create beautiful patterns.   Splitting may also be done to spotlight solo dancers.Two almost opposite moves are to move the chain inward to form a semicircle or join the ends for a temporary complete circle.  You will need at least three people for dabke, but the dance works best with five or more. There is no limit to how many people can join in on a single dabke dance. In fact, the world record for the biggest dabke dance consisted of 5,050 dancers.Get as many people to dabke as you have room for.   To gather a dabke group, ask family members and friends if they would like to start one. Some events may have a specific time to dabke planned. If you're curious about when it starts, what kind of music will be playing, or who can join in, try asking the host. You could also put together a dabke team beforehand and ask to perform at the event.  Usually someone will volunteer to lead, but if you know someone is particularly talented, you can try asking him or her personally. Ultimately, anyone who knows the basics of dabke can lead, no matter the person's age, gender, or skill-level., An important aspect of dabke is that it symbolizes harmony and togetherness. To do this, the dancers physically link themselves together.Dancers may hold hands, place arms over each other's shoulders, or switch between the two over the course of the dance. A dabke chain can be a straight line,a semicircle,or lack a defined shape altogether.  Try to make sure that you and the other dancers are exactly in sync with each other. The more people who stay in perfect time, the more impressive your dabke will look. In addition to looking great, the coordinated moves further drive home the importance of community in dabke.	Find the right music. Begin at your starting position. Step to the right with your left foot. Return to your starting position. Move another length to the right. Kick your left foot forward. Raise your left leg higher. Stomp down hard on the ground. Repeat these steps as quickly as you can. Follow the leader. Take a turn at the lead. Hop and jump. Change directions. Split the line. Get a group together on the dance floor. Figure out who should take the lead. Form a chain. Synchronize your moves.
The first step in any septic installation is to perform a site survey and do a percolation (soil) test on the area where the POWTS is going to be installed. The system then can be designed based on the findings of the survey and results of the soil test. After this, the appropriate permits and approvals can be applied for.   Site survey findings that influence the design include things like:  available space topography intended purpose and perceived water use based on the size of the dwelling/building the system will service.   location of the well and/or neighboring wells. Soil test findings that influence the design include things like:  soil type and layering (sand, clay, rock, and where it is located relative to depth) ability of the soil to drain and filter wastewater.  Upon receipt of the necessary permits and approvals, the system can be installed. Be sure to perform the following procedures in compliance with any and all laws and applicable plumbing and building codes.	Prepare and design your system. Wait for approval.
You will want to wear clothes that will not restrict your movements or blood flow. Don’t wear clothes which are too tight, especially around your joints. You will also want to wear clothing which is made of a material which breathes well, since you will sweat when doing many forms of exercise. Clothes specifically designed for exercise can easily be found.; , Just because we call them tennis shoes does not mean they are great athletic shoes. Shoes like Converse have little shock absorbency and can be terrible for your feet and bones. Get shoes which fit comfortably and are designed for the type of activity that you intend to do.  Drink lots of water before you exercise. Your body will need the water to help your muscles work and also to help you sweat. If you’re dehydrated before you start, just think about how you’ll feel afterwards!  , Don’t stretch before exercising. Contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that this is not helpful and will not allow you to perform any better. If anything, stretching before exercising will make you worse off: it’s a great way to pull or strain a muscle and hurt yourself!  , Though researchers cannot agree definitively on whether or not warm ups help you to perform better in exercises, they all agree that warming up certainly won’t hurt.Warm up before exercising by doing a less intense version of your intended workout for 5-10 minutes. If you plan to run, jog first. If you intend to swim, swim slowly.  Certain conditions may make it a good idea to check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen. There are exercises for every health condition, but it’s a good idea to know what to avoid. Exercising should make you feel healthy and good in your own body: not hurt you!   If you have diseases or conditions like asthma or lung problems, arthritis, diabetes or liver and kidney problems, or heart disease, definitely talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.If you notice certain problems, you will also want to talk to a doctor. These include things like pain or dizziness following physical exertion, shortness of breath after very mild exertion or when at rest, or swelling in the ankles. You may also want to talk to a doctor simply to find out what kind of exercise they recommend for your particular goals and health conditions. You can also consult with a nutritionist and a trainer for more information on exercising and how you can best meet your goals.  Aerobic exercise is often called a “cardio” workout, since it is designed to increase and improve blood flow. These types of exercises are of a lower intensity but last for longer periods of time.  Climbing stairs is a great way to get your heart rate up. You can climb actual stairs or you can use a stair machine at a gym. Climbing stairs improves your leg muscles as well as your butt. Be careful if using actual stairs, however, as you do not want to fall and get seriously injured.   , This is not just a fun game for children but also an excellent workout. Working the arms, legs and core muscles, this is an exercise that you can easily do at home. It is also well known for improving balance and is excellent for people who intend to play sports.  Jumping jacks are an exercise performed by standing with the legs together, arms at your side, and then jumping to move the legs outward and raising the arm together above your head. Jump again to return to the starting position. These are great for getting your heart rate up and burning calories.  Walking and jogging are wonderful ways to get your heart rate up. Though jogging may be difficult on the knees for some people, walking is certainly an accessible exercise and should be done by those at every level. Studies have shown that walking an hour a day can help you maintain your weight over time and reduce your likelihood of certain conditions, like hypertension and obesity. , Swimming is great exercise and is fun to boot. This will work different muscles depending on the style of swimming you do. Swimming is frequently recommended for people with joint problems or those that are significantly overweight, as it can take a great deal of strain off of the skeleton while still raising the heart rate.  Riding your bike is an accessible, environmentally friendly, and very effective way to get exercise. Working muscles in most areas of the body, bike riding will get your heart rate up while it gets you somewhere! You can bike outside or you can get a stationary bike and stay at home.  Anaerobic exercises are those done at a higher intensity for shorter periods of time. These build strength and help your body to become accommodated to working hard. Paired with a healthy diet, these exercises can also help you to lose weight, as your body’s caloric use will increase. These types of exercise are actually arguably better for burning fat than aerobic exercises. , Running is tough on the knees and bone structure but is still an excellent form of exercise. You can run locally around your neighborhood or around a track at a gym. Remember that running is different than jogging: it’s much faster and much harder to do!  , There are many different types of weights you can lift and ways to lift them, but doing this type of exercise will help you build a variety of muscles and increase your strength. Be sure to start small and work your way up, since trying to lift something which is too heavy is a common way to injure yourself.  Push ups are done by placing yourself with your stomach on the ground. Place your feet so that your toes are flat on the ground, then place your hands flat on the ground at face level, a shoulder’s width apart. Then, keeping the line of your back and legs completely straight, lift your body with your arms by pushing against the ground so that your whole body is supported on your toes and hands. Lower yourself back down so that your nose is nearly touching the ground and then raise yourself back up. Repeat.  Squats are done by standing with your feet a shoulder’s width apart, back straight, arms crossed in front of you, and slowly lowering yourself down as if to sit in a chair. Once in the sitting position, slowly raise yourself back up. These are a great exercise for your core and leg muscles.  Burpees (a common military exercise) are done starting in a standing position, then drop to a crouch, jump the legs back into push-up position, do one push-up (if you want), hop your legs back to the crouch position, and then jump straight upwards with hands raised to return to the standing position. This is a great workout as it exercises all areas of the body.  Core workouts develop the muscles around your abdomen. This has many benefits. With a stronger core, you will be less prone to back pain and injury and you will also be able to improve bad posture. Paired with weight loss, strong core muscles will also give you defined abs.  Planks are probably the most efficient core exercise. You can greatly improve your core strength with just a few minutes of this exercise every day. Planks are done by taking a position similar to a push up, but supporting the upper half of your body on your forearms and holding the position for as long as possible. It will surprise you how difficult it is if you’ve never tried it but the exercise is extremely effective.  Crunches are another great core exercise, done by lying face up, knees bent, arms crossed at your chest, and lifting just the head and shoulder up towards the pelvis. Lower yourself back down and repeat.  Sit ups are similar to crunches and are done by lying face up, knees bent only slightly, and rolling your upper body into a sitting position. You can cross your arms in front of you or run your palms up and down your thighs as you move to guide your movement.  Bridges are a great core exercise because they also work on your bottom and lower back muscles. These are done by lying on your back, with your knees bent and your arms flat on the ground at your sides. Slowly roll your back and lift your hips until a straight line is created between your shoulders and knees, your back and thighs parallel, and then slowly lower it back into starting position.  T’ai chi is a Chinese martial art, the forms of which are done in sequences of slow movements. Doing t’ai chi will allow you to build better balance but it can also be very relaxing. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.  Weight shifts are a great starting balancing exercise. These are done by standing with both feet on the ground, hip width apart. Next, shift all of your weight onto one leg and lift the other slightly off of the floor. Hold the position, trying to maintain good form, for 30 seconds. Do the other leg. Repeat as much as you want. , These are done same as the above, with the exception that the lifted leg is bent backwards at the knee. This will work on your front-to-back balance, whereas the previous one focuses more on side-to-side. Both should be used in conjunction.  Pilates is a series of forms and movements which occasionally makes use of tools like exercise balls, weights, and resistance bands. This form of exercise helps train muscles with the correct movement patterns which can improve balance, core strength, posture and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.  Yoga is an Indian meditation technique and exercise which has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety (in turn aiding weight loss) and is excellent for building better balance and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.  Various forms of dance, such as ballet, are actually fairly rigorous exercise and can significantly improve your flexibility, as well as your coordination. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center.  Stretches should be done after warming up or exercising, as this will help prevent muscle strain and injury. Stretching your muscles will help provide much greater flexibility and can reduce the likelihood of injury due to strain during other exercises later on.A basic stretch to try is a hamstring stretch. This is done by sitting, splaying your legs apart, and reaching forward to touch one foot at a time. You can bend the leg which is not being reached across. Another basic stretch is a butterfly groin stretch. This is done by sitting on the floor and pulling both ankles in towards your crotch, getting as close as you can. Try to press your knees to the floor as you do this. Try a simple shoulder stretch. This is done by pulling your elbow across the front of your body towards the opposite shoulder. Press against your arm as you do this. This wall stretch aids mobility in the chest, shoulders, abs, hip flexors, quads and calves. Face a wall standing about a foot away from it, then reach your hands up as high as you can flat against the wall, leaning forward into it with your chest and hips while keeping your feet in position flat on the floor.  You don’t have to dedicate hours of your day to exercising. Anything helps, so find ways to fit exercise into the smaller “in between” moments of your day. You can do squats while you wait for food to cook or microwave or fit in a minute of planks when you first wake up. Look and you will find moments in your day to get a little more active.  If you spend most of your day sitting in a desk chair, you will find you have a lot to gain from finding an alternative. Using a standing desk or a standing desk in combination with a treadmill will get you burning calories while you work (it doesn’t even have to be fast paced, though the harder it is the more you’ll get out of it). If that’s not for you, try an exercise ball instead of a desk chair. Some research has found that using these methods can help you lose over 40 lbs a year if you’re overweight. , When getting to your apartment or office, skip the elevator and take the stairs instead. This is great because you can add a floor at a time as it becomes easier for you to get up the stairs. Eventually you can also run up the stairs for some added exercise.  Whenever you can, stop using your car if it is possible for you to get yourself where you’re going on foot or on a bike. Turn grocery shopping into a workout by walking to the store a few times a week to pick up a smaller number of items. Take a bus to work and get off a few stops early to walk. Ride your bike to work if you can. If you have to take your car, park really far away from your building. This is a great way to introduce physical activity into your day. , This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.  If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a few seconds, and then return.  If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  Sit in a chair, stand up and repeat. You can try doing these squats without the chair if you have the strength and balance to do so., This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.  If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for 30 seconds, and then return.  If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets., This can be broken up into three 5 minute sets.  This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.  If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  At this point you need to work in variations like the side plank and reverse plank as well. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a minute, and then return., You will want to choose weights and positions based on the muscle groups you wish to focus on. Break up the hour into three 20 minute sets and try to work different muscle groups in each set., This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.  Interval training is any exercise done at a very high intensity for only a few brief minutes (2-3 at most) and alternated with either no activity or a slow paced activity. Interval training is widely regarded to be one of the most effective exercise regimens, since it is less time consuming but appears to produce identical effects., The most basic interval training routine would be to sprint for 2-3 blocks (or the equivalent of 400 meters) and then walk back to the starting point, beginning the process over again.   An alternative would be to combine this with an aerobic workout. Warm up by walking slowly for five minutes, quickly for ten minutes, sprint for three blocks, walk back two block, sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks (and so on, lasting 15 minutes), and then walking back quickly to your origin point to cool down.  You can apply interval training to almost any exercise activity. Try cycling, swimming, many core exercises, and so on. Try to alternate between exercise activities on different days to ensure that all of your muscle groups get attention.  You will want to set your goal for exercising at least ½ an hour a day. Slowly, over time, you should draw this out to 1 hour. This time period, however, can be broken up into sections and spread over the course of the day, however, those sections should be no less than 10 minutes. When you begin, exercise at least 2 days a week. Over time you should increase your frequency up to 5 days a week., Walking is the best thing you can do for improving your health. As discussed above, a study found that a mixture of intense and relaxed walking in senior citizens decreased the likelihood of certain diseases by 20%. You can walk with your friends, family members, or by yourself. If you want to walk in the comfort of indoors, you can walk around the inside of your apartment building or you can walk the inner corridor of the local mall. You can also walk outside if you prefer.   Try to walk for at least half an hour a day and go at a pace that gets your heart rate up. If you do not push your body at least a little, you will not gain nearly as much from the exercise.  As we age, we tend to lose a lot of our balance. This is normal. However, you will want to work on your balance to help ensure that you can move around without hurting yourself. Do balance exercises to protect yourself and prevent injury.A good, basic balance exercise is to try standing on one leg. Make sure to do both legs in turn and to also have a chair nearby to hold on to if necessary to prevent falling.  Muscles lose their elasticity over time, which can make it difficult for you to move around or get up if you fall. Do flexibility exercises like stretches to maintain your muscles and keep you safe and independent. , Lift small, 2lb weights (more if you can). This will help you maintain the strength in your hands and arms, allowing you greater independence for longer.  Cool down exercises, like warm up exercises, are a gentler exercise, meant to ease your body between working hard and being at rest. Cool down by walking for 5-10 minutes and (preferably) stretching. Stretching before exercising is likely to cause injury but stretching after exercise, when the muscles are warm and active, will help improve their tone and flexibility., When you exercise, your muscles use up and your body sweats out a number of essential nutrients. You need to replace these nutrients or you can hurt yourself or become sick. These nutrients, water, sodium, potassium, and sugar, can be consumed in a number of ways. You could try drinking water and eating a banana or drinking water and eating a protein bar, among a variety of other options. If you choose to drink a sports drink, it is best to dilute the drink at a ration of 6 to 1 (that is 6 parts water for each part drink) since these drink's sugar content is unnecessarily high.  Exercising, especially the kind that pushes your body beyond its comfort level (the good kind!), can cause muscle pain and discomfort. This is normal and a healthy sign of your body getting into shape and becoming stronger. You may want to manage the pain though. This can be done by taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen or using an ice pack.Intense pain with a fast onset is an indication that you have injured yourself. Consult with a doctor or nurse, especially if it is very severe or lasts for more than a few days. Prevent muscle pain to begin with by slowly easing into exercise, both in an individual routine but also over the course of time. Don’t leap straight into a high intensity program but rather build yourself up to that level over the course of several months.	Wear the right clothes. Wear the right shoes. Hydrate.

Some homes may have 1 large main breaker box as well as smaller branch breaker boxes.; , A tripped breaker is halfway between the on and off position.   Before assuming a circuit breaker needs to be replaced, try resetting the breaker by turning off all lights and unplugging all devices on that circuit. Then turn the back to the on position. Some breakers must be turned all the way off before they can be turned back on. Test the circuit breaker by turning on the breaker, and then add the devices 1 at a time. If the light or device becomes operable, then a voltage tester is not needed. ,   This should be the large flip switch located above or below all the other smaller ones. It should also be labeled "main" or something similar. The main breaker typically has the largest amperage rating of all the breakers in the panel. , If there is evidence of rust, charring, discoloration, moisture, or other contamination, DO NOT proceed, and call an electrician immediately., The safety of these panels is highly debated. Research the issue, and contact an experienced electrician for advise. Decide what to do based upon the information you find., Wear insulated lineman's gloves and use insulated lineman's tools. Wear rubber-soled shoes and safety glasses, and stand on a rubber mat., If there is water or another liquid present, do not proceed. Call a licensed electrician immediately. Also, be sure that there is plenty of clearance above, below, to the sides of, and in front of the panel., Use the left hand rule when opening the panel to prevent injury in the event of an arc flash. , Look for signs of rust, moisture intrusion, pest intrusion, loose wires, melting, discoloration, charring, heat marking, multiple wires under one screw, aluminum wiring, wiring with damaged insulation, knob and tube wiring, strange modifications, debris, and multiple colored wires connected to each other. If ANY of these conditions are found, or if another type of strange thing is found, do not proceed. Call a licensed, competent, and insured electrician.,,,, The replacement breaker must have the same amperage and be the same type (unless using "classified" breakers) as the previous breaker. Snap the circuit breaker back into the same place as the old on the panel. , Do not over tighten, but do not leave too loose either.  If any of the original screws were lost, replace them with FLAT-ENDED MACHINE SCREWS. Using pointed wood screws may damage wiring inside the panel.	Find the main circuit breaker box. Locate the defective breaker. Use a voltage tester to see if power is going out through the wire attached to the breaker.  , Turn off the branch breaker boxes, followed by the main power. Turn off the individual breakers.  , Inspect the exterior of the panel. Beware of certain types of panels, specifically those bearing one of the following names: Federal Pacific Electric, Federal Pioneer, Zinsco, Kearney, GTE Sylvania, or Stab-lok. Use protective equipment. Be sure the area around you is safe. Remove the screws holding the face plate (called a "dead front") with a Philips screwdriver. Read the label on the main power switch to determine what kind of circuit breaker box you own.  , Inspect (without touching anything) the interior of the panel. Loosen the screws that hold the wires found on the defective breaker.  , Remove the breaker from the panel.  , Discard the old circuit breaker.  , Replace the old circuit breaker with the new one. Place the wires in the new circuit breaker as they were in the old one.  , Tighten the screws. Replace the circuit panel's faceplate. Turn on the main power, followed by the individual breakers.
Park brake cables sometimes become corroded or get dirt and grim in them. If this happens, it can cause your brake to get stuck and not function properly. Your best option is to replace the cable., It is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands., Consult your service manual to see which wheels are held by the park brake. If any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps, use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them., It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs., Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the car up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the car are:  Your owner’s manual will recommend jacking points The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack. You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. If you have access to a hydraulic lift, it will save you time.  At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. Place wheels under the car as back-up protection in case the jack stands fail., This cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub. This will expose the retaining nut., There will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening (referred to as a cotter pin). Remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver., Using a wrench or ratchet, turn the nut counter-clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. If the nut is stuck, lubricate it with WD-40 or similar lubricant., Some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub. If this is the case, you will need to remove those bolts. , Pull the drum straight off of the hub. You may have to wiggle a little to get it started. If the drum appears stuck and will not pull off, you should:  Check to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed. Check to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes., This step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes. You will need to look on the back side of the backing plate (the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted) for a small rubber plug. Removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes.  The adjuster is designed to self-adjust the shoes into a tightened position, so loosening them may be tricky. If the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust, you are going in the wrong direction. Once the shoes are retracted, you can remove the drum and continue.	Purchase a replacement cable from a local parts dealer. Pull the car onto level, solid ground. Remove hubcaps from the wheels you will be working on. Loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench (tire iron) or impact wrench. Jack up the car. Remove the wheels. Remove the grease dust cap. Pull out the cotter pin. Remove the retaining nut. Inspect the drum. Attempt remove the drum. Retract the brake shoes.
The perfect size for an embroidery hoop is about 23 inches (58 cm) and the hoops can be found at any local store that sells crafts. Take the hoop apart and place its hardware pieces in a baggie to keep them from getting lost while you put the canopy together., Be sure that the casing seam at the top of your curtains are facing the hoop on its inside. Slide all six of the curtain panels around the circumference of the hoop., Clamp the two ends of the embroidery hoop together by inserting the hardware pieces you previously placed in the baggie. Slide curtains over the hoop’s closure and make sure that the curtains are distributed evenly around the circumference of the hoop., Cut three pieces of ribbon at about 4” long so that the hoop can hang a good distance away from the ceiling. If you want the canopy to hang down even lower from the ceiling, cut the ribbon pieces a little longer.Spread the curtains and loop the ribbons around the sides of the hoop. The ribbons should be looped onto the hoop every couple of panels so that the curtains are even on each side and the access points are more plainly seen.Tie the ribbons together at the top into a knot.  Hooks are available at most home improvement stores. Hang the knotted ribbon and your canopy curtains over the hook in the ceiling. Spread two of the panels to create a door.Add pillows to your finished canopy or stuffed animals to give the reading nook some personality. These reading nooks can also act as a tent around small arm chairs in children rooms and nurseries and can be the perfect place to read to your child while they’re in your lap.	Start crafting the canopy nook by taking apart the embroidery hoop. Slide the curtain fabric onto the embroidery hoop. Secure the hoop back together. Prepare the ribbons that will hang the canopy. Hang a hook from the ceiling and use it to hang the canopy on.

There are often notices in local newspapers about upcoming concerts as well. Consult your schedule and make sure you’ll be available on that date.   If you need to travel to get to the venue, clear your schedule for the length of time it will take to get there, attend the concert, and return home. If you’re under the care of parents or guardians, make sure they will let you go to the concert before you try to get tickets. Other people who enjoy the same bands will be trying to buy or win tickets, too. You wouldn’t want to hurt someone else’s chances of getting seats to the show if you end up not being able to attend the concert.; , Artists will often announce tours on social media or their websites first.Go to the artist’s website and sign up for their electronic mailing list.Follow the performer’s profiles on social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. You can usually find links to their official social media pages directly from the band’s official website.   Use social media apps that will give you real time alerts on your mobile device when the band you’re following posts something. For example, Snapchat, Twitter, or Instagram. If the band’s website has a blog with an RSS feed, you can use an app like Boxcar, Newsify or RSS Bot to get notifications as soon as their blog posts an update.  Some credit card companies offer presale tickets deals to their cardholders, and will send out emails about upcoming concerts before the general public even knows about them. Check the website of credit card companies you are a cardholder with or call their customer service number on the back of your card. If they do offer such promotions, sign up for their email list to be notified about special offers.   Try asking, “Do you offer presale deals on concert tickets to your card members?” If the answer is yes, you can ask something like, “How can I submit my email address to be notified about those types of offers?” The representative may guide you through the process or offer to sign you up right over the phone. For example, American Express, Citibank and MasterCard all have special ticket offers for cardholders.  Check the artist’s website a few months before the event and look for requests for volunteers. If you apply as a volunteer and are accepted, you will get free access to the show. You can also check with the venue itself to see if they need volunteers.

Then when the tickets go on sale, you can attempt to buy them right away.Sign up for their mailing list to get notifications ahead of time. If the website has an app for ticket sales, install it on one of your devices. This can give you real time information on ticket availability. Also, you may be able to bypass potential problems with their website loading on the day tickets go on sale. Practice purchasing tickets ahead of time (for any event) on the website without completing the process. Then you will be familiar with the process so that you are prepared to do it quickly when the tickets you want go on sale. Make sure to remove the test item from your cart afterwards.  If you know where the venue is going to be, go on their website and view their seating chart. Print it out or save a copy it for easy access. You don’t want to make a mistake by purchasing tickets to seats in a different area than you thought they were.During the public sale, tickets sometimes sell out very quickly. Having a seating chart for easy reference when ticket shopping can save you precious time.  You can monitor the internet for new content about the artist whose concert you wish to attend. Use a service like Google Alerts or IFTTT (“If This, Then That”). Then if there are news articles or blog posts about ticket sales or giveaways, you’ll be notified by email.   For example, specify that you want to be notified of all new results that include the artist’s name and the keyword “tickets.”	Make sure you’re available. Follow band webpages. Sign up for email alerts as a credit card holder. Volunteer your services. Register for the ticket distributor’s website. Familiarize yourself with the venue’s layout. Sign up for news alerts.
Memorize it and the pattern.; , The best way to do this is to construct a scale using the notes you used, and ascend with notes that sound "nice". This will become easier with experience.  In general, major keys will sound happy and upbeat, while minor keys will sound sad (although this is not a hard and fast rule, a minor key can certainly sound happy). Also, metal songs will generally use minor keys.  Ex: Your riff uses the notes Eb, F, Ab, and D. You determine the other notes to be C, G, and Bb. You know now that your riff is in either Eb Major, or C Minor. You decide to use C Minor.  Ex: You write C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, and C. Under the first C, you write "I", under the D you write "II", under the Eb you write "III", and so on until you reach the second C, where you put "I" once again.  Thirds are the most common, as they usually sound the best, and are the easiest, however sixths and fourths can also sound very good, and even a second or seventh can sound good, used sparingly.  Ex: You decided to harmonize in thirds, so you write Eb under the first C, F under the D, and so on.	Create a riff. Determine what notes you are using, and try to figure out what scale you are using. Decide whether you're using a major, or minor key. Use the scale constructed in step 2 to determine the key your riff is in. Write down the notes of your scale, and write the scale intervals (Roman numerals) underneath each in order. Decide what interval you want to harmonize in. Using the list you wrote in step five, write the notes down again, adjusting them for the interval you chose. Using this finished list, play the riff again, playing the notes that are underneath the original notes.

You don’t want to plant marigold seeds too early. Wait until early spring is over, and the danger of a spring frost has passed. During mid or late spring, you can begin readying the soil for planting your marigolds., Marigolds grow best in loamy, well-drained soil that water can travel through relatively easily. Sandy soil that traps water can stunt the growth of the plant.To test whether the garden soil is optimal for planting, dig a 12x12 inch hole that is about 18 inches (46 cm) deep. Fill it with water and let it drain, and then do it again and time how long it takes the water to drain. The water level in well-drained soil goes down about one inch per hour., Before planting marigolds outside, you will want to weed the site you will be planting on. Also make sure to clear away any rocks or debris. This makes the site more hospitable to the marigold plants so that they can grow without interference.When you are weeding, grip the weed as close to the soil as you can. You want to try to remove the entire root section of the weed as well as the part above the ground, or else the weed will grow back.  Before you plant marigolds, mix some organic compost or well-aged manure into the garden soil. This will improve the health of the marigolds by giving them the nutrients they need to thrive., You want to make sure that the soil is warm on the day that you are planting the marigold seeds. Cool or cold soil can affect the growing process., Use a trowel or shovel to dig into the soil 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm). Turn the soil over to break it up and to make it airy. Do this for the entire area in which you will be planting the seeds.As you are turning over the soil, make sure to break up any clumps and remove any rocks or pebbles you find.  After you have prepared the soil, drop the marigold seeds in the soil a few inches apart from each other. You don’t want to plant them too close to each other or they could interfere with each other's growth., Use ¼ inch of soil to cover the marigold seeds. This will ensure that the seeds aren’t too exposed and will be able to grow. Do not use too much soil to cover the seeds; this will make it difficult for the fragile seedlings to poke out of the ground.	Wait until spring to start the planting process. Make sure the soil of the area isn’t too sandy or dry. Weed and clear the area. Lay down compost or manure. Plant the seeds on a warm day. Dig about 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) into the soil. Sow them in the ground a few inches apart from each other. Cover the seeds with ¼ inch of soil.
You can purchase a replacement belt from your local auto parts store. Make sure to provide them with the exact year, make and model of the vehicle as well as engine size so you receive the correct replacement belt.It is recommended that you use an EPDM style belt to replace your old one. Compare your new belt to the old one to ensure the new belt is the proper length and width.  If your vehicle came equipped with an auto tensioner pulley, it can usually be loosened by inserting the end of a ½ inch drive ratchet into the hole at the center of the pulley. In some vehicles, it may be a bolt head you will need to locate the proper size wrench to turn. Twist the pulley clockwise to bend the tensioner arm down and remove the tension from the belt.If the belt tension is held in place using the alternator bracket, loosen the bolts that pass through the eyelets on the bracket to relieve the belt tension.  Make note of how the belt is run through the engine. If it is strictly for use on the fan, it will have very few twists and turns, but if it is a more modern serpentine belt design, it may need to pass through and around a number of pulleys. Your vehicle’s service or owner’s manuals should provide a diagram on how the belt is to be run, but you still may want to get a good look at it before removing it.If you do not have a diagram of how the belt should be run, take a picture of the old belt with your phone before removing it.  Run the new belt through the pulleys in the same way the previous one was. Be sure the belt fits onto each pulley evenly and in a completely straight line to avoid damaging the belt and making lots of noise.Refer to the owner’s or service manual for your specific vehicle to be sure you’ve run the fan or serpentine belt correctly. Running the belt at an angle will result in loud squealing. Be sure it is mounted flat and evenly.  With the new belt in place, relieve the tension you have applied to the auto tensioner to secure it. In vehicles equipped with a bracket to apply tension, insert a pry bar between the bracket and the block and pry it away from the engine. Tighten the eyelet bolts with tension applied.Visually inspect the new belt to ensure it is straight. Start the vehicle to check for squealing.	Purchase a replacement belt. Relieve the tension on the belt. Remove the belt from the engine. Install the new belt. Apply tension to the belt.
It's a major change, but it's a certain way to give new attention to an old, boring room.

Start by creating a chain of however many stitches you need to complete your project.Check the gauge of your yarn to determine how many stitches you will need to chain.   For a thick scarf, you might make a chain of 30 to 50 stitches, depending on the size of your yarn and crochet hook. Then, you could work this chain in the round until it is the length you want it to be. You could also make a cowl in this way. To work in the round for a hat, start with a chain of five. This will allow you to work the camel stitch outwards from a small circle. If you choose to work the camel stitch this way, then your garment will have a spiral look to it., After you finish your chain, use the slipstitch to connect in in a circle.Be careful not to twist the chain.   To do a slipstitch, insert your needle through the back loop of the beginning of the round, then loop the working end of your yarn over the hook, and pull this loop through the back stitch.This will connect the beginning and end of your round.  To work in the camel stitch, begin by chaining two and then half double crochet. Continue to half-double crochet all the way around the circle. When your each the end of the round, use a slipstitch to connect the yarn back into the circle., For the third round, start by chaining two and then half-double crochet into the third loop. The third loop is the one behind the back loop. You can locate it by turning the stitches slightly. This stitch is called the third loop because it is the third stitch from the front. Continue to HDC into the third loop to the end of the round.Use a slipstitch to connect the end of the round with the beginning of the round.  For the fourth round and each round after this one, chain two and then HDC to the end of the round. Finish each round with a slipstitch to connect the beginning and end of the round.Keep crocheting until you reach the desired length.	Chain the desired amount of stitches. Slipstitch into the first chain to connect the round. Chain two and half-double crochet the second round. Chain two and half-double crochet into third loop. Continue to chain two and half-double crochet into third loop.
Imagine you are a cat. Choose your colour, markings, personality and eye colour? Create a warrior name for your cat. Keep the name neutral however - don't use words that cat's don't know, like "plastic". Something that is related to where they live would be good (such as Pinefur). Or you can use a name based on an animal, (Crowcall) their appearance, (Palepelt) or their personality (Flameheart).; , Name it something natural - names like MetalClan are not natural. Try something like TreeClan or BreezeClan, or you can use one of the original clan names: ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, or SkyClan. Make sure the clan name makes sense too, and that it matches the warriors in the clan personality.  Make sure you name your clan so that the other clans know which clan you are. Just put a name then the suffix -clan (Example: FireClan). Also make sure that when you name your clan you name it based off of your territory or clan specialty.  Find a few apprentices, warriors, kits, a medicine cat, deputy, and leader if you aren't. You can talk about your new clan when your friends are around. They may want to join your clan if it seems fun enough. Have some friends be apprentices, some warriors, one the deputy, and one the medicine cat. Elders and queens aren't really necessary since they don't do much in a clan often.   If they don't know about warriors that much, make them apprentices. If you have too many apprentices, make young ones kits, and the ones who know more about the warrior cat series Warriors, deputy, or medicine cat.  If you don't have enough players, substitute with plush cats. They'll work, as long as you have 2-3 warriors and apprentices, a deputy, medicine cat. Make sure to have a fresh-kill pile for them! Use other items for pretend fresh kill.  The kitchen can have the fresh kill pile, the bathroom can be the dirtplace, etc.  Your house is the territory. Make a pile of things and cover it with a large blanket. Try using blue construction paper and put it near your door to make it look like water. A nice cardboard tree will help, too. You can use stickers on your walls to make your room seem more natural.  The Highrock is where the leader stands, and in the inside is the leader's den. Make it out of soft, comfortable things such as pillows. Stack a few pillows then put a blanket straight and put something strong then a pillow or two then another blanket on top of the pillows.  Make sure to hide it so if your camp gets attacked the kits and queens are safe and, make it out of strong pillows so if anyone aged six and under is inside if it falls, it won't fall and hurt them.  Make it with strong pillows, and make your own herbs with food you can eat.  Make it out of strong pillows, and put folded blankets as the nests.  Use strong pillows and put folded blankets as the nests.  Make a map so you know exactly were everything is and so you don't accidentally trespass another unknown clan territory!	Create a warrior cat. Make your own clan. Name your clan. Find some friends to be in your clan. Use substitutes. Decide which room will be for which part of the camp. Make your room look like your clan camp. Make a Highrock. Make the nursery. Make a medicine den. Make a warrior's den. Make an apprentice den. Make a map.
You can’t just instantly take to the stage, take clothes off, and consider yourself a Burlesque Artiste because you have a feathered fan. It’s about using every little prop, and body part, to your advantage. Is Burlesque for you? What is it? Where did it come from? If you have never heard of Lili St Cyr or Gypsy Rose Lee then you haven't learned enough! History of Burlesque is just as important as the technicalities.   Find out all you can about the history, and find people who inspire you.       Write a list of all the things a Burlesque Artiste has to do, and compare them with what you know you can achieve. Still think you have what it takes?       Lovely ladies who you may want to look into are Burlesque artists: Lili St Cyr, Gypsy Rose Lee, Sally Rand, (and more recently) Dita Von Teese, Catherine D’lish, The Sweet Soul Burlesque Troupe from Vancouver… fetish and pinup model Bettie Page, movie icons Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Betty Grable, Barbera Stanwyck, Rita Hayworth, and Mae West for style and glamour inspiration.      ; , Learn how to use a pole and a barre, get fit and into shape, and get yourself the way you will be on stage. It doesn't matter whether you're a little chubby or whether you're stick thin. Burlesque used to be for curvy honeys but it's now for everyone. Get classes on dance, drama, and stage work, and choreography if you can. Watch dance shows and films, get to grips with how to work those limbs.   If you can’t find any troupes or shows near you to join, you can start out in pole/strip clubs if they’d take a classier act. Remember that hands-on audiences are a no-no! Burlesque, is, of course, stripping (usually down to pasties and a g-string) but the tease part is the main bit! Remember dolls, Dita Von Teese started out in a strip joint!       If there’s no chance there, then local bars and clubs need shows and performances of entertaining value to draw in customers on the nighttime. A classy bit of Burlesque is great here also, though it does help if you can sing a little cabaret!       If you have trouble finding a troupe, don’t start there. More on troupes later! If you do join a troupe, you probably don’t need the rest of this guide! Listen to these lovely ladies and ask yourself if it’s the life you want. If not, search for another troupe, or go it solo.    In every Burlesque Beauty’s closet (in addition to their own signature props and costumes, of course!) should be: a sheer negligee, a pair of slippers or heels that have feathers or fluff on them somewhere, a pair of heels or stilettos in satin, patent, or covered in rhinestones or glitter, thigh high stockings in nude and black, suspender belts in the three base colours (red, black, and white)- or better - a corset or waspie with suspender snaps! You will also need, of course, matching underwear, and above all: pasties! Pasties and nipple tassels are a must if you intend on taking off so much! You should also have a feather fan to incorporate somewhere. Other musts are bold lipstick colours, black liquid eyeliner, and nail polish to match your lipsticks of course!       For hair and make-up: try cherry red lips, and black cat-flicked eyeliner. Look at vintage hairstyles for inspiration in the eras 20’s, 30’s, 40’s and 50’s. Barrel-curled hair is easy, best done with nylon net rollers and pins! You can also use hot-rollers, they are great and quick before a show! Invest in lots and lots of hairspray. Be bold with colour. If you’re wearing a blue corset, wear blue nail varnish and blue lipstick, but line the edge of your lips in black and blend them together for twilight to midnight look. If you’re wearing lilac, wear lilac lipstick, smoking purple eyes, and matching polish. Oh, and don’t forget your toenails need love too!       Clothing: Be a vintage vixen. Curvy wiggle dresses, cocktail gowns, and all manners of retro clothing remind of a more glamorous era when ladies always wore a pair of stockings. Nothing better than to create the illusion of that in the minds of common males, eh? Pillbox hats are brilliant- or any hat with a veil actually. Mini top hats are gorgeous accessories and so are big hair flowers and fascinators.  If you don’t join a troupe, it’s important that you practice the basics. Taking corsets off with one hand, dancing on your tip toes as though you’re wearing high heels, extending the arms and legs gracefully, and so on doesn’t come naturally to some people. Depending on what type of act you want to do, you will need to learn different things, but as a rule of thumb you need to be able to take your clothes off and look good doing it! The idea is that you don’t look like you’re concentrating. When you get dressed and undressed, always try to do it one-handedly, and also as though someone is watching you so you must keep all your intimate parts covered! Can you change your bra without taking off your blouse?   There are tons of props just waiting to be bought or made, and inspiration all around you! You might already have been inspired!       Signature routines: You must be bold! Dream up anything! So your show is budget. Economy versions are often best because they have been thought about! Flick through fancy dress costume catalogues for some great ideas, and traipse through charity stores to see if you’re inspired by a piece of jewellery, or a certain bodice or skirt. Don’t be a copycat darling! Originality is key. The Martini Glass (all credits to the gorgeous Ms. Von Teese) has been done, and so have the diaphanous bubbles! What do you like in your house? What do you like in your city? You can base a routine around anything!       Seductive tricks: On stage- learn to suspend yourself from a pole and slide down it v-legged. Learn how to take all your clothes off (besides those pasties and panties of course!) with only a fan in each hand as coverage and not show the pasties or panties! Learn how to sit on a chair provocatively. Chairs are great, cheap props, and everyone loves a chair routine! Learn to lock eyes with your audience. They won’t know what hit them. To tease whilst seated, stretch out your legs and rub them round as though feeling the seam up the back, or caressing the stockings. You can also disrobe with your back turned to your audience. Especially taking off that corset or bra… they won’t immediately know about your pasties!        , It may come as a shock, but you may find it hard to walk around in jeans and a tee-shirt. Why? Because it's not glamorous. Is Audrey Hepburn famous for wearing jeans? No! Did Marilyn Monroe’s tracksuit bottoms puff up with air? These are two lovely ladies who were known for class, style, sex appeal, and yet they weren’t Burlesque honeys - but they were still icons. You work, learn, and live the fluffy wedge slippers and chiffon nightgowns, but Burlesque is almost about everything we do. If you wear a bullet bra on stage, wear one off stage, and if you wear matching underpinnings on stage, wear them off stage. You’ll probably feel better about yourself too! Be a glamour girl every minute of every day if you want to be a real Burlesque ‘star’. It’s a lifestyle, and it doesn’t have to be expensive either!   Learn to look modest, to pout, to laugh, to adjust your stockings when you know people are looking but pretend to be trying to do it discreetly, be glamour and class personified. Apply lipstick in public in a powder compact, do wiggle when you walk, do wear heels, do act like a 50’s movie star and you’ll feel like one!        , Things are smooth, and you’re a glamour kitty, okay, but you want to be a star, right? You want to have the glitz, the real crystals instead of rhinestones, and be booked the world over for famous celebrity parties. You’re doing well at the bar/joint that you work, but you’re not earning wads of cash. So, of course, you need to build a brand for yourself. You need to create a demand, and then fulfill it. Hand out personal flyers and start getting bookings for parties. It may seem seedy, but there’s an art to being subtle and you’ve probably learned it already if you’ve come thus far without being dragged off down the ‘sleazy’ path. People book you, and people tell people. Build a website with your info, be available! Join an agency if you think it will help. Have hunger for it, and it will come. Organise your own show at a nice venue or hall, and make the tickets reasonable but to cover the cost- you can up the price later when there’s more demand. A new type of show will have plenty of support and you can advertise it in the local newspaper, on the radio, and on local news television if you can. Flyers, posters, anything as long as the image it conveys is something that will show people a classy and yet very artful and sexy type of performance. Above all, be original and be different, but not too strange or cult or people will be scared to see your show!  ,, For example a feline-oriented act would present the name "Ariella Von Kat" or Kat Firelust". Also, have a wardrobe consistent with your theme. You should also be able to sing, sword swallow, have some knowledge of theater or some other side act along with burlesque. You're going for artsy stuff here, NOT trashy!,, Once you join, it is imperative that you get along with the other dancers as much as possible. You will be kicked out if you cause discord, Also, you must always introduce yourself by your stage name for security reasons. Too much seduction, and some patrons might get the wrong idea., This guarantees they will come back. Who knows, you might become their favorite dancer!, Much like in show business, a dancer can only date within their own community i.e. dancers can date managers, master of ceremonies, choreographers and anyone else involved in the business.,, If you are likable, shows will be a breeze., Nobody likes a tyrant or hothead. You must all work together as a cohesive unit., You’re being booked up, sold out, and the next thing you know is you’re a local celebrity. Time to start planning shows in other cities and venues, no? Take it extreme. Create a troupe if you haven’t joined one. Local dancers might try it, local strippers might be looking for something to be more uptown. Create an interesting venture between yourself and your community, but don’t let any honeys upstage you, no no, you must be the most extravagant of them all. Plain Jane never got any attention after all!	Appreciate the art and further your knowledge of it. Get yourself to dance classes if you need them. Get the look. Practice and cultivate a show. You may want to throw away all your drab or store it away for a rainy day. Promote yourself.As a burlesque star, come up with your own stage name consistent with your signature act or a, spicy, seductive name.you can combine burlesque with ballet, bellydance, tap dance or any other style. once you become well-known, you will join a dance troupe or apply to be in one. never let patrons touch you. Have some level of friendliness and flirtatious behavior with the customers. Never reveal your real name to anyone except those closest to you. keep a strict and healthy diet: though dancers can come in all shapes and sizes, it is wiser to eat well to maintain a trim figure and do intense exercises like treadmill, cardio, Pilates etc. show respect for the other dancers in your troupe. Once you learn all you can and earn your stripes, you can form your own dance troupe, but apply all you've learned and treat new dancers respectfully. Take it up a notch.
The first and most likely cause for irises failing to bloom is overcrowding. Irises must be dug up, divided and replanted every three to four years.If this does not happen, it becomes less likely that your irises will bloom.; , Use a shovel to begin working the soil roughly six to eight inches away from the stems of the irises. Loosen the clump of iris roots away from the dirt.   When it is loosened up, lift the clump out of the ground with the tip of the shovel.  Pull multiple rhizomes apart by hand. Make sure there is a healthy fan of leaves attached to each rhizome.  Re-plant the remaining, healthy rhizomes right away. Choose a spot that is bright and sunny. The soil should drain quickly or else your irises will get soggy feet, which can also halt their ability to bloom.	Be aware that irises need to be divided. Cut the leaves down to a height of six inches. Shake the soil off the rhizomes so that you can divide them more easily. Throw away older pieces of rhizome with no leaves growing from them.
Pruning may seem counterintuitive, but is actually incredibly beneficial in aiding new growth on peach trees.   Pruning your peach trees produces new growth, which in turn produces more fruit. Therefore, pruning yields a larger crop over time. Peach trees need to be open to sunlight, as shaded branches won’t produce as much fruit. Pruning them opens up all branches to the sun. Removing dead parts of the tree is necessary so that new branches can come in. If you intend on spraying your tree with pesticides, pruning allows for an equal coverage over the entire plant.; , The best time to prune your peach trees is early spring, after the last major cold snap of winter. Avoid pruning in very cold weather though, as this can reduce the trees’ cold-hardiness and total output of fruit.   The best month for pruning is typically February, but adjust this time based on your local weather. Prune older trees before younger ones to allow time for the new growth. Avoid pruning when the trees are blooming or shortly after blooming, because this can negatively affect the new growth. Prune your peach trees at planting or at the next spring (if done in the fall). It is better to prune a little late in the year than a little early., Use pruning shears for smaller, more manageable branches. Remove large limbs with loppers or a pruning saw.   Wound dressing is available to put on branches post-pruning, but has shown to have little to no effect in preventing fungal growth., When you are cutting back branches, it is best to follow the “cat tossing” rule. All the branches on your peach tree should be wide enough apart that a cat could be tossed between each of them without ever hitting a branch.   A total height of 8–9 feet (2.4–2.7 m) is preferred when the tree is at its maturation. Prune the tree low to start, to encourage outward growth instead of upward. For big, full fruit, remove up to 90% of all developing fruit. A healthy tree will produce much more than it is capable of carrying, and must have most of it removed for the best output.	Prune your peach trees to help them grow. Know when to prune. Choose your pruning tools. Know how much to prune.
Unless you are painting a mural, you might want to limit your colors to two or three; this includes the base/background color of the wall. If you make your wall too busy, it will draw attention away from the rest of your room. Here are some color ideas to get you started:   If you want a more subtle look, use two different shades for your wall and design. For example, you can paint your wall a dark blue, and stencil on some bird silhouettes in light blue. If you want a bolder look, use contrasting colors. For example, you can paint your wall a fresh, spring green, and some leaf and branch outlines in bright white. You can also paint colored designs. For example you could start with a dark brown or black branch on a white wall. Then, you could add some light pink cherry blossom flowers to the branch.  Most walls with designs have a specific theme to them. The easiest designs to paint are silhouettes or outlines. They will be just enough to add some interest and movement to your wall, but they won't be so busy as to detract attention from the rest of your room. Here are some common themes:   Nature-related, such as branches, leaves, and birds Abstract designs, such as scrolls and damask  , Do you want your design to cover the entire wall, or just a small patch? How you arrange the design is important. Here are some ideas to get you started:   If you are covering your entire wall with the design, consider a grid or checked pattern. If you are covering just a small patch, consider making the patch more asymmetric than asymmetric. If you are using both large and small shapes in your design, try to place the larger designs more towards the center of the patch, and the smaller designs towards the edges.  Most acrylic paints will have a glossy, satin/semi-gloss, or matte finish. Most walls will have a satin/semi-gloss or matte finish. If you use the same finish for both your wall and your design, you will get a more uniform result. The design will blend into the wall, and look like it is part of it. If you use contrasting finishes (such as a glossy design on a matte wall), you will get a bolder result. The design will contrast with the background/wall, which can create a very interesting result.  Some designs are better suited to certain rooms than other designs. For example, you might consider a more energized design in a room that sees a lot of activity, such as a family room. Bedrooms are generally a place of rest, so a more peaceful design might do better there. Here are some ideas to get you started:   For a fancy dining or family room, consider using dark, rich colors. Use ornate designs, such as scrolls and damask. For a kitchen, consider using something bright and open. You can also paint some food-related designs, such as grapevines or citrus. For a bedroom, use colors that you find peaceful. These can be cool blues and purples, refreshing greens, or even pastels. Consider using something organic for the design, such as long, sweeping curves, leaves, flowers, or branches.	Choose your color scheme. Pick a theme. Decide on the layout. Consider the paint finish. Consider the room that you are painting.
The parts required are a silicone heating pad, a temperature controller, and a "soup" can.  The heating pad can be obtained from an auto parts store, a pet store (aquarium heater) or online.  The wattage needed is low -- look for ones rated for 110VAC, about 2" X 6" (not very critical), and with a wattage rating of less than 20W. The cost should be about $20 to $30. The temperature controller (i.e., thermostat) can be obtained on eBay for about $3. One rated for NC (normally closed) and about 25C (77F) to 40C (103F) is suitable. A commonly available part is the KSD301 but it has variants for many temperatures -- look for one in the lower temperature range. Any can from your pantry will do; it should fit loosely over the existing filter. (Check your filter and choose a can accordingly.) Three other "parts" are a small amount of fiberglass or similar insulation, a 2 1/2 to 3" hose clamp, and some duct tape.; , Once the parts are on-hand, the next step is to add the thermostat to the silicone pad heater. The heater comes with a 110V cord and socket. Separate the two wires close to the pad (a pocket knife works well) and cut the "ground" or neutral side of the cord. Strip about 1/4" of insulation off each exposed wire.        The thermostat will likely come with stripped leads.  It makes no difference which "direction" the thermostat is connected -- it is just a simple switch that is "on" below the set-point and "off" when it is above that point. Twist the pairs of wires together and solder the connections. (Wire "nuts" will probably work but are bulky and may be prone to failure from heat and vibration.  Crimp connections may work.) Wrap the connections with electrical tape or use heat-shrink tubing., A fuse is desirable for protection in case of short or other circuit failure. At 110V, a fuse of .5 Amp is suitable as that will work with heating pads up to about 25 watts. The fuse is an in-line design and is soldered into the "hot" side of the 110V wiring by cutting off the plug, separating the wires, stripping, and soldering. Cover the joint with electrical tape or shrink tubing., Testing of the pad can be done very carefully at this stage. The pad will get very hot very quickly and will burn if plugged into 110V! An appropriate test that is safe is to use an ohmmeter and check for a low resistance when the thermostat is cool (ice bath?) and an infinite resistance when the thermostat is warm (say 80F). In case the resistance at low temperatures is also high or infinite, recheck the connections!, The can probably will not fit perfectly over the oil filter. For the Generac system, the can should fit easily but snugly over the mount for the oil filter. You can cut some small slits in the open end of the can at roughly 90-degrees so that a hose clamp can be used to secure the heater to the mounting plate (or just the oil filter)., The silicone pad comes with a paper backing and has adhesive under that. The can used was not smooth so the pad did not adhere well., The other problem was how to attach the thermostat to the can. The solution was to wrap the pad and thermostat with high-temperature tape (duct tape is designed for this).  A perfect thermal path is not required as the temperatures that should be present will be between 60F or so and the operating temperature of the generator oil.  During normal conditions when the generator is not running, the maximum temperature should be no more than about 10F more than the thermostat specification.  It is desirable to limit heat loss (but not critical). Wrapping the can with a layer of fiberglass batting or some similar insulation layer will provide more-than-sufficient heat retention. There is no problem with over-heating when the generator is running as the oil temperature is automatically limited.  You can put a layer of insulation over the can bottom held-on by a couple of strips of tape. The circumference of the can was then wrapped with insulation and a layer of tape applied loosely so as to not crush the insulation., The side of most Generac systems removes to provide easy access to the oil filter and battery. Once the side is removed, put the hose clamp around the open end of the can (where the slits are) and slide the whole heater and clamp over the oil filter. As noted, for at least the test system, the can fit nicely around the mount for the oil filter -- the hose clamp was tightened with a screwdriver to hold the heater over the oil filter., Usually this will require turning off all power to the home unless there is a local disconnect for just the generator., The Generac system comes with a 110V socket on the outside, but it is "live" only when the generator is running. To connect the heater to power it is necessary to connect the stripped wires to the N1 and Neutral wires under the generator control panel. N1 and N2 provide 240V while either N1 to Neutral or N2 to Neutral will provide 110V. Access to these connectors is under a plastic cover just above the control panel. Unless you are competent in working with high voltage wiring, this step should be done only by an electrician. There is a YouTube ("Generac Cold Weather Kit Installation") showing this general installation., Reinstall the plastic cover over the connector box and the metal panel covering the wiring and battery. Reinstall the side panel., Turn the utility disconnect back to the "on" state., It will be difficult to perform a complete operational test unless the outside temperatures are below the thermostat set-point which will be true for many areas except in the summer. A primary test will be to test that the heater is operational when the generator is running. Generac systems have a manual run switch that makes it very simple to start the engine. Run the system for several minutes to make sure the hose clamp and can are secure from vibration and heat during running. Let the system cool-down and check that the heater system is still secure. Replace the side of the generator enclosure.	Obtain the parts.  Connect the thermostat.  Connect the thermostat wires to the cut in the cord. Install a fuse. Test. Assemble the heater.  Mount the hot pad.  Wrap the pad and thermostat with tape.  Insulate the can assembly. Install the heater on the Generac. Disconnect the generator from local power. Connect the heater. Reassemble the generator. Reconnect the power. Test your system.
Do this all the way along the length.   Only draw the cutting marks 3/4 of the way, as the fringe needs to stay intact.    Only cut 3/4 of the way to ensure that the fringe pieces stay in place.  This creates the desired mane volume. The fringes should overlap slightly, to make it easier to see the fringes in the bottom layers.  The circle that forms should fit around the face of the wearer for whom this was measured.   Use the extra piece cut for joining to make this easier; check around the face area before making the join final.	Use a ruler to mark regular spaces for cutting the fringe on each length. Cut each fringe piece along each length. Staple or glue the fringe lengths together. Tape the ends together.
Choose something you think you'll enjoy to avoid getting bored. Go online and look at reviews on large sites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb to see if it's a good movie.; , You may have to buy them in advance at an online site, or go to the box office early to make sure it's not sold out.  Normally, theater lobbies will be jam-packed with people on weekends, so allow 20-30 minutes to get your tickets, get snacks, and then get good seats. Allow extra time for blockbusters, like a Harry Potter film or The Hunger Games.  If you have kids with you, limit how many extra items they can have. Try not to buy a lot of snacks: the movie seats are generally small, and you won´t focus in the movie if you have to rescue that falling super-size stack of candy.  A great way to save money on snacks is if you put a box of candy in your purse and pockets. Buy drinks at the theater; if you put them in your bag, they may leak.  No theater in their right mind is going to ask to search your pants pocket for snacks - too much risk of a sexual harassment lawsuit.  If you planned ahead and arrived early, you might be able to sit at a desirable seat. The best seats in most cinemas are at the back of the room because you won´t have those annoying seat-kickers, or in the middle as you will have the best view there. Try not to arrive late, or these seats might be occupied by people.  After you have watched the movie, you can discuss the movie with friends or family that you went with.	Decide on what to watch. Know how to get the tickets. The movie schedule must be at your fingertips. Buy snacks and be prepared to pay more. Most movie theaters like it if you buy food from them, but they normally don't enforce the rule. If you're bringing your own snacks, wear cargo pants - it's far easier to stash snacks in cargo pockets (just don't stuff them to the gills). Pick your seats. Discuss the film.
After opening your can of paint, mix it thoroughly, then pour enough of it to do the job into a separate, clean container. If the paint has been stored for any length of time, it is a good idea to strain it through a paint filter to remove any lumps of hardened paint which may have formed. These lumps can stop up the siphon tube or the metering valve, causing the flow of paint to stop.  The exact ratio of paint to thinner will depend on your paint, sprayer, and nozzle type, but the paint should usually be thinned by about 15 to 20% for a good flow. Notice how thin the paint looks when you use an aerosol spray paint; this will give you an idea of what you are looking for.  Whether the spray cup attaches to the bottom of the sprayer with a clamping assembly and hooks or screws on, be sure to attach it securely; you do not want the spray cup to drop off suddenly while in use.  Practice moving the spray gun in a side to side, or up and down sweeping motion, parallel to the surface. If you have never used this type of paint applicator before, practice holding and swinging it for a moment to get a feel for the balance and weight.  Keep the sprayer moving whenever the trigger is squeezed to avoid drips and runs caused by over application.   It’s best to test-paint a piece of scrap wood or cardboard before tackling the main job. This way, you can adjust the nozzle if necessary to get a finer spray pattern.  This way, the "feathered" edges of the spray pattern don’t leave thin spots in your paint job. Watch for drips and runs, moving fast enough to keep the paint from getting thick as you spray.  Do not allow the sprayer to sit with paint in it; if you need a break, remove the cup and spray some thinner through the sprayer before leaving it unused.  For most paints, a good, even "wet" coat is sufficient, but a second coat may give a more durable finish. Sanding between coats is recommended for varnishes, polyurethane finishes, and other glossy paints to improve the bond between the coats.	Mix enough paint to do your project. Thin the paint with a suitable thinner. Fill the paint cup about 2/3 of the way with paint and lock it onto the sprayer. Hold the sprayer about 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm) from the surface. Squeeze the trigger to spray the paint. Overlap each pass slightly. Refill the paint cup as needed until the project is done. Allow the paint to dry, then re coat if desired.
Is the unit simply not working at all, is it not cooling the air much, or is it simply blowing around warm air?; ,   Make sure it's plugged in. This may seem obvious, but there are occasions when this is exactly the problem. Whether kids, dogs, or an accidental tap with the vacuum cleaner, the plug could be partially or completely dislodged. Check the circuit breakers and fuses. Make sure they are in place, turned on, and functioning properly. Circuits, especially with older homes, are easily overloaded if the air conditioner shares a circuit with appliances such as irons, refrigerators, or microwaves. Check your thermostat (cooling control) and make sure it is set to cool at the current temperature, and working properly. As with plugs, sometimes settings can change by accident.  This can cause low air flow which allows ice to form, and thus causes low cooling performance.   Repair or replace the blower belt. Allow the ice to melt before restarting the AC unit.  If they are caked with dust and debris, clean them thoroughly. Make sure you let any ice melt before restarting your unit.  If you've verified that everything is connected, powered, set up properly, and clean, it may be time to call the service department.	Assess the problem. It's not working at all: the condenser (for an outdoor unit) or air handler/furnace (indoor unit) are not running. Check your fan blower belt for excessive slack, damage, or breakage. Check the coils and filter. Call for service.
Cut the faux fur in an approximately 6 inch (15.2 cm) circle. Try using a lid, small plate, or other circular object as a guide.A 6 inch circle will create a pom pom that will fit in the palm of your hand. You can make the circle larger or smaller depending on the size that you would like your pom pom to be.; , Thread your needle with some heavy duty thread, fishing line, or yarn. Then, begin inserting the needle into the faux fur along the outer edge of the circle. Weave the needle in and out of the fabric to create a baste stitch around the outside of the circle.Don’t make the stitches too close together or you may not be able to pull them to shape the pom pom. Try to keep them about ½” apart.  After you have woven the thread around the entire circle, begin to pull the ends of the thread. This will begin to shape the circle of fabric into a pom pom shape.If you cannot pull in the fabric by pulling on the thread, then the stitches may be too tight. You may need to remove the thread and start over with more space between the stitches. Make sure that you leave an opening at the top of the pom pom. You still need to fill it with stuffing before you close it.  You can use nylon stuffing, cotton balls, or scrap fabric to stuff your pom pom. Place the stuffing in the center of the pom pom.Do not overfill the pom pom. Add just enough to give it a round shape.  When you are satisfied with the level of stuffing in your pom pom, pull the thread to tighten it, and then tie the ends of the thread together. Tie a few knots to ensure that your pom pom will be secure.After you finish tying the knots, your pom pom is ready to use!	Cut your faux fur into a circle. Baste along the edges of the circle. Pull the ends of the thread. Stuff the pompom. Tighten and tie the thread.
Do you like rock music? Hannah Montana? Football? Choose themes that you've liked for a long time and will continue to love after you've decorated your room.; , Is there something that you enjoy, but it's something you may not love in a month, week, year or two? It's OK to have fads, but make sure you know what they are.  Your redecorating may take awhile. On a day you know you're free, take everything out of your room.  This is one of the only times you can vacuum all of the floor, so it's a good idea to take some time on it.  Make sure it's a color that will match your personality now and a couple years from now. , If you love football, consider a new football-shaped chair, drapes or curtains with footballs, a bedspread with your favorite team logo, and posters with your favorite players. Remember that these are long-term investments, and will be expensive if you replace weekly.  For fads and passing phases, choose small, inexpensive items. A new mouse pad, stickers, pillowcases, small pictures or posters, and figurines are cheap and easy to replace if you decide you don't like them anymore.  If your interest involves doing something (football, knitting, rock collecting), see if you can use the equipment or the product of that interest as decoration in itself. Get a stand and feature your favorite football or a decorative basket for your knitting. You will feature your interest as part of your style, encourage yourself to use your favorite things, and tackle the storage problem, all at once.  If you've sewn, built, or painted something, show it off in your room. You can also show off things like awards, photos, and memorabilia. Making your own decorations can also be cheaper and more interesting than buying them.  If you like to collect something, build or buy it appropriate shelves, display cabinets or racks. Change out older collections for new ones, or rotate which items you display of a larger collection. Displaying a collection in this way keeps it fresh while making it a part of the décor.   Try enclosed storage, such as a covered case, if you hate dusting.	Identify your favorite things. Identify your fads. Find a day when you know you'll have plenty of time. Clean the carpet. Paint. Put your furniture back into your room, and organize them in a practical way that you'll still like in time.  , Decorate the large pieces of your room with them with the long-term interests you identified at the beginning. Match the permanence of the interest to the permanence of the decoration. Display the equipment or gear associated with your hobbies or activities. Display the results of your hobbies and talents, too. Make the shelves permanent and the collection variable.
For beginners, finding a corset pattern online or in a pattern catalog is recommended over trying to make a custom-fit pattern. A good pattern will be adjustable to fit your size and should provide perfectly satisfactory results.   Keep in mind that a simple, basic corset pattern will usually be better for a novice than a complex one. Corsets can be difficult to make, so take it easy on yourself the first time or two around. You can find corset patterns for free and for sale, but the best kind usually fall into the latter category. You should be able to find an easy to follow corset pattern on the internet or in the sewing department of a craft store. Alternatively, you can also make a custom corset pattern, but the process involves intricately plotting out your measurements on graph paper.; , A good pattern has multiple sizes marked on it, ranging usually from 6 to 26. Most patterns allow for 2 inches of ease in the back for lacing up the corset, so don't be alarmed if the pattern seems especially small. Find your size by taking your bust, waist, and hip measurement. Once you have the appropriate size, cut out the pattern.   Wrap a tape measure around the widest part of your bust while wearing a standard bra for your bust measurement. Find your waist measurement by wrapping a tape measure around the thinnest part of your waist, 2 inches (5 cm) above the navel. The corset is a garment worn to shape your body. Normally, you'll subtract 4 inches (10 cm) from your waist measurement. The hip measurement can be found by wrapping a tape measure around the widest part of your hips. This is roughly 8 inches (20 cm) below your waist measurement.  The best material to use for a corset is corset coutil, because it is specifically designed for corsets, 100% cotton so it's breathable, very strong for its weight, and has little give in any direction. If you don't have coutil you can use a sturdy cotton duck (canvas) or quality linen.If you use duck fabric or linen, know that your corset will have more give in the finished product and will likely fit a bit larger than if made from coutil. You can also add inner lining to your corset for extra comfort. Use a firmly woven cotton or cotton blend and cut and sew the lining following the pattern for the corset. When you choose thread for your corset, test it first to check the quality of the thread. All-purpose thread should be fine, but before you use it, unravel a length and try to snap it with your hands. If it doesn't break easily it is fine to use, but don't use thread that breaks easily because it will undergo a lot of tension in the corset and you want it to be sturdy.  Wash and dry the fabric before you use it and iron it flat to remove any wrinkles or folds before cutting the fabric.   Check the grain. If you examine fabric closely you'll see that it has a "weft thread," which is the thread that is horizontal across the fabric, and a "warp thread" which intersects the waft thread at a right angle and is vertical across the fabric. These terms are also interchangeable with the terms "grain line" and "cross-grain." You'll want to cut the fabric along the stretchiest grain line, so stretch the fabric in both directions, determining which direction is more stretchy. Often times fabric will have a red line with arrows showing the grain line, and the perpendicular line to that is the cross-grain., Lay the pattern vertically over the fabric, following the grain line with the most amount of stretch, which is most likely the cross-grain. You should avoid excess stretch encircling your waist. Pin the pattern onto the fabric.You could also use pattern weights, which can be stones or weights that help hold the pattern in place. If you opt for this method, outline the pattern with chalk before cutting. Sometimes this is a better option because it prevents any distortion when cutting the fabric.  Make sure that you cut the pieces out according to the pattern instructions. Be a perfectionist when doing this, because the fabric needs to be the exact measurements as the pattern, or your corset won't fit correctly.   Depending on the fabric pattern you have, you may need to cut some of the pieces twice. Some patterns require you to cut the center-back pieces twice, the center-front piece once, and all other pieces twice, with all cuts on the fold and with no seam allowance at the back. Follow the pattern's instructions for how many cuts you need to make., Assemble all the pieces as directed according to your pattern's instructions. Pin the pieces in place to prevent them from moving around as you sew.   You could also loosely baste (temporary stitches intended to be removed) the pieces together to accomplish the same result. If your seams are trued, meaning that they match properly, you might be able to match up the top edges and guide the machine as you form seams without using pins or basting.  Using a very small straight stitch, stitch your pieces together in order of the pattern. Start from top to bottom and go very slowly down the fabric, making sure the fabric doesn't shift or bunch. When you are finished, you should have two halves of your corset.Make sure when sewing pieces together that you are sewing the right pieces together. It could help to number the pieces on the back with a piece of white chalk.  Once all the seams have been stitched, you should press them open toward the back. They should lie flat when done.   Trim off excess fabric if necessary to prevent bunching. Note that you could also press the seams open as you go along.  You won't be sewing your corset together past this point, you'll be using the busks and grommet area to attach it together, so you'll want all of the edges of your corset to have a nice clean seam.   Make sure not to sew the top and bottom of your corset, as this will be sewn with binding.  Cut two pieces of waist tape for the two halves of your corset, with no stretch. Lay the waist tape across the line of most tension in your corset (you can figure this out by pulling your corset to find the tension). Sew the waist tape to the seam allowance on the back of your corset, basting it in place along the line of the tape.Waist tape can be twill tape, a sturdy ribbon, or tailor's tape of 5/8 inch or 7/8 inch width. To find the measurements for your waist tape, use your desired waist measurement, add two inches and then divide by two, cutting the two pieces to equal the final measurement. When sewing your waist tape, make sure it lines up on both halves of your corset by lining up your corset on one side.  Fold boning casing tape so that the long edges of the tape meet in the center of the backside of the tape. Then, stitch the tape to the center of each corset panel to create 3/8 inch wide boning channels, or if you want less seams on the front of your corset you can stitch it along the already made seams.You can also use 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide strips of fabric if you don't want to purchase casing tape.  Take the inside of the right side of your corset, draw a stitching line in chalk 5/8 inch from the edge of your corset. Then, line your eye busk (the side with the hooks) up with your sewing line, leaving 3/4 inch from the top edge of your corset, making sure you are looking at the back of the busk. Sew along the busk, attaching it to your corset.   The busk is the piece with the "eyes or hooks" that the knobs or pins hook into on the front of your corset to attach it together (and will prevent you from having to untie the lacing on the grommet area each time you want to put on your corset). You can buy busks at a sewing or craft store.  Taking small metal knobs or pins that fit into your busk holes, line them up with the busk on the right. Then stick them through the left side of the fabric near the edge and connect them completely to the fabric by attaching them with a stitch on the back.  This is what will close up your corset and hide any ragged edges of the fabric. To use faux leather or real leather as your binding, place clear, water-soluble dressmaking tape along the bottom outside corner of one panel of your corset. Then, press the binding onto the tape, fold it over the edge, and tape to the inside of your corset as well.   You can also use satin, cotton, or another type of pre-made bias binding.  Use your sewing machine to straight-stitch the taped binding into place.   For now, you should only add binding to the bottom. You need to add your boning to the corset before you can finish the top.  Measure the length of the bone channels and cut spiral steel flats to the length of your corset leaving about 1/4 inch edge from the top and bottom of your corset, and insert bones into bone channels. You can cut these bones yourself or buy pre-cut bones (which is sometimes much easier).   You can also use spring steel flats, but spiral steel flats will do a better job of following all of the curves of your corset.To prevent rough edges of the bones you can use durable hot glue or craft glue to tip the bones.  Use the same taping and sewing technique you applied to the bottom edge of the corset to bind the top of the corset with additional, matching binding.  Space your eyelets/grommets roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart along both sides of the back of your corset, near the edge. As you reach the waist, space four pairs of eyelets more closely together by about 1/4 inch (1/2 cm). You can buy these at a local craft or sewing store.Grommets are the holes in the back of your corset in which you lace up your corset. Use a fabric punch, leather punch, or awl to punch the holes out for your eyelets. Hammer the eyelets in place from both sides with a rubber hammer.  Start at the top and lace the corset down to the waist using a crisscross pattern. Work from the bottom up in the same manner, again stopping at the waist. Tie your laces together at the waist in "bunny ear" or "tennis shoe" style.   You need about 5 yards (5 m) (4.5 m) of lacing total. Ribbon and twill are the most historically accurate forms of lacing, but flat lacing and cable cord hold up better in the long-term.  The top of the corset should begin just above the nipple area, and the bottom should extend over your hips without riding up.   Cinch the waist of the corset in by pulling the loops at the waist.

Use a simple two-step to find the beats in your favorite songs. Then you can be more confident finding the beat in the dance floor.Start with your feet together. Step your right foot to the side, then bring it back to center. Then do the same on the left with your left foot. Repeat until you feel that you can do it with confidence. If your steps are not lining up with louder drumbeats, it is likely that you are off the beat. Listen to the music for a moment, then start again, stepping on the louder parts of the beat.; , This requires less movement than the two-step, but a little bit more style. Start with your feet apart. Stomp your right foot. Then bring your shoulders to the right and spin your left foot on its toe so that your heel hits the floor to the right of it. As you hit your left heel on the floor, snap your fingers. Then repeat on the left side.  Flip or comb through your hair. Then shake your shoulders. Move your hips and then end with a step.   A lot of dance music is written in four, meaning that you count up to four or eight, and then change tactics. You can spend one beat on each move, but spending two beats is easier. This means that you hair comb for two beats, shake your shoulders for two beats, move your hips for two beats, and then two step for the last two.  In general, you can get away with a two-step on any dance floor. However, you may not know what to do with your arms. It is essential that you check the crowd around you to get the general feeling, however there are a few general rules you can follow.   Techno and EDM music is accompanied by fist pumping, or arm-pumping. Do whatever feels good with your hand, but pump your shoulder and elbow on each beat. Pop music is accompanied by arms in the air, often around the hair, or waving. Occasionally they move down the body. Hip hop music usually involves quick movements of the arms and hands from side to side. Women may choose to bring them above their heads, but usually they remain around the torso. Trance music is accompanied by very improvised, flowing arm movements.  Part of dancing is acting as well.You don’t need to smile the whole time, as this can look forced. Instead, raise your eyebrows slightly and think about the corners of your mouth going upward.   If you are too nervous to have fun, you can look like you are having fun. Sometimes this can actually have the effect of easing your nerves-- your muscles are in an “I’m having fun” configuration, and send the signal to your brain that you are having fun.  If you attach words to the movements that you make, you will be more likely to remember them. They will also relate to the music that your dance is set to. This creates a new way of thinking about movement. Your movements will often correspond to the mood and tone of the music. If the music is getting quieter, your movements might be getting smaller or lower to the ground. If there is a lot of percussion, you are probably making energetic movements.  Breathing deeply before you have to dance or go onstage will bring more oxygen to your brain. This will reduce your anxiety. Avoid hyperventilating, or breathing quickly. Take slow, even breaths.  You may imagine the space that you take up while dancing as a bubble that encompasses your head and length of your arms. As you dance, try to stretch or push at the edges of this bubble. These movements will make you appear more confident, because they will be large and dynamic. Don’t try to “punch through” your bubble, or make any sudden huge movements. Just go a little bit further out than usual.  If it's a bit difficult in the beginning, dance somewhere inconspicuous. Once you feel more brave, you can work your way to where more people are.   Some people prefer the all-in approach, where you go in to the most crowded part of the dance floor no matter how scared you are. Do whatever makes you comfortable.  It is easier to dance confidently if you don’t feel alone.   Trade dance moves with your friends. Do something, and then get them to join in with you-- or if they start to do something, join in with them.  Don't concentrate on the people around you - just dance.   A good way to go about this is to think, “They are too busy worrying about themselves to look at me”. This is always true. When you are dancing in front of people, you are much more worried about how you look than how they look. The same is true for everyone else.  When you feel self conscious, turn to your friends for help. If you talk to them about feeling nervous, it will take some of the pressure off of you to perform.   It may seem odd, but admitting that you are afraid can sometimes help with feeling afraid. You don’t have to feel uncomfortable in addition to being nervous. Laughing about your nervousness can be an incredible relief. , Self talk is the term for what you say to yourself when you are examining your own behavior. Sometimes it can be a comparison to someone else, and oftentimes it is negative. For example, “She’s such a great dancer. I wish I could dance like that. I’m so dull and boring.”   Instead of going a negative direction, go in a positive one. “She’s such a great dancer. I’m glad I get to see her being herself, it’s so inspirational. I’m going to try to be myself too.”  , Don’t get so caught up in being beautiful or the best that you can’t have fun.   Silly moves like the sprinkler and the shopping cart are just as fun as more mainstream moves like the Dougie. Have fun, and confidence will follow.	Find the beat. Use a simple step, like a step-snap, to start moving. Move from head to toe. Incorporate your arms. Keep an open look on your face. ”Sing” the rhythm. Breathe. Dance outside your bubble. Go at your own pace. Bring your friends with you. Pretend like no one's watching. Talk to your friends. Manage your self-talk. Be silly.No matter what, dancing is about having fun.
Flip over your canvas to expose the back. The cork board squares will sit inside the canvas’ wooden frame. Coat the back of the canvas with a thin layer of glue and place the cork board squares. After placing each piece, run your hand over the cork board to remove air bubbles. Cut the cork board as needed. When you’re done, the entire area inside the wooden frame of the canvas will be covered in cork board., Before you make any cuts, run over the fabric with a warm iron. This will remove any wrinkles or creases that may alter the dimensions of your fabric. Measure and mark the burlap so each edge is 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) more than the dimensions of the canvas. You will wrap this extra fabric around the frame. Cut your fabric.   You may use any fabric you want., Lay your fabric on a flat work surface. Place the canvas facedown in the center of the fabric. Fold one edge of fabric over the frame and insert staples along the entire length of the wooden frame. Repeat on the rest of the edges., The upholstery tacks will form a decorative edge around your memory board. You must position them over the wooden frame. Use a measuring tape and pencil to mark the location of each upholstery tack—the distance between the tacks is up to you. Hammer each tack into place., Flip your canvas over. Position and attach one or more D-Ring hangers on the wooden frame. You will use the hardware to hang the memory board.   This step is optional., You can attach your mementos with pushpins or thumbtacks. Choose pins and tacks that match the aesthetic of the board.	Glue the cork board to the back of your canvas. Iron and cut your burlap. Staple the burlap to the back of the frame. Hammer in the upholstery tacks to the front of the board. Attach D-Ring hangers to the back of the canvas. Add your memories.
Before you tune your instrument, make sure that it is actually a Greek-style bouzouki and not an Irish-style bouzouki. The two versions are typically tuned to different patterns, so it's important to know which version you have.   The easiest difference to identify is the shape of the instrument. A Greek bouzouki has a bowl-shaped back, but the back of an Irish bouzouki is flat. Scale length is another major difference. The Greek bouzouki has a longer scale measuring to 680 mm, while the Irish bouzouki has a scale length around 530 mm., The most traditional Greek bouzoukis have three string courses with two strings each, giving you a total of six strings. Other versions of the Greek bouzouki have four string courses with two strings each, or a total of eight strings.   Six-string bouzoukis are called trichordo models. Eight-string bouzoukis are called tetrachordo models. Note that most Irish bouzoukis have eight strings, but it is also possible for an Irish version to have six strings. The modern tetrachordo version is believed to date back to the 1950s, while the trichordo version dates back to ancient times., It should be easy to determine which tuning pegs adjust which string courses, but you should check the instrument before you begin to make the process as effective as possible.   Face the front of the bouzouki.  On the trichordo, the 2 knobs on the lower right adjust the highest-pitched strings. The 2 knobs on the lower left adjust the lowest-pitched strings, leaving the 2 end knobs on each side to adjust the middle strings. On the tetrachordo, the 2 knobs on the lower right adjust the highest pitched strings, the 2 knobs on the upper right adjust the next lowest strings, the 2 knobs on the upper left adjust the next lowest strings, and the 2 knobs on the lower left adjust the lowest pitched strings.   Each string of a course is attached to it's own tuning peg. You will adjust both strings of a course to the same pitch (or octaves, as is often the case for the lower pitched course or courses).  Trichordo bouzoukis are usually tuned to the pattern of D-A-D. Tetrachordo bouzoukis are traditionally tuned to the pattern of C-F-A-D.Individual players may choose to use an adapted tuning for a specific tune when playing on a trichordo bouzouki, but doing so is fairly uncommon and only done by experienced players. Many contemporary players choose to follow a D-G-B-E pattern for tetrachordo bouzoukis due, in part, to the similarity between this pattern and the pattern used for tuning a guitar. When playing Irish music on either an Irish or Greek tetrachordo bouzouki, a pattern of G-D-A-D or A-D-A-D is typically used. These tunings make the instrument easy to play in the key of D. If you have a short-scale instrument or large hands, it might be easiest to tune a tetrachordo bouzouki to a mandolin-style pattern of G-D-A-E. This tuning should be one octave lower than that used for an actual mandolin, however.	Verify that you have a Greek bouzouki. Count the strings. Match the strings to the tuning pegs. Know the pattern.
Performing a boat comparison can help to narrow down your search. Do you enjoy fishing on the local waterways? Are you looking for a boat to use for water skiing, wake boarding and exciting water sports? Are you looking for a craft designed for family boating? Or a powerboat for racing? Do you want a boat for a little of everything? There is a boat that's right for you. Consult a Boat Selector tool to choose the boat that is right for you. A boat buyer guide can help you choose the ideal boat for your specific needs.; , The size of boat you choose depends on how many people will be boating with you and where you plan on boating. Make sure you anticipate these things accurately to ensure boater safety each time you're under way. Every new boat has a National Marine Manufacturing Assoc. "NMMA capacity plate" that tells you how many people you can safely have on board. If your choice comes down to a question of 2–4 feet (0.6–1.2 m) in size, buy more if your budget allows. Doing this will allow you to keep your boat longer as your needs change. Choose a boat that is no more that 26-feet long if you plan on trailering your boat to different waterways and boat marinas.  When deciding what engine you will need on your boat, it's best to consider what you will be using your boat for. Water skiers will need more power, where fishing buddies probably use less. Today's buyer can also choose from new-tech engines that are more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. It's best to compare boats with different engine sizes and consult a boat buying resource to make the best choice.  Buying a boat doesn't have to be painful - there's a boat for every budget.

Allow the glass to dry for at least 24 hours before proceeding to the next step of heat setting. Stand them upside down on a soft surface such as a folded tea towel to allow them to dry. Try to keep them away from the kitchen or bathrooms, where moisture could affect the drying.   If you're air drying, it may need to be left to its lonesome for up to three weeks. Follow the instructions on the paint's label., If you chose the kind of paint that needs baking to be set, you've reached that time. The process is very straightforward and no, your glass won't melt!   Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Turn your oven to 350ºF (180ºC). There is no preheating required. The idea is to put the glass in a cold oven -- this will gradually increase heat as opposed to placing the glassware in a hot oven, which might cause the glassware to break. Immediately put the glasses on the lined sheet and place in the oven. Set a timer for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat after 20 minutes, but leave the glass in for a further 10 minutes. Then, remove the glasses after the 30 minutes is up.  Or, do as as instructed by the manufacturer on the label of the paints you've used (this is done to make the item washable).  Since some of your glasses might be suitable to give away for birthdays and other occasions, you could fill them up with candy, confetti, or birthday horns, etc. They make for great pieces to be used and taken home.   Consider signing your name or adding the name of the recipient to the bottom of the glass. Add a dab of glue and secure on a bow. A gift too pretty to be wrapped!	Let it dry. Heat set the glass. Embellish your creation.
Thoroughly wash a vase with hot water and soap. Use a bottle brush to scrub out any residue and then soak the vase in a 5% dilution of bleach for a several minutes.          Create a 5% dilution with one cup of bleach for every gallon of water. You should also use this dilution for cleaning your scissors before cutting your roses. Bacteria that deteriorate freshly cut roses may reside in vases that have not been clean.  Water your roses well the night before cutting them. The roses will have more substance thanks to the extra drink of water. While you water, make note of the location of the blooms you want to cut so that you can immediately refrigerate them after you have cut them in the morning.  Cut your roses in the morning. You may cut them as early as you have daylight, which can be anywhere from 5:00 am to as late as 10:00 am depending on the time of year. Cut your roses earlier if the weather is hot. In contrast, cut your roses later if there is a lot of morning dew.Try not to cut your roses at midday or later as they will have the least amount of substance. Keep your roses cool. Roses will last longer in cool weather and deteriorate in heat. If the weather is cool, you may be able to cut your roses later in the day.  The degree of openness you want for your roses depends on their intended use. Cut the roses just after their budding stage as the petals just start to unfurl if you want them to last longer, like in the use of a bouquet. The variety of rose will open determine when you should cut them as some may be cut at a more open stage.For example St. Patrick and Moonstone roses have many petals and can be cut when they are more open.  Cut the stems at an angle with clean, sharp cutters. The angle prevents the rose from standing flat, blocking any water from being absorbed. Place the roses in lukewarm or cold water as soon as they have been cut. Re-cut the stems when you have them underwater to eliminate air bubbles that can lead to premature wilting and shorten the life of your rose.Remove any foliage below the waterline if you’re using the roses for a bouquet.  Fill a bucket of water so that the stem of the flower is completely under water but the bloom remains dry. Let the flowers drink the water in a cool and dark room for an hour. Refrigerate your roses at 38 degrees fahrenheit or until you are about to use them.Cut roses will last longer if they are placed in the fridge overnight as you sleep.  Florists bread roses to last long once placed in a vase. If you are using you own roses, make note of which last longer once cut. Hybrid teas tend to last longer than antique roses.Varieties that tend to last longer in vases are:Crystalline Secret Red Intuition St. Patrick Veteran’s Honor Black Magic Andrea Stelzer Louise Estes Moonstone Elizabeth Taylor    , Floral preservative can be purchased online or at your local flower shop or garden supply store. They can be added to the vase water to extend the life of the roses. Change the vase water often as old water contains bacteria. Softened water may contain salt that is not good for roses.Cut your roses under water every day as you change the vase water.	Use a sanitized vase. Water your roses and make note of which blooms you want to cut. Cut your roses at the ideal time of day. Be mindful of how open you want you roses before cutting. Cut and re-cut the rose stems. Condition and refrigerate your bouquets. Select long-lasting rose varieties. Use flower preservation products and change the vase water often.
A motorcycle wheel chock is a wedge of metal or another sturdy material placed in front of the motorcycle's front wheel to prevent any movement.; , Push the motorcycle up a ramp, or have some helpers pick up the motorcycle to get it into the truck bed or trailer. , Soft loops are straps that keep the hooks of your ratchet straps off of your motorcycle to prevent scratching.  Ratchet straps are made for standard tie down applications and help keep your motorcycle firmly secured. , Pull the slack out of one strap and tighten it gently. Repeat the action on the other ratchet strap. Each strap needs to be pulled tight enough so the bike will be standing upright with the aid of the straps.  Every motorcycle is a little different, so make sure that the part you choose is a sturdy and structural component of the motorcycle, such as the frame. , Hook your ratchet straps to the soft loops on your motorcycle and to the bed of your truck or trailer.  Pull the slack from the straps and then pull them tight.  Make sure that each one is tight and hasn't become loose during the process of tying down your motorcycle.	Place a motorcycle wheel chock towards the front of your truck bed or trailer. Load your motorcycle into the truck bed or trailer. Push the front wheel into the motorcycle wheel chock.  , Wrap soft loops around the base of the left and right side handle bars. Hook your ratchet straps to the other end of your soft loops on the handle bars. Attach the other end of your ratchet straps to a secure point on your truck or trailer.  , Tighten your ratchet straps. Find a stable component on either side of the rear of your motorcycle. Wrap soft loops around each of your stable components on the rear of your motorcycle.  , Attach your ratchet straps. Tighten the ratchet straps on the back of the motorcycle. Double check all four straps.
Breathe slowly and deeply and try to think positively, once you have done this it will all be worth it!; , For example:   "It's not as bad as it looks. They have safety harnesses and the tracks are tested all the time to ensure they're safe. The restraints 'fail-safe' which means that the default position is locked, it takes more effort to open them! Perhaps even look up the statistics of injury on a rollercoaster, you will find that you are more likely to be struck by lightning of get hurt in a car accident! " "People scream because it's exciting scary, not bad scary." "It's only for a short time. Then I'll probably want to get back on and have another go because it's over so quickly, even if the worst case scenario happens and you hate it, it will only last for about 2 1/2 minutes. Then you have conquered it!"  , Tell yourself: "Well, I've made it now, it's going to be all right now that I'm on here." or "I've finally done it."  , This can help a lot to keep you calm and to have reassuring feedback from a person who is used to the rollercoaster or is able to deal with fears better.   Be careful not to choose someone as afraid as you. This can turn into a situation where you feed off each others fear and make things seem a whole lot worse!	Practice self calming techniques. Tell yourself things that confirm the fun and safety of using the rollercoaster. Praise yourself for getting on. Go with someone you trust.
Stir this mixture until it is thoroughly mixed together. Set it aside.       ; , Mix thoroughly until all of the Borax is dissolved.  Stir them together. Add several drops of food coloring until the mixture is the color you want it to be.  Close the bag, making sure it is tightly closed.

That's a way to lose two friends and if you're interested in that, then see this page-- https://www.wikihow.com/Lose-a-Boring-Friend-in-3-Days; , If anyone can recognize a flaw about you, don't let it be what you're wearing. Always look sophisticated and classy. Try setting trends, but nothing too outrageous. Remember: You are better than everyone else, therefore you must present yourself in that manner  , Miranda prefers phone numbers to be separated by periods (ex. 917.555.3345). You could do this as it's not a total steal from her, but find other things as well  , It sounds extremely shallow because it is. But you clicked on this article and Miranda is shallow. Always make little remarks about people's outfits or style.  Even if you're mad. Definitely put anger in your voice, but don't raise your voice. Just look intimidating. This is key. Miranda never raises her voice but that just makes her even scarier.  Also, if you are annoyed, then let it be known  , Do what you want (to an extent). Walk like you're on a RUNWAY.  No British accent required, but no street slang  , Just little snide comments  , Miranda is perfect (besides a slight attitude flaw).

Then, of course when he's gone, you may express your true, raging emotions for him.  Miranda has no friends, but she has power. I'm pretty sure that you have no power, being in High School, Middle School, or whatever else, so you need people to back you up. But, if you have some friends that you would like to get rid of, now is the time.  Don't be afraid to speak your mind, or express your opinions.	Don't be a total loser and ask two of your friends to be your assistants and then order them around. Be stylish. Find little quirky (or ridiculous) things to do. Always be judging everyone. Don't raise your voice. Make it a point to let others around you know how incompetent(a word she uses a lot) they are. Be extremely confident. Have a large vocabulary.

Keep your friends. Be bold.
This can be simple sometimes. Look for floor drains in the basement, and plumbing fixtures that don't get much use like guest baths, and laundry sinks. Over time the trap under these fixtures can go dry, thereby letting sewer gas in by losing the water seal. The fix is as simple as pouring a few cups of water in the trap. Now you know why the "U" shaped pipe under the sink is called a "trap"––it traps sewer gas in the drains!  Dry traps are sometimes hidden by carpets. Consider infrequently used sinks in basements. These can be a source of odor, so run water through them more regularly.; , Here are some typical odor source areas in the house (you may be able to check for these yourself but in some cases, it's best to ask the plumber to do it, especially if you're unsure).  Check old laundry drains no longer used. These should be capped off. Get your HVAC equipment serviced. If it's not working properly, it can be a source of odors. Check the shower drain. Odors can be caused when hair hangs on the strainer and touches the trap water. Look at the toilet. When the toilet wax seals have gone bad between the piping and the toilet base, odors can emerge. Consider vent areas. Clogged vents on the roof or in the yard can cause gas backup.  Improperly installed plumbing fixtures, such as no trap, can cause sewer odors.  Check for broken or leaking pipes in the basement or walls. A plumber can do this for you.  If you can, open the house to get the smell out, then close everything up and start in the basement and work your way up to find the where the odor begins.	Find the odor source. Look for other possible sources of the odors. Request a plumber's assessment of the installed plumbing fixtures. Let air flow through your home.
Start with bare wood.  Use an item such as the end of a high heel shoe or a hammer with a small chisel to make indentations on various places of the furniture piece. Don't overdo it; the furniture will look tacky if you add too much distressing.  The paint will need to be stirred frequently to keep it mixed properly.  Always paint using one complete stroke for each length painted.   Paint the trim first. Paint a base coat next. Paint quickly as the milk paint dries quickly.  Add 100 grit sandpaper to the sander. Locate areas where wear-and-tear would be most likely (corners, bumps, front areas) and sand over these areas.  Sand over the non-distressed areas with this grade of sandpaper to smooth.  Place rubber gloves on and old socks over the top. Rub the wax finish over the whole piece of furniture.   Excess wax should be removed immediately; scrub off with a plastic-bristle brush.	Strip off all remaining paint on the piece of furniture. Add any indentations you feel are necessary. In a large bucket, mix together 1 cup of milk paint with 2 parts water. Paint along the grain. Distress the surface. Add 300 grit sandpaper to the sander. Add a darker wax finish.
The thread should be fine and strong; silk or cotton are good natural choices while polyester thread is long-lasting.Place the needle and thread on the underside of the fabric where you intend sewing the sequin into place.   Match the thread to the color of the sequin rather than to the fabric.; ,, Draw it through the center of the sequin. Leave a long tail of thread on the underside.  Cross the thread over the top of the sequin. , The more that you sew, the faster this will become as you get used to the rhythm of going through the motions.   When sewing sequins in a row, be sure that they're not overlapping unless this is the final look you wish to achieve.	Begin with fine, long needle and suitable thread. Place the sequin with care on the top side of the fabric, sitting in the position that you want it to be.  , Bring the needle up through the fabric. Return to the backside of the fabric. Tie the ends of the thread together on the back side to create secure knot.  , Move on to the next sequin.
If you can't find any corn starch were you live, try searching for cornflour instead. This sand will be pure white if you don't add any color to it. It can look almost like snow!   If you plan on creating different colors or smells, separate the corn starch into different bowls.  It is much easier to mix dry ingredients with other dry ingredients. If you have any glitter, spices, or powdered colors that you want to add to your sand, do so now. Here are a few ways in which you can spruce up your sand:   Add in a few teaspoons of glitter to make your sand sparkle. If you are leaving your moon sand white, consider using white, iridescent glitter instead. Add in a few tablespoons of powered tempera paint, powdered watercolor, or powdered chalk to give your moon sand some color. Add in a packet of powdered drink mix, such as Kool Aid, to give your sand a nice scent and color. Sprinkle in some baking spices, such as apple pie, pumpkin pie, cinnamon, cocoa, or vanilla sugar to give your sand a nice smell. If you want to add any essential oils or oil-based food dyes, save those for later.  You will need ¾ cup of vegetable oil. Because oil and water do not mix, you cannot use any water-based coloring or dyes. Whatever you add to the oil must be oil-based.   If you can't find any powdered colors but still want to color your sand, add in a few drops of oil-based food coloring or oil-based candy coloring. Do not use plain old liquid food coloring; oil and water do not mix. If you can't find any spices that appeal to you, but still want to make your sand smell nice, add in a few drops of essential oil or baking extract, such as: vanilla, almond, or orange.  If it seems a little on the dry side, add a tablespoon or two of vegetable at a time to loosen it up. If it is too wet, add some more corn starch.   The main advantage to this recipe is that these two ingredients combined make a moon sand that looks like snow. Only it's not cold, wet, and doesn't turn to black the more you play in it.  Once everything's in, put your hands in and start being creative. How do the colors combine? What's it feel like? Ask more questions to get your child engaged in sensory play, which moon sand is notoriously great for., After your child has gotten his or her fill (and you have, too, of course), transport the moon sand into an air-tight, resealable container. Keep it in a cool, dry location, like in a closet, under the bed, or in a toy box.   When you go to play with it again (it keeps a few months, though it's cheap enough you could always make a new batch), bring it back to life with a few tablespoons of water. Start molding the sand with your hands to work the water in, and it'll be good as new in no time.	Pour 4 cups of corn starch into a large bowl. Mix in any glitter, scents, or powdered colors to the corn starch, if desired. Mix in any oil-based dyes or essential oils to the vegetable oil, if desired. Mix the vegetable oil into the corn starch to keep it looking like snow. Mix it up well and start play time. Keep it in an air-tight container.
The Red Cross or similar organizations will often distribute cleanup kits after a disaster. These contain many useful items such as a broom, mop, bucket, and cleaning supplies. In most cases, household cleaning products will do the job if you use them correctly. Check the label on the products to see how much to use. After cleaning a room or item, go over it again with a disinfectant to kill the germs and smell left by the flood waters.  A two bucket approach is most efficient: use one bucket for rinse water and the other for the cleaner. Rinse out your sponge, mop, or cleaning cloth in the rinse bucket.   Start cleaning a wall at the bottom or where the worst damage was. If you have removed the wallboard or plaster, wash the studs and sills and disinfect them. If you taped your windows before the storm, clean the tape off as soon as possible. The sun will bake the adhesive into the glass. Use orange or eucalyptus oil to help remove the sticky leftovers. Don’t try to force open swollen wooden doors and drawers. Take off the back of the piece of furniture to let the air circulate. You'll probably be able to open the drawers after they dry.  There’s an unexpected danger of shock with some electrical appliances such as TV sets and radios. Certain internal parts store electricity even when the appliance is unplugged. Check the back for a warning label.   Even if your washing machine did not get wet, do not use it until you know that the water is safe enough to drink and that your sewer line works. Throw out soft plastic and porous items that probably absorbed whatever the flood waters carried in. Like the washing machine, the dishwasher should also be used only after you know your water is safe to drink and your sewer line works.  Even food in tin cans should be discarded if the cans got wet during the flood because there is no way to be absolutely certain the food inside is safe. Do not keep food in bottles or jars with bottle caps or screw on lids—they do not keep out flood waters.  Valuable papers such as books, photographs, and stamp collections can be restored with a great deal of effort. They can be rinsed and frozen (in a frost-free freezer or commercial meat locker) until you have time to work on them.  As you get rid of things from your home, don’t turn your yard into a dump. Food and garbage must be hauled away as soon as possible.   Mosquitoes can carry many diseases, and a flood can create ideal conditions for them to breed. Drain or remove standing water that can become a breeding ground. Dump water out of barrels, old tires, and cans. Check that your gutters are clean and can drain. Ditches and drains also need to be cleaned so they can carry storm water away from your home. Lawns usually survive being underwater for up to four days. Salt water should be hosed off the lawn and shrubs.	Get hold of cleaning equipment. Tackle one room at a time. Take care with appliances. Throw any food out that has been touched by flood waters. Try to restore valuables. Keep the house clean.
If the fire is rapidly approaching, you may not have time to take any precautions to protect the structure. However, if time permits, there are a number of things you can do to keep the building as safe as possible.   Shut off any and all fuel lines, including propane, natural gas, and oil.Move curtains and fabric-covered furniture away from windows and sliding doors. If the glass breaks, you do not want anything flammable near the window/door.Remove any combustible objects from the yard, especially gas grills and fuel cans, and discard them as far from your structure and any nearby structures as possible.You should also move any stacks of firewood as far from the building as possible.If time permits, trim grass and vegetation as low to the ground as possible around the building and any external propane tanks. This will help reduce the combustible material that would allow the fire to reach you or the fuel source., If the building has hoses and running water, utilize that water to create a safer structure. Remember that water may not necessarily stop a fire, but it will slow it down.   Use hoses or sprinklers to saturate the roof of the building, the walls, and the ground immediately surrounding the building.Fill any large containers present with water (if possible), and surround the perimeter of the building with them., Whether you become trapped in your home or you take shelter in a building you come across, stay inside no matter what. If the fire surrounds the building, you're more likely to survive inside than out.Close all the doors, windows, and vents in the building to prevent a draft from spreading the fire inside.Do not lock the doors to the building. If things take a turn for the worst and you need to escape, or if firefighters find the building, you'll want to ensure that the doors are not locked.Stay away from exterior walls. If the building is big enough, try to get into the middle of the structure, like a centrally-located room, so that you are as far from the exterior as possible. If you are with other people, stay together.	Take any precautions you can. Try to wet the area. Stay inside.
Most modern wet cell batteries are sealed and considered “maintenance free,” but ones that are not sealed will require occasional service. You can usually easily identify if your battery is sealed or not by looking for rectangular ports on the top of the battery. If there are ports, the battery can be opened and requires maintenance to continue working properly.If there are no ports, the battery is sealed and does not require service. Never open the ports without first putting on the appropriate safety gear.  If your battery does require occasional service, you may need to add water to it from time to time to keep it functioning properly. Batteries that are charged and depleted often or operating in high temperature areas will likely require service more often than those that are not. First, check the water levels in the battery, then add distilled water if it is required. Never service your battery without first putting on eye protection and gloves as the fluid inside is corrosive.Remember, many wet cell and all VRLA batteries do not require you to add water at any time. Always use distilled water when adding fluid to your battery.  Keeping your batteries charged will help prolong their lifespan and ensure your RV works just the way you want it to when you take it out. Some people choose to remove the batteries from their RVs while storing them, but that isn’t necessary. Plug your RV batteries into a battery maintainer or trickle charger with a storage setting. Never plug any of your RVs batteries into a trickle charger that does not have a maintenance or storage setting, as you run the risk of overcharging them.Your deep cycle and starter batteries can be stored and charged using the same methods. Make sure the voltage output on the trickle charger or maintainer you choose matches the voltage of the battery or you risk damaging the battery.  After your battery has been plugged into a maintainer or charger for a week, check on it to ensure it isn’t overcharging. If the battery is warm to the touch or requires fluid be added to it, the charger you chose is introducing too much electricity into the battery. Slight overcharging can reduce the battery’s lifespan, and significant overcharging can cook the battery’s internals and prevent it from holding a charge at all.If the battery seems to be overcharging, disconnect it immediately. Clerks at most auto parts stores can help you match a trickle charger to the battery you intend to charge.  Some wet cell deep cycle batteries require equalizing if left for several months without charging. Equalizing a deep cycle battery involves using a high voltage charger at a low current level to break the sulfate crystals off of the inner cells. Doing so requires a special charger and should be done by professionals.Most wet cell, deep cycle batteries do not require equalization. If you are unsure if yours does, check on the manufacturer’s website. No VRLA batteries require equalization.	Assess whether or not your wet cell batteries require service. Add distilled water to your battery if necessary. Charge your batteries when stored. Check for overcharging. Equalize deep cycle batteries if necessary.
If possible, try not to go for a theme. You like lots of different things,so your room revolving around just one thing will only make things difficult! An idea is to have a base colour, namely on your walls, and other colours around your room. Make a plan of the way your furniture will be laid out too. If you want a theme go for a theme that covers a lot of different interests. Ex: Get a modern bedspread and light then decorate with silver and blue.; , A sunny kinda girl? Maybe yellow or creamy white suits you best. Outgoing and confident? A light green or blue is for you. Girly and creative? Pink or purple?!  ,, Some examples are:   Music Art Films Animals, etc.  It will come in handy later!  , Find good positions and make sure none of your furniture covers anything you want to see, i.e., a window. Empty stuff like desks and drawers before moving. Lay contents on bed and put back when finished. Donate anything you don't want to the charity shop and throw away anything which is too mucked up to keep. Empty your bin,too.  It may sound boring but can actually be fun if you think positive and how great your room will look afterwards! Dust, wipe, vacuum...do anything you can.  The fun part! Find a brilliant duvet, curtains, cushions...anything to give your room that relaxed and cozy feel. Change your sheets if necessary.  Put make up and hair stuff on drawers and your stationary and files on your desk,or in the drawers if you have any in them.  Use shelves and storage to contain everything! How about displaying all your collections too? Put all your books on bookshelves. How about some teddies on a nearby shelf? Get organized.  Put up your fave posters and frame photos. Use a noticeboard for reminders and show your favourite art. Put up pics of your fave music stars (look at your list for inspiration). Get a fountain light or fairy lights to make your room magical. Use your imagination and add anything else!  ,	Decide what you want your room to appear as. If you're allowed to, find a colour you love for your walls. Always take good care when painting and cover everything up.  , Think about your interests. Write a list down. Start to move your furniture. Tidy!, So you've got all the other stuff out of the way.Guess what comes next?, Arrange your stuff. Find nice ways to display your things. And at last, for the final part, accessories!, Stand back and admire your new room.
You can use crunch stitch to make all sorts of things, but the crunch stitch is great for making washcloths because of the bumpy texture. Making a crunch stitch washcloth is easy and you only need a few items to do it. You will need:Cotton yarn in the color of your choice Size H crochet hook Scissors  , Make a chain of 26 stitches to start your crunch stitch washcloth.You will be working this chain in the crunch stitch.   This chain size will make an approximately 8 inch square washcloth. If you want your washcloth to be larger or smaller, adjust the number of stitches according to your yarn gauge.  Start by doing a slipstitch into the second chain from the hook.After the slipstitch, use a double crochet stitch on the next stitch.Repeat this pattern to end of row. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and half-double crochet stitches until the end of the first row., When your reach the end of the row, turn the stitches around and chain two stitches.This will be your turning chain for your second row. You will need to make a turning chain for every even row until you complete the washcloth.  After you chain two new stitches, slipstitch into the first stitch in the row and then follow with a half-double crochet. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and HDC to the end of the row., For the third row and all odd rows after this one, start with a slipstitch. Do not chain two at the start of this row. Just slipstitch and then follow with a half-double crochet.Turn when you reach the end of the row and then repeat the pattern that you used for row two.   Alternate between rows two and three until washcloth measures 8 inches.,	Gather your materials. Chain 26 stitches. Slipstitch and then HDC. Turn and chain two stitches. Slipstitch and half-double crochet to the end of the row. Start row three with a slipstitch and then follow with half-double crochet. Finished.
This is the most common sign. The light is much,much brighter than it usually is, that means it is within minutes of burning out.; ,, The light is dimmer than usual, or doesn't turn on. It could be that it blown out already, you are too late.  The light takes a long time to start up. This means either a bad electricity current, or that it is going to burn out immediately.  The light flickers, this may mean it is badly connected/screwed in, or that the connection is connecting, and splitting, probably already burned out.  A fluctuating brightness definitely means it is about to blow up. Disconnect or switch off immediately.	Watch for an increase in light brightness. Listen: A strange squealing will come from the bulb, or a buzz, this signifies vibration that can cause the connection to break and fail.  , Notice dimming. Observe how long it takes for the light to start up. Watch for flickering. Notice for light fluctuations.
; , Crepe myrtle needs full sun to thrive, so the location you choose should receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day on average.  These trees grow best in loose, well-drained soil. Clear a spot that is about 3 feet by 3 feet (1 yard by 1 yard). Loosen the soil in that spot by chopping it up with a rake or shovel.  If you have heavy soil, you may need to mix a little peat moss or garden sand into the soil to improve its drainage properties. You can also mix in compost or a slow-release fertilizer, but if you do, you should make sure to mix the additive thoroughly to the entire plant bed. Uneven pockets of nutrients in the soil can cause the roots to develop poorly.  Crepe myrtle thrive in soil that is neutral to slightly acidic, about 6.0 to 7.3. If you need to decrease the pH, mix in additional organic matter like compost or manure. If you need to increase the pH, mix in agricultural lime.  The hole should be twice as wide as the root ball, but it should be about the same depth as the nursery pot holding the plant. Avoid planting the root ball any deeper than that since the soil around the root ball needs to stay oxygenated. For best results, the root ball should be about level with the soil.  Lightly pack the soil around the base of the tree. The soil should be heavy and packed enough to help hold the young tree in place, but it should still be fairly loose to allow the roots room to grow.	Plant the crepe myrtle during a dormant season.Early spring is generally considered best, but you can also plant the tree during fall or winter, as long as you live in a region where the winters are mild and the ground does not freeze. Choose a sunny location. Till the soil. Amend the soil. Test the pH of the soil. Dig a large hole and place the root ball inside. Fill the hole in with soil.
This will be late spring/early summer. Later in the summer after the leaves have disappeared a shoot will appear very quickly (sometimes practically overnight).  Return one portion to the original place and then move the rest to their new homes in the garden.  When returning the bulbs to the ground, be sure to place two-thirds of the bulb under the ground.  Don't be surprised if they don't flower the next season. The disruption may have been too much and the bulb might need time to recuperate.   Note that this plant may flower while completely void of a leaf vegetation.	Wait for the lily leaves to die off. Lift the clump out of the ground and divide gently. Replant. Await new flowering.
Draw a large circle (the body) and then a smaller circle on top of it (the head). Make sure that the two circles overlap a bit. Draw a light line halfway through the head.; , On the sides of the body, draw two "C" shapes. These will be the feet. In the middle, draw small circles for the pads of his feet.  Add two small "C" shapes on the sides of the head for his ears. Just below the halfway line that you drew in step 1, draw two tiny ovals as eyes. Below the eyes, draw a circle for the snout, overlapping it a tiny bit on the body. Draw a smaller half-circle at the top of the snout. This is his nose.  On the sides of his body, draw two lines going down to the feet (the arms). On the left side, draw a circle for his hand. On the right side, leave it as-is.  Add fuzz and fur around his body, then draw his eyebrows about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) above his eyes. Draw a patch just below his right eyebrow. Draw a stitching line in the middle of his body, then draw another patch to the right of that.  Erase all of the guidelines and colour him in. Now you have your own Tatty Teddy!	Draw the head and body. Draw the feet. Add the face. Add the arms. Add the finishing touches. Finish the drawing.
A disassembled flute is divided into three pieces of different sizes. You’ll need to learn which is which before you can put your flute together.The headjoint is the top part of the flute, which has the lip plate. The body of the flute is the central portion, and the largest, with several keys on it. The footjoint is the smallest part, forming the bottom of the flute.; , Take the parts of your flute out of the case, one by one. Lift them by their ends only, to avoid damaging them. As you take the parts out of the case, give them a quick wipe down with a polishing cloth to clean them so they’ll fit together properly.   Pay special attention to the ends of the pieces--making sure they are free from dirt will help the flute fit together properly.  Gently hold the headjoint in one hand and the body in another. Insert the end opposite the lip plate of the headjoint into the end of the body that is bare metal, not covered by keys. You'll want to bring the pieces together with a slight twisting motion.If you're having trouble bringing the pieces together, don't force it. Wipe the joints of the pieces with your cloth and try again. Take care to hold the pieces gently, by the ends, not by the keys. If you forcefully grab them as you twist, you might damage your instrument.  If you have a beginner’s flute, you might see that it has little arrow markings where the pieces come together. If you see those, just gently twist the body and the headjoint until the arrows line up. Even if your flute doesn't have markings, it's not difficult to line the pieces up: just gently twist until the hole on the lip plate is centered with the keys on the body., Bring the foot joint and the body together at their joints, again with a slight twisting motion. Gently turn until the first key on the foot joint is slightly to the right of the keys on the body.   Keep the pieces straight as they come together. Attaching them at an angle may damage your flute. Some flautists find it helpful to gently press the low C and C# keys with their thumb as the attach the footjoint to the body., Once all the pieces of your flute are assembled, play it a bit to make sure it is in tune and put together properly. If something looks, feels, or sounds off, stop and make adjustments as needed.    Use a tuner to help determine if you are hitting notes correctly. There are many convenient electronic tuners you can try., When you are done playing your flute, you should first give it a quick wipe down with your cloth to help keep it clean. Next, take it apart by using the same gentle twisting motions as you did when assembling. Holding each piece by the ends, place them one by one back into the flute’s case., If you are ever unsure if you are assembling your flute correctly, ask your teacher for more guidance. They can give you pointers and watch as you assemble your flute to make sure you are doing it correctly., The joints of a flute are designed to fit snugly for proper tone and intonation. You might think that adding some kind of lubrication will make it easier to assemble the flute, but this can actually cause your flute to play and sound incorrectly. Avoid putting any kind of oil or other lubrication on your flute when assembling it., Always be gentle when assembling your flute. Don’t put your fingers on the moving parts when putting the joints together (unless you are lightly pressing the C keys when putting the footjoint and body together). Use a light touch and gentle twisting motions to fit the joints together, rather than grasping the flute pieces in your hand. Following these guidelines will prevent you from damaging your flute., Keeping your flute clean is important for maintaining the instrument, and it’s convenient to do so when you’re assembling it. Use a polishing cloth (sometimes called a “silver cloth”) available from a music store. Gently wiping the flute and swabbing moisture from the insides when you disassemble it will be sufficient for everyday cleaning.	Open your flute case. Unpack and clean your flute pieces. Bring the headjoint and the body together. Line up the lip plate and the keys. Attach the foot joint to body. Test your flute. Disassemble your flute carefully. Ask for help if you need it. Do not use lubrication. Handle the flute parts with care. Swab and clean your flute regularly.
This is the most important step of redecorating because it allows you not to spend excessively on things you don't really need. Your budget should only be a rough estimate, however.; ,: painting your existing wardrobe). If you want to totally start over, be aware that it will cost more.  There's no use in throwing something out unless it is entirely unusable, such as an old, rotting basket.  It is really much better to have at two windows, one large and one small in your bedroom. If there still isn't enough light but you can't afford lighting options like sconces, than try getting a very tall floor lamp that either has a wide, circular top that points to the ceiling or a floor lamp with three lamps attached to it.  Some essentials that most people have and that I would recommend are: a large bookcase, an armoire/dresser, a vanity (if you are a girl), a large table, a nightstand, a chest to store your things in, a new mattress, sheet set, bed, new paint, three lamps, and three chairs. Remember that you could probably find a lot of stuff in the attic or basement.  A queen size bed is a good size, because not only will there be a lot of space, there are also many more sheet sets and blankets that size than Full or Twin. It also costs less than King, but if you don't have the money or space, then just get a Twin. (To clear up any confusion, a bed is not the sheet set, blankets, pillows, and mattress altogether. It is just a frame to put the bed on.)  , Some stores that people like are Ethan Allen, Home Depot, and Benjamin Moore. It all depends on your budget and your tastes.  This is almost always one of the fun parts. You could have a calm beach feel, a light, pink romantic theme, an autumnal feel, and many more. You can find a lot of them in an Ethan Allen catalog. If you don't want a theme, you don't have to have one, but a theme makes everything in your room come together. It doesn't have to be complicated, you could just have a simple colour scheme or a particular feel, like modern or classy. Another option is to have small themes all throughout the room, like polka-dot curtains and bedding and an ocean-themed desk and bookcase. Some themes complement each other, like polka dots and floral, while others look garish with each other, like stripes & stripes. Make sure your theme isn't too crowded or else your eyes will hurt.  This will tell where everything goes in your room, and is very important. You don't need anything fancy, just a simple sketch.  While the walls get painted, ask for the painters to also paint any furniture you want to paint.  It's the first thing that people look at when they enter your room, so you have to make sure you get good bedding and a blanket/duvet that goes with it. A toss pillow or two couldn't hurt, either.  This is because you need to know whether the bed will go with the bedding or not. Wooden beds look simple and country-style, while iron beds look elegant and sophisticated. Both can look modern if painted black.  You may want to have only curtains, curtains and sheers, only sheers, only shades, or only curtains and shades. Sheers are a good choice because they cost less, look good, and they filter light while offering privacy. Country Curtains is very good for curtains and sheers, while Smith and Noble is good for shades.  The lamps can look Asian, modern, elegant, etc. Chandeliers are very sophisticated, but simple ceiling lighting with white shades look modern.  Dressers take up more room and are better for girls, as there is usually a mirror above one. However, armoires are good for both genders, takes up less space, and in my opinion, look better. If you have an armoire and are a girl, consider buying a vanity.  The chest can be tall or short like a dresser. You could use a nightstand as a chest if you want.  The nightstand could be a cross between a vanity/nightstand, having a mirror on the top, one drawer, and a chair.  They can just be plain old tables and bookshelves, because they are only there for function, unless you really want a nice table/bookshelf.	Decide on a budget. Look around your room and write down what you want to keep, even if you would like to improve an item you already have (i.e. All the things that you don't want to keep, give them to a sibling, charity, or sell them. Think about lighting options, such as chandeliers, lamps, sconces, and windows. Decide what new things you want. Decide what size bed you are getting. Think about what companies you trust for your furniture/paint. Choose a theme. Make a room plan. Get the walls painted first, you need to figure out whether the bedding will work with it or not. Buy the bedding theme. After buying the bedding, buy the mattress/bed. Buy the curtains/shades. If everything coordinates, buy new lighting. Buy an armoire/dresser. Buy the chest if you want. Buy a nightstand if you want. Buy the bookshelf and table. Finally buy the accents, and voila-you're done!
Leave 1/2" (1 cm or so) extra on all sides, stopping just below your second knuckle. This is the template for your finger puppet.  You'll need two of your template (front and back) plus any extra bits. Wings for your butterfly? A nose for your elephant? A beak for your chicken? Ears for your rabbit? Get as intricately detailed as possible.   If your brain isn't firing on all pistons at the moment, look up a few generic cartoons for detailing inspiration.  Before you get to sewing the base of the puppet, sew on all the small, finer details. While you have your thread out, sew on a grin with a backstitch.   A whip stitch will probably be best for adding your eyes/nose/beak/wings/general details. If sewing isn't your forte, you may be able to get around most of it with hot glue. But take care -- glue and felt isn't always pretty, especially if too much glue is used.  Do a blanket stitch around the entire body; if you've added a piece that doesn't allow for this, switch to a running stitch.   Now all you've got to do is put 'em on and get to creating. Unless you want to give your puppet 9 more friends, of course!	Trace your finger on a piece of paper. Cut out your felt pieces. Sew on the additions. Place the top and bottom of the body on top of each other and sew together.
If you want it to be Christmas-related, a snowman or pine tree might work. If it's for a birthday, try a small toy. For a personalized snow globe, try a heavily laminated photo, glued to a cork or another base.Make sure your figure is waterproof and fits on the jar lid and inside the jar. Ensure there's a good flat surface to glue down.Ceramic or plastic are good bets. If you're not sure, place your figurine in a bowl of water for a few hours and see if anything happens. You can also make your own figure out of sculpey clay. It's easy to find in craft stores and comes in a variety of colors.; , Any size can work, from a baby food jar to a spaghetti sauce jar to a large mason jar. Make sure there are no cracks and that it can be closed tightly.   Test out the seal on your jar ahead of time. Fill it with water, close it tightly and turn it over—nothing should leak out. Wash your jar with hot, soapy water, remove any labels or glue remaining, and make sure it's totally dry before proceeding. You'll also need a place your craft can dry overnight, undisturbed. Once you've got a figure and a jar, try placing it in different positions to figure out what looks best and which side you should glue down., Most craft stores or general retailers will have anything you don't already have at home. Besides a jar and a figurine, you'll also need:   Waterproof craft glue or epoxy Glitter or fake snow Bottled water, which is less likely to cloud up Glycerin or baby oil (optional, but it thickens the water and makes the “snow” fall more slowly)  , Remove the lid from your jar and find out where you want to place your figurine. Model it in different positions and try the jar over top. Once you have found the right pose, apply your adhesive sealant to the bottom of the figurine. Then, press the figurine down onto the lid, and hold it for about 2-5 seconds depending on the size.  It could take up to 24 hours, but check your glue packaging for drying times. Find a place to set it where it won't be disturbed. Make sure the figurine on your lid is nice and secure before proceeding.  Bottled water is ideal and will be clearer. Leave a little room at the top for glycerin, glitter and space for your figurine.  Use a few drops to about a teaspoon, depending on how big your jar is. Glycerin is optional, but will let your glitter or "snow" fall down more slowly. Baby oil should accomplish the same thing., Using plastic glitter, sprinkle 1-2 teaspoons into the water. You may want to use more for a bigger jar, but don't overdo it or your snow globe will look hazy. Use a long-handled spoon to mix well. , Keeping the glass jar right side up, just place your lid onto the top of the jar, and seal it. If there's any extra water, it might leak a little, but that's okay. Turn it over gently and see if there are any leaks. Check for extra space at the top, too, and turn the jar back over and add a little more water if needed.   Let it sit for a few days to make sure there are no slow leaks or problems. Once you're sure everything is good, you may want to glue your jar shut permanently with epoxy or hot glue.  Shake your snow globe gently and enjoy your lovely craft! Display it on a windowsill, bookshelf or anywhere else you'd like to show off your handiwork.	Pick a theme. Find a good jar. Gather your supplies. Position your figurine. Let it dry. Fill the jar with water. Add the glycerin. Pour in some glitter. Seal the lid. Shake it up.
It's best to keep a party like this informal, and perhaps even a drop-in occasion to let people come and go as they please. Send out email and text invitations or simply call people and ask them over.   Encourage everyone to wear their favorite sporting gear, to add to the sporty theme of the party. If anyone is coming back from playing sport that day, ask them to stay in that mode!; , Look for Olympic themed decorations and use the five Olympic colors (blue, yellow, black, green and red) for color themes. Print out the Olympic mascot to pin up here and there, add some balloons and streamers and perhaps add a few print-outs of a few fun Olympics achievements statistics for people to read as they're seated. If any Olympic athlete that you have been following devotedly has achieved something amazing in the Olympics, why not print out his or her photo and display it proudly as well.  Everyone will want to watch the ceremony at various points during the party, if not the entire time, so have plenty of room for all guests in front of the screen. Set out extra chairs, cushions, and other seats to make it comfortable for everyone.   Does the TV's sound travel well? If not, you might need to get some additional speakers to make sure the sound can reach everyone. Include small areas to rest drinks and snacks, such as coffee tables, small tables, boxes, etc. It can be awkward if guests can't set down drinks and plates. If you have too many guests and not enough space in one area, consider using other areas that have TVs or borrow a friend's extra TV to set up another room. This might be a good way to keep noisier kids happy in one room while the adults watch more peacefully in another.  The easiest style for a sports party is usually buffet style, with occasional snacks being handed around as well. While you could go to the trouble of making food with a theme, such as your country's national colors, the shapes of various sporting gear, etc., you don't have to. Party food of all sorts will work well. Suggestions include:   Dips and chips, finger food, cheese and crackers, bowls of nibbles, spiced nuts, etc. If you don't have any of the other food suggestions below, at least have snack foods available. Sliced meats, savory pies, buffalo wings, pizza, curries, etc. for savory foods. Include plates and cutlery for serving and eating with. Cupcakes, doughnuts/churros, whoopie pies, dessert pies, cookies, cheesecake, candies, etc. for sweet foods. Healthy foods like salads, fruit kebabs, sugar- or gluten-free options, etc. If you want to make Olympic themed food, try such approaches as using the Olympic colors, turning items like bagels, pizzas or cookies into the Olympic rings, decorating cakes and pies with sporting themes, etc.  The usual drinks from lemonade and sodas to beer and wine are good choices. If you want something fancier, consider making Jell-O shots, cocktails/mocktails, mixed drinks and alcohol-pops.  Hold small races (running, sack races, egg and spoon races, etc.), set up a mini obstacle course or hurdles, have target throwing practice for prizes, play ball games, throw paper planes or other paper objects over distances, and if you have a pool, perhaps include supervised swimming races or even synchronized swimming! If adults get involved, simply make the games harder or challenge them to a tug of war, which was once an actual Olympic event.   Encourage teams if there are lots of kids, or if the adults would like to join in. Have each team develop its own mascot (give them paper, stuffed toys, markers, etc. to do this with). Set out an area with soft mats for anyone who is good at gymnastics or who simply wants to try out some cartwheels and handstands. Award the children with medals for their wins. These could be made from cardboard, paper, etc. attached to ribbon, or you could use chocolate coins attached to a ribbon.  Some of the party guests might enjoy testing their wits about all things Olympic. There are several possible approaches to this:   Run a pub-style quiz that only uses the Olympics for the subject-matter. Play Trivial Pursuit but replace the cards with your own Olympic themed ones. This would be a lot of effort though! Make a pass-the-parcel that can only have each layer opened upon answering an Olympic-related question. Simply ask Olympic-related questions for on-the-spot prizes throughout the party.	Invite everyone you'd like to come. Decorate the room where the party is held. Make the largest screen in your home the focal point for the party. Serve a buffet. Include drinks. Consider having a mini Olympic Games in the backyard to keep the kids entertained. Hold an Olympics trivia quiz.
Do you want to build a recording studio? Is it a singing booth? Is it an engineering booth? Is it for computer-based music production? Knowing what you want before you start can help you decide which equipment you will need. Doing extensive research will help at this stage. Try to find a specialist at PC World, or your local Apple shop, take notes and then find more information on the Internet.; , This will include such items as amplifiers, microphones, mixers, electric instruments, cables for connecting it all together. A modern computer built or purchased within the past three years should be sufficient.   If possible, acquire a working high-quality soundcard, such as an M-Audio Fast Track Pro or Digidesign Mbox 2 Mini. Creative Labs does have a Pro Music line called EMU. A 1212M PCI system is ideal if you were going to go that route. Monitor speakers are helpful if you are looking to stick with this for more than a hobby. The M-Audio Studiophile BX8a's, KRK RP-8 Rokit work well, and if you've got money to burn, the Mackie HR824 Studio Monitors. If you're into hip-hop, techno, or dance music, a set of turntables will be needed to record your sets or scratches on the fly. You can also use DJ software such as Traktor or Serato and a USB DJ controller to try out your mixes. A midi keyboard will be useful if you want to use midi software (which you can use to write bass lines, piano parts, and drum beats). Nothing fancy is needed, but each person will have their own preference. There are many advantages to having a midi keyboard because it will give you the tactile feel of a real instrument, which can greatly aid creativity. , This is where most of the genius (and perspiration!) comes in. In general, keep it as simple as possible. For best playback quality run from the sound card into a mixer or amplifier and then to your monitor speakers. For best recording quality, run instruments/mics into a mixer(make sure you are getting a perfect signal) then run from the mixer into the sound card.  Also learn how to turn an arrangement into a .wav or .mp3 file. (After all, eventually we want to make a CD with all this awesome music!)  , Sound-proof it if possible. If not, try to use special carpet or insulation that can at least reduce external noise.  Start off with a drumbeat. Add a bass line or piano or vocal track. Start mixing. Explore! It's all about experimentation. At the beginning, you don't have to write a masterpiece - just focus on having fun!  , It will help you understand the underlying concepts needed to keep you going for a lifetime.  Lay a bunch of tracks together. Experiment with processed effects. Experiment with plugins, loops, new hardware and anything else you can get your hands onto.	Write a plan of what you want to do. Acquire the appropriate equipment. Buy or download music-editing software for your PC.  , Connect everything up. Learn how to record a sound from an input line and how to arrange pre-recorded sounds. Select a room in your house. Start writing simple tracks. If you have trouble with any of the above, pick up a Mixing / Studio Book. Once you've learned the basics, start breaking it down.
Strategies that address the problems in a given area must be mapped out. From the outset, it is essential to facilitate neighbors working together. This effort provides an opportunity for neighbors to meet and get to know each other, something that has become less common lately. Yet, it is crucial to include neighborhood involvement for the process to be successful.   In addition to not being familiar with your neighbors, the dilemma is compounded by the fact that many adults in vulnerable neighborhoods work multiple jobs frequently with odd hours, making it extraordinarily difficult to schedule meetings and organize events. This environment also makes it challenging for neighbors to get to know and care about one another in a way that would encourage them to watch out for each other but you need to find compromises to get them together, even if it's a series of meetings at different times.      ; , This is often the most difficult step to hurdle because there is usually angst between the residents and law enforcement for the existing crime problem that exists in their community.  Neighborhood Watch in the USA states, “In many cases, law enforcement and community members do not have the same focus. For instance, law enforcement may be focusing their attention on a problem that the neighborhood is not concerned about, such as attempting to address major crimes throughout the city. On the other hand, community members may be more concerned about crimes such as bicycle thefts or graffiti, which are considered minor from a police standpoint.” An effective Neighborhood Arson Watch program will combine the needs of the fire and police departments with those of the neighborhood when determining which problems to focus on and the methods used to address them.  If the group leaders are devoid of motivation and organization, the volunteers may be uninspired to participate and will quickly quit out of disappointment and frustration. Select the leaders wisely and give the leaders reasons to be proud of their role.  Often, after a Neighborhood Watch has addressed its original issue, members lose interest. It is important for leaders to remain passionate and committed for the long term. One way to accomplish this is to design new projects so that there is always a goal towards which the team of volunteers is aspiring. Arson prevention projects should focus on identifying and removing what could burn or materials that an arsonist could use to start a fire, such as:   Clean up the neighborhood by removing all garbage, material, and excess vegetation that is capable of being ignited.       Remove all possible sources of ignition such as flammable liquids and unused gas containers.       Remove abandoned vehicles. According to the USFA’s NFIRS data and the NFPA, there is an annual estimated average of 25,328 intentional fires involving vehicles.Most car fires are started to cover up other criminal activity or simply as an act of vandalism. An abandoned car is a target for arson.       Secure abandoned and vacant homes which are potential arson targets. This may be comprised with additional locks or the boarding up of broken windows or other openings with plywood. Communicate with the owner that authorities are concerned about the vacant home and explain why.       Encourage the fire department to conduct frequent fire code inspections.       Contact public works to disconnect all utilities at the street. This includes natural gas, water, and electricity. If there are liquefied petroleum gas tanks, they should be disconnected and removed.       Encourage Neighborhood Watch members to patrol these areas and write down descriptions, license plates of suspicious vehicles, and potential suspect descriptions.	Analyze the specific local problem and collect related data. Build a partnership between fire and emergency services, the police and other law enforcement agencies, and the residents. Assess the needs of a given neighborhood and in the case of arson, how the fire and police departments can work with the residents. Set up a Neighborhood Watch program by choosing and training a dynamic group of volunteers that are led by organized and motivated leaders. Develop meaningful projects specific to the identified problem.
You might have found a beautiful piece of sea glass while walking the beach, or maybe you have a semi-precious stone that you think just breathtaking, but either can make a beautiful piece of wire wrap art.Symmetrical shapes can give your wire wrap a more professional look, but sometimes interesting shapes can further accentuate the centerpiece around which you will wrap your wire.   For the purposes of this example, a round, polished stone bead will be used. However, the principles of wire wrapping described can be applied to many differently shaped centerpieces.; , Wire comes in many different varieties, both in terms of the material its made and its thickness, which is commonly referred to as the "gauge" of the wire. Larger and heavier centerpieces will require a thicker gauge of wire. All wire used in this example is either 20 or 22-gauge, which is frequently recommended for beginners.   The lower gauge your wire, the thicker it is. For example, 8-gauge wire is very thick, while 26-gauge wire is quite thin.You might consider using copper jewelry wire for your first wire wrap. Copper has a lovely color that compliments many different kinds of centerpiece, and is also relatively cheap. Once you feel comfortable with your wire wrapping skills, you might use fine silver, sterling silver, gold plated, or gold filled jewelry wire., In this example of wire wrapping, a round, polished stone bead is used as the centerpiece and is wrapped in an inexpensive brass wire. Most of these supplies should be available at your local hardware or craft store, or even online. For this project, you'll need:   20-gauge square soft wire (4' (1.2 m)) 22-gauge half-round hard wire (1' (30 cm)) 22-gauge square hard wire (4½" (11.5 cm)) A faceted stone Eye protection Felt-tip pen Flat-nose pliers Neck chain (or other fastener) Penknife (or comparably thin knife) Round-nose pliers Ruler Tape Wire cutter  , You'll want to clear any obstacles that might get in your way and make working with your wire difficult. Clear a broad area; while you are trying to cut or bend a longer piece of wire, you don't want to accidentally knock something over with the loose end.   Consider making use of a work bench, craft table, or laying down a drop cloth where you are working. While shaping and cutting the metal wire, sharp pieces can fly or flake off. A drop cloth will make cleanup much easier.  For centerpieces that are bulky or larger, you might need to measure out more wire. The central frame of your wire wrap should be:   Long enough to warp around the perimeter of your centerpiece. Thick enough to hold your centerpiece. Heavy/bulky centerpieces might require you to use more than six piece of wire.  Line up the wires and draw them tightly together, making sure each is parallel to the others. Then should use your tape to bind the ends. This will keep your bundle in shape while you work with the wire.   Depending on the contour of your centerpiece, you may find a rounded wire frame works best. In this example, the wire frame has been flattened to better contain the polished bead centerpiece.  Now, with your felt-tip pen, you should mark this point.  Use your wire cutters to snip free a five inch (13 cm) piece of 22-gauge half-round hard wire.  Use your flat-nosed pliers to grasp the piece of 22-gauge wire you cut free, then bend the wire around the bundle. After each winding, pull the wire tight while holding it against your bundle with your free hand. The bundle should be wrapped so there are no gaps in its twinnings, and should be equal length on both sides of your middle mark.Grasping your wire close to its end with your pliers can make shaping it easier. After you finish your bundling, your middle mark should not be visible. This bundle will eventually make up the bottom of your wrap. The width of the finished binding should be approximately ¼" (6 mm) for a 12-carat stone, like the one used in this example., Then make another mark a ¼" (6 mm) outward from each of your previous marks.   These double marks on either side of your middle binding define the width of your next bindings.  Now that you've got your middle binding in place and your lines drawn on each piece your six-wire bundle, you can remove your tape, as it is no longer needed to keep your bundle collected together.  Then, use your penknife to pry the topmost wire into the shape of an outward-pointing V. This V-shape should point away from the outer wires of your frame. Repeat this process until you have four Vs, one on each side of the top and bottom of your center binding.   Four V shaped twists on all sides of your center binding will create the sturdiest seating for your centerpiece. However, in this example, the polished stone bead is small and light, only requiring two V bends. Each outer wire should have two V's on either side of the middle binding. Each V begins at the edge of the binding, pointing out from the main bundle until the tip is in line with the first ¼" (6 mm) mark. Then bend the wire to meet the second ¼" (6 mm) mark. After making your V bend seating, allow the remaining wire run parallel to the main bundle., This will ensure that your V bends stay on the outside of your bundle, which will create the most stable seating for your centerpiece. It will also keep your wire frame bundle together while doing the next bindings.  Do this for both sides of your six-wire bundle.   While wrapping your second and third bindings, be sure you keep the wraps tight, neat, and equal in length. A few turns on either side should be sufficient.  Let both side of your six-wire bundle cross at the center-top of the stone.  Bend one of the outermost strands of your six-wire bundle from either side with flat-nose pliers. Shape the wire so that it sticks upward and away from the rest of the wires., Where both sides of your wire frame meet at the top of your design, align all strands so each faces the opposite direction of your first middle binding. The middle binding will form the bottom of your design, and the combined ends of your six-wire bundle will form the top.  This will prevent your wires from becoming bent out of the intended shape of your design when making your final binding. Tape toward the end of your combined six-wire bundle.  A few wraps of 22-gauge square hard wire at the top should do.   Once you have finishing this binding, you may remove the tape.  Use pliers to bend the front and back Vs so as to form a secure seating in which the centerpiece sits. Once the centerpiece is in its cradle, take the final wire that has been pointing away from the bundle and wrap it around your centerpiece in a spiral design to further secure it.   The spiral design of your wire wrap will give a professional appearance to your jewelry. If you notice your centerpiece is loose in its V and front settings, you may want to take another piece from your bundle and add another spiral wrap to the back for support. Consider adding wavy designs, or spirals at the top of your wire wrap where you have extra wire to add your personal touch.  Keep in mind while trimming excess wire that you'll need enough leftover at the top to make a loop of wire. You'll need this loop to thread a neck chain or some other kind of fastener, like a thin strip of leather., This O-shape will form the eyelet through which you will thread your neck fastener. Depending on the gauge of wire you have used, you may want to from your fastener eyelet with either one wire or two.	Choose your centerpiece. Decide which wire best suits your centerpiece. Gather your wire wrapping supplies. Prepare your work space. Cut your frame wires an equal length.Take your 20-gauge square soft wire and clip six pieces eight inches (20 cm) long free. Collect your newly cut wires together. Draw a line to mark the middle of your bundled wire.Lay out your bundled wire flat on your work space and, with your ruler, find the center of the bundle. Cut your first piece of binding wire.This wire will be used to decoratively wrap around the middle mark you have just made on your bundle. Bind your six-wire bundle at its middle mark. Mark the next binding sites for your six-wire frame bundle.Use your ruler and felt tip marker to draw a line a ¼" (6 mm) from each edge of your center binding. Remove the tape from the ends of the wire bundle. Bend the cradle for your centerpiece.Slip your penknife between the bottom of your topmost wire and the wire immediately below it. Re-tape the ends of the bundle. Bind your six-wire bundle with more 22-gauge half-round wire.Wrap the wire around your wire frame bundle with your pliers, starting at the outer part of your V's where the V returns to join the rest of the bundle. Complete the seating for your centerpiece and its wire frame.Take your pliers and, carefully but firmly, bend your six-wire bundle around your centerpiece so that it wraps along the centerpiece's edges. Prepare your front seating for your centerpiece. Combine both ends of your wire frame together. Tape the strands together. Make your final binding at the top of your design.Choose either the topmost or bottom-most wire of your combined bundle and wrap all wires together in a binding that tightly twines the top of your design together. Seat your centerpiece in your wire wrap design. Cut off excess wire. Bend one or two wires at the top of your design to make a loop.
It is worth spending some time considering placement, taking into account furnishings in the room, and the general environment and lighting. A good height for hanging pictures is often when your eye level is about a quarter of the way down the image, although this is a matter of taste.          If you have a friend or family member around, ask them to hold the painting against the wall for you so that you can see it from further away. If you don't have anyone around to hold the painting for you, hold the painting against the all and mark where the corners of the painting are with pencil. You can then put the painting down and step back to look at the markings. Make any adjustments you see fit and repeat until you find where you would like the painting to be. Erase the pencil markings when you are done hanging your picture.; , If you have trouble detecting where the center is by just looking at it, use a tape measure and make sure you make your mark halfway across the top of the picture. You do not need to draw a line along the entire top of the picture; simply mark along the very center of the picture.  Hook a tape measure on the hanging wire attached to the back of the picture. Pull the wire up towards the top of the picture so that it is taut. Measure the distance from the top of the picture to the hanging wire.         If your picture has a crossbar instead of a hanging wire, measure the distance from the crossbar to the top of the picture.  Measure the same distance down from the pencil mark you have made on the wall and mark this point with another pencil mark. This will be where you place your nail. When you make this measurement, try to keep the line as vertical as possible.	Hold the picture you have selected against the wall. Mark the wall along the top center of the picture with a pencil. Put the picture face down on a flat surface. Use this measurement (the distance from the hanging device to the top of the picture) to determine where you should place your nail or screw.
The wiring kit you get should include: large amounts of positive and ground wiring, battery terminal adapters, blue remote turn-on wire, RCA interconnect cable, speaker wire, fuse holder with fuses, connectors & wire ties.; ,, You need to run it from the battery to the amplifier. Since the wires are thick and there is no tool big enough to strip them, the best way is to use a straight edge razor blade. Make cuts on 4 sides down the wire then carefully connect the 4 slits with a slit in the middle all the way around the wire. Then the insulation will come off easily.   Make sure you install a fuse in the positive wire to prevent damage to the amp, your car, yourself and others, in case of an electrical fault.       After the fuse has been fitted, run the wire though the car to your amp. Since wires go to your trunk anyway (if that's where your amp is) find them with a repair manual and follow those with your new wires.  Sometimes any bare metal works. but to be sure it's a good ground. Connect your positive and with a multimeter switch it to 12v dc and touch one end to the end of your positive and the other to your ground. If it reads 12v then it's ok. If it reads OL or 0, you'll need to find somewhere else for the ground.  The RCA is the wire with two connectors on either end and they plug in to your head unit. They usually go to wires sticking out of the unit labeled sub out or output. the White is always negative. Run the RCA in the same place your negative is going to your amp  , This tells your amp to turn on. You will need to pull the radio and connect it to the wire label System Remote. You can find it in a wiring diagram for your radio or sometimes its blue with a white stripe or solid blue.  If the power light come on on the amp then you did good. If your going to do this right you should secure the amp with screws. you can do this with a mounting bracket but this take time and fabrication and is not really necessary. , If it doesn't work, check your fuse on the positive wire. You did put a fuse in didn't you? If it blew you screwed up the wiring. go back and check it out!	Go to the audio shop and buy some wiring adequate for the amperage of your audio amplifier. Disconnect the negative battery terminal before any wiring modifications to your vehicle.  , Install the positive wire. Install the negative. Put in your RCA and REM. Hook up the solid blue REM wire. Hook up your amp with the provided instructions (Make sure your negative battery terminal is disconnected) and tell your radio to turn on the subs or just turn on the radio. Hook up the sub wires to the subs and amplifier with the car off.  , Pray a lot, turn on the car and get ready to bump!
No Irish dancer is ever caught slouching. Your head should be held high and proud.; , You'll be in a position similar to ballet's closed 4th. Then, point your right toe outward. This closed position is what you should return to at all times. This open position should be taken when you point to begin the step.  They should be just a pinch further back than normal because of the position of your shoulders. Put your hands into fists, but be careful not to clench them -- you don't want to tense up.	Stand with your shoulders back and down. Cross your feet. Put your hands to your sides.
Because aluminum is soft, choose a non-abrasive dish detergent such as Dawn. Spread a squirt of the detergent over the aluminum, enough to use to scrub out stains. During regular use, hammered aluminum can be cleaned like any metal dishware.Alternatives to dish detergent include an orange cleaner, lemon juice, or a degreaser such as Dawn Power Dissolver.; , Warm water will loosen up stains such as those from food left on dishware. You don’t need the water to be hot. Submerge the aluminum item in the water.  Again, the brush must be soft or else it will leave scratches. Choose a sponge, non-abrasive pad, a soft-bristled scrub brush, or old toothbrush. Scrub the surface of the aluminum and most stains will come off.Don’t use steel wool or else the aluminum will gain small scratches.  If the stains are still present or when using an alternative detergent such as orange cleaner, allow the aluminum item to sit in warm water. Leave it alone for about five minutes. The warm water should make it easier to scrub or wipe away the stains.Five minutes is often enough to clear off debris while minimizing water exposure, but for stubborn stains you can try soaking it for 30 minutes.  Place the aluminum item under warm, running water. Make sure all the cleaner is rinsed off the surface.  Use a soft cloth to remove all the moisture. Make sure all the water is gone so none of it sits on the metal and causes stains.	Use a gentle detergent on the aluminum. Fill the sink with warm water. Scrub the stains with a non-abrasive brush. Soak still-stained pieces for a few minutes. Rinse off the soap. Dry the aluminum off immediately.
If you purchase it, look for a good quality peat-based compost mixture. If you make your own growing bag, add the same contents into a bag that is large enough to grow your plants. In both cases, you will need to make a rectangular slit in the bag to create a rectangle with edges on the top half of the bag. Make sure to leave plenty of edging to contain the peat compost mixture.; ,, Good choices include tomatoes, peppers (capsicum), eggplants, zucchini, cucumbers, marrow, strawberries, French beans, lettuce, herbs and flowers.  Poke a few drainage holes in the side of the bag and keep it well watered. The plastic heats the peat mix up considerably, so keeping a moist soil is essential for the growing plants to succeed.  When space is a premium, and gardening in this way is the only opportunity you have to grow your own vegetables, you can increase the crop by under planting. For example, if you are growing tomatoes which grow tall, add some lettuces or radishes underneath the tomatoes. Just be sure to wait until the tomatoes are well grown before planting the under-plants.  Over time the plans will deplete the nutrients already in the mix and you will need to add more. A compost tea addition is ideal.  You may need to add stakes or similar objects to prop up taller plants as they grow. Be careful not to pierce these through the bottom.	Obtain or make your growing bag. Position the bag where you will grow your plants.  , Plant shallow-rooted plants in the bag. Keep the bag well watered. Make the most of the space. Add more nutrients as the season moves on. Prop up tall plants as needed.
Sometimes your plan does not work out the way you planned it. In that case it is wise to have a backup plan. Taking a taxi or an Uber is a good way to avoid drinking if you have had too much to drink and don’t have a safe way home.Call a cab when your designated driver has also had too much to drink or has left the party. Call a cab when you are alone and have not designated a driver to get you home.  If a taxi is too expensive consider taking the bus or train to get home safely. Use caution if you are using public transportation while you are intoxicated. Try to be aware of your surroundings and travel with at least one other person., In some larger cities, there are designated driver services that can get both you and your car home. Some non-profit organizations and for-profit companies will offer designated driver services during peak drinking times, such as New Year’s Eve.Remember to tip your driver as many of them are volunteers. Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have designated driver services available in each county. Dryver is a designated driver service that provides a website and app to help you find a designated driver.  Make an agreement with a friend or family member that you can trust to pick you up when you need them to. Make sure that this person is reliable and responsible and won’t pick you up when they are intoxicated themselves.	Call a taxi. Use public transportation. Make use of designated driver programs. Have a designated friend or family member on speed dial.
Hold the lip in place around your water source, to ensure that it doesn’t slip off as the balloon begins to take on water weight. If you have any trouble with slippage, use your other hand to support the expanding balloon from below.   The "lip" of the balloon is that thick ring of material which surrounds the balloon's opening, through which water and air can flow. You should make sure the area around you can handle an accidental water balloon explosion, as even seasoned pros will have their fair share of these. Make sure there are no electronics or non-waterproof valuables nearby.  Ensure you’ve firmly secured the balloon before turning on that faucet, hose, or spout. Experience will help you determine the speed at which to fill the balloon but opt for a slower pace at first, increasing water flow only as you gain practice with the procedure.          Water balloons are typically smaller than balloons designed to be filled with air or gas mixtures, so keep this is mind if you’re used to dealing with air-based balloons. If you overfill the balloon, it will let you know by politely exploding on you. If your balloon does indeed burst, take note of the point at which this happens to ensure you don’t fill your next balloon to that point.  The lip should be pointing up, and the weight of the full balloon should stretch its neck. If the sagging balloon doesn't appear to have enough neck—you'll likely require 2-6 inches—you've likely overfilled your balloon.          The "neck" of the balloon is that slightly elongated section of the balloon where the main body of the balloon meets the lip.  The lip should come all the way around and underneath your pinching fingers. Exclude your middle finger from this loop.  Grasp the lip with that finger and thumb.           You should be pulling your thumb and index finger inward, toward the hand that they belong to.	Stretch the opening of the balloon's lip around the faucet. Fill the balloon with water. Remove the water balloon from the faucet, with its neck between the index and middle fingers of one hand. Grab the lip with your free hand and loop the balloon’s neck over the top of your pinching hand's thumb and index finger. Pass the lip from your looping hand to your wrapped-up finger and thumb. Retract the lip, along with your finger and thumb, backward through the loop that's wrapped up around them. Allow the loop to slide forward, off your fingers, and the water's weight should tighten the knot for you.
You'll need fake leather or very thin real leather, a box cutter, strong glue, a button, tread and a strong needle, and scissors.  You'll need a pattern for a large equilateral triangle. Search "equilateral triangle" on Google Images in order to get an image you can print out to use as a template.  Place the pattern on the wrong side of your leather, trace it, and cut it out very carefully with the box cutter.  Fold the top point down to the center of the bottom edge and then fold one of the sides over to cover it. The unfolded side will become the opening flap.  Mark the point that is create opposite of the flap. Sew the button onto the nice side of the leather, centered about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) from what would be the very tip of that point.  Glue the two folded over pieces together to create the pouch. The button piece should end up on top so that the tip of the flap can be folded down to meet it.  Cut a slit in the flap tip to create a button hole.  You can add designs with gold paint or glue trim around the opening to hide the uneven edges if you want to.  You can now use your coin purse!	Get your materials. Make a pattern. Use your pattern to cut out your leather. Fold the leather. Sew on the button. Create the pouch. Cut the hole for the button. Add finishing touches. Finished.
Audacity is a free audio editor that works on both Windows and macOS. Click the green “Download” button to get the latest version for your operating system, and then save it to your computer.; , When the download is complete, double-click the installer and follow the prompts to Install Audacity.   Read the help files and familiarize yourself with the program, as the individual instructions are beyond the scope of this article. For more about Audacity, see Use Audacity.  Audacity requires a plugin called LAME to save MP3 files. You’ll need this when it comes time to save your karaoke creation.Navigate to http://lame.buanzo.org in a web browser. Click to download the latest version of LAME for your operating system (the first option listed under your operating system). When prompted, save the file to a location you’ll remember.  The process is slightly different depending on your operating system.Windows: Double-click the installer file and follow the prompts to install LAME. Make sure not to change any of the default settings, as they are all required to make the plugin work. Mac: Double-click the installer (it ends with .dmg) to mount it, then double-click the mounted “Lame Library v.3.98.2 for Audacity.pkg” file (the version number may be different). Follow the prompts to complete the installation.  Now you’ll use Audacity’s Vocal Reduction filter to reduce vocals in the song. If you’re not sure that your MP3 is stereo, try listening to it with headphones. If it’s stereo, you may hear different sounds and volumes in the right and left ear pieces.   Importing the song into Audacity is the only surefire way to know whether or not the song is in stereo. It's also best to get the highest possible quality you can find—look for 320 kbps files, if possible. See How to Download Free Music for tips on finding audio files.  Open Audacity, and then:   Click to expand the File menu at the top of the screen. Navigate to “Import” > “Audio…” Locate and double-click your MP3 track to open it.  If this MP3 is in stereo, the track will show 2 channels. This means you’ll see 2 long visuals of the song (2 long waveforms) stacked on top of one another. You’ll also see the word “Stereo” in the sidebar just beneath the track name., Before making any final changes, you’ll want to select about 5-10 seconds of the song that has lead vocals so you can preview your changes. Here’s how:   Click the mouse in the time bar just above the track to play it from that spot. Find a place in the song where vocals occur for about 5-10 seconds. Hover the mouse over the tracks until your cursor appears. Click and drag to highlight the part of the song to preview.  Now that you have a selection defined to preview, you can test removing the vocals.  This effect helps remove vocals that are at the center of the track with other instruments spread around them. Most modern music is mixed this way, though there are exceptions., These settings define how the effect will run on the main vocals.   Leave “Action” set to “Vocal Reduction. This ensures that you’re reducing the vocals instead of reducing the music. “Strength” should be “1,” which just means “apply this affect at it’s normal strength.” You may need to increase this to “2” later if the vocals are particularly loud.  This value will determine the lowest frequency (Hz) to be removed from the track. You may have to come back and adjust these values later, depending on the result.   If the vocals you want to remove are very low and have a lot of bass (e.g. Barry White, Leonard Cohen), type “100” into the box.For vocals that are low but less bassy (e.g. Drake, Toni Braxton), start at “100.” For most mid-range vocals (e.g. Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen) set this value to “120.” For vocals that are very high (e.g., children’s voices, Mariah Carey), set this value to “150.” If you still hear the vocals perfectly after you make the change, you can come back and set this to “200.”  , This is the top frequency of the vocals. Going too high may cut out higher-pitched instruments in the song, but not going high enough may not capture all the vocals. You can always undo your changes and return to this screen to make adjustments.   For almost all vocals, setting this value to “7000” should work fine., Note that backup vocals can usually not be removed with this method, as they are often on a different track.   Note that if there's reverb on the vocals or other types of processing, the lead vocals will not disappear completely—you may hear a "ghost" vocal in the background. When you're singing over that, it will seem like it's your voice being reverberated!  , If the preview doesn’t sound the way you hoped:   If you find that a lot of the bass in the song is missing, try increasing the Low Cut value by 20 Hz until you find a good balance between bass and vocal-removal. If deeper parts of the vocals are coming through, try reducing the Low Cut by 20 until a good balance is found. Try setting Strength to “2” if adjusting the Low Cut doesn’t work. If you’ve changed the parameters and hear no change to the vocals, this song is not mixed in a way that is compatible with this feature.  When you’ve found parameters that sound good in the preview, click “OK” to filter the entire song. This may take a few minutes, depending on your computer and the length of the song.  Listen to the main vocals—While you may not be able to remove every last trace of the vocals, you should be able to cut much of their sound using this filter as long as vocals are mixed in the center of the track.   To undo your changes, click “Edit > “Undo Vocal Reduction and Isolation.”  , Now that you’ve finished creating your instrumental track, it’s time to save it as an MP3 file.,, This is a matter of preference. A higher bit rate MP3 will take up more hard drive space but sound much better. A low bit rate means a smaller file, but it won’t sound as good. Note that since you’re editing a compressed file, you will lose a bit of quality in this process.   For a small file that still sounds amazing, set Bit Rate Mode to “Variable” and select “Best Quality.” This option should work great for almost anyone. If you’re not worried about file size and need the highest possible quality, set the Bit Rate Mode to “Preset” and Quality to 320kbps. This will give you the best quality file Audacity can make. If your goal is the tiniest file possible, set the Bit Rate Mode to “Variable” and choose anything lower than “3” (155-195 kbps).  Browse to the folder where you’d like to save the file.  Once the file is saved, you’ll be able to play it any application that supports MP3 files.	Download Audacity from https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity. Install Audacity. Download LAME for Audacity. Install LAME for Audacity. Get a stereo MP3 of the song. Import the MP3 to a new project in Audacity. Verify that the track is a stereo track. Select a part of the song with vocals to test. Open the “Effects” menu. Select “Vocal Reduction and Isolation” from the menu. Set your vocal reduction parameters. Set the “Low Cut for Vocals” cutoff. Set the “High Cut for Vocals” cutoff. Click “Preview” to test the current values. Change the settings if you run into issues. Click “OK” to apply the filter to the entire track. Listen to the track. Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+E (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+E (Mac) to export your file. Change the “Save As Type” to “MP3.” Now you’ll see a few options for changing MP3-specific details.  , Set the MP3 quality. Choose a location to save your file. Click “Save.” Audacity will now create your MP3 file and save it to the location you specified.
Copper tubing used for plumbing piping is available sized nominally, meaning that the outside diameter of the tubing is 1/8" (0.125 inches) larger than its stated size. In other words, 1" nominal copper tubing measures 1.125" inches in diameter.   If you need to cut the pipe for your project, make sure that you use a tube cutter, clamping the pipe firmly and rotating the cutter around the pipe. It should take about 8 turns.; , Typically, though, residential projects will involve copper tubing of either Type L or M.   Type L tubing is marked with a blue tag and is typically the most commonly used in commercial/residential installations. Type M is marked red and has the lightest wall that can be used for a pressurized system.  Reducing adapters, which are used to go from a larger size pipe to a smaller size. Elbow joints, which are used to turn corners, typically 90 degree bends, but also available in 45 degree bends. Tees and crosses, which are used to join a branch tubing to the main tubing, using a tee, or two branches in the case of a "cross."  , For potable water systems, lead-free solid core solder must be used. It is typically 95/5 (95% tin and 5% antimony), or an alloy of tin and a small amount of copper and/or silver, commonly sold in one pound rolls of 1/8" diameter wire. Solder with lead must not be used for potable water systems.  This is typically a jelly with a zinc chloride or rosin cleaning component used to cover the cleaned surfaces of the copper to be soldered before assembly and heating. It is the function of the flux, upon heating, to facilitate further cleaning, exclude atmospheric oxygen, prevent re-oxidation, and to aide in wetting out the solder.  Typically, a traditional electric soldering iron won't be hot enough to work with copper tubing. You'll need a heat source of sufficient output capacity to heat the assembled fittings and tubing to a temperature above that required to melt the filler solder, typically 400 to 500 °F (204 to 260 °C). For this reason, a propane/air, or acetylene/air torch fitted with a tip of appropriate size is most often used. Clean, dry cotton rags and a spray bottle full of water will complete the necessary soldering materials.  Remove the copper oxide coating on both the outside of the tubing in the area to be inserted into the fitting, and the inside of the fitting itself. For this, you can use sandpaper, emery cloth, or specialty devices sold in stores for this purpose. All copper oxide must be thoroughly removed from both surfaces until they are both completely clean, with no dirt, grease, oil or other impediment which will interfere with the wetting out of the solder. If you don't, this will result in a leaky joint somewhere down the road.   Any small drips of water through the joint being soldered will prevent the process from working, resulting in a leaky fitting. If the system valves will not stop the drip completely before you start working, stop up the pipe with a piece of white bread, inserted in the tubing as far as possible away from the heated area. This will temporarily dam the water flow and will dissolve easily during the flushing operation suggested at the end of the job.  Apply flux to the inside and outside of the copper tubing.  Move the end of the blue flame against the assembled fitting and tubing, moving it all around the components in the area into which solder must be placed. With constant movement at all times, heat slowly and uniformly while testing the melting point of the solder by touching the tip of the solder wire to the joint.   This will take some practice. Try holding the flame in your non-dominant hand and the solder in your writing hand. Remember, you're using the flame essentially to heat up the solder and melt it. You accomplish this by applying the flame to the copper tubing and then touching the solder to the joint. The heated tubing will draw the melted solder into the joint by capillary action. Use the flame sparingly.  Move the solder and flame to the side opposite the melted solder, continually feeding small amounts of solder and moving the torch until the solder has circled the fitting.   The solder will seem to run toward the heat. The purpose is to allow the solder to completely fill the area between the fitting and the tubing by letting it run into the cracks. On larger fittings, concentrate the heat slightly ahead of the wetted solder to allow this to occur. Be careful not to overheat the copper. Keep the torch moving constantly to prevent blackening the copper. If the joint is overheated and blackened, you'll need to disassemble it and re-clean the pipe, otherwise you'll risk a leaky fitting.  Spray a mist of water on the area soldered to freeze the solder and prevent movement of the joint which would create a leak.  Use fresh potable water to remove any excess flux, dirt, or loose solder beads inside the tubing after all soldered connections are completed. This will also help you check for leaks when the job is done.	Get copper tubing of appropriate diameter. Make sure the tubing is of the proper wall thickness for your project.Most nominally-sized copper tubing is available in four weights, or wall thicknesses, which is color-coded. Get the proper connectors and joints for the system you are building.Depending on your project, you'll probably need some combination of the following:   Male/Female adapters, which are used to join a solder pipe to a threaded pipe. Select solder. Obtain the appropriate solder flux. Get a heat source. Prepare the pipe. Brush the cleaned surfaces with the solder flux as soon as possible after cleaning, and assemble the fitting and tubing. Light the torch and adjust it so you have a blue flame. Melt solder into the joint. Wipe excess liquid solder from the hot surfaces using a clean, dry cotton rag. Flush the piping thoroughly.
One of the easiest ways is with your hands, although it’s not always the most ideal, especially if you are working with a very large piece of mirror. If the mirror is small enough for you to hold, firmly grasp it in both hands and place one thumb on each side of the first score line. Press down with both thumbs simultaneously, taking care to do so with equal pressure.Quickly make a snapping motion with your wrists and the mirror should break crisply along the score line. Always wear protective gloves when you’re breaking glass. The score lines render the glass unstable and sometimes it can shatter in ways you aren’t expecting.  Use your hands to press down on the unscored side, applying pressure along the score line. The glass should cleanly snap. You can also place the mirror on the edge of a flat surface, making sure to line up the score line with the edge. Use your hand to press down on the side of the glass that is hanging over the edge until you see the glass snap crisply., If you feel uncomfortable breaking the mirror with your hands, or if the piece of glass is too large to do it that way, use running pliers. Place them so the bottom jaw touches the score on your mirror. The top jaw should touch the mirror about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the score line. Squeeze the pliers, which will cause them to separate, and the pressure will widen the score line. This widening will cause the score to crack along the rest of your line in a very controlled breaking pattern.If you’re breaking a long score line, you might want to apply the pliers gently at one end, until you hear a very faint clicking sound. Then turn the mirror around and do the same thing on the other end of the line. This will cleanly complete the break at the edges.  For scores that have multiple curves, turn the mirror upside down on a springy surface, such as a piece of foam or cardboard. If the curve isn't very dramatic, press down on the score line with your thumb, which will cause the break. However, running pliers are the best to use on curves and semi-circles. If you're cutting mirror with lots of curves, invest in running pliers and the breaking process will go much more smoothly.  If you’re placing your mirror in a frame so that the raw edges won’t be visible, this is probably unnecessary (although you can still do it if you like). Sand down the edges with sandpaper, then apply mirror edge sealant or some other hermetic coating to the edges. You can find these materials at any hardware store. You can also use clear fingernail polish and get similar results.	Use your hands to break a small mirror down the scored line.There are a number of ways to cleanly break the mirror. Snap larger score lines by applying pressure on a flat surface.Place the mirror, scored-side down, on a soft and flat surface. Break the glass along the score line with running pliers. Use running pliers and a springy surface to break curved score lines. Sand and seal the edges of your newly cut mirror (optional).
Hot peppers have a compound in them called capsaicin. Mammals are sensitive to capsaicin, and the compound registers on their taste buds as "hot" and serves as an irritant. This spray is considered to be effective for such garden animal pests as deer, rabbits, voles, squirrels, possums and insects.; ,,, Then turn off the heat and let it cool to room temperature. , Label it so that anyone coming across it knows what the contents are; it's also a good idea to add the date to it.   For added sticking power, you might like to add a few drops of pure dish soap to the liquid as well.  Always wear gloves and eye protection before using this spray––it can burn your skin and eyes if it touches them and it's painful. Be sure to spray the entire plant, for full protection.   Shake before using. Use the spray early morning or in the evening––if sprayed in the heat of the day, it may burn the plants.If you're not sure how sensitive plants will cope, test a small area first. Wait four days and if the plant doesn't react, then using the spray on it should be okay.Do not spray this on windy days. The back spray may hit you or go anywhere but on the plants you're trying to protect. As mentioned earlier, do not spray anywhere near waterways, lakes or ponds.  It will also need to be reapplied after rain.	Understand how the spray works. Take one quart (950ml) of water and put it in a pot.  , Take one-half cup of dried hot peppers (available at most Asian groceries), and put them in the pot.  , Bring the pot of water and peppers to just barely boiling. Strain out the peppers and throw them away.  , Put the liquid into a spray bottle. Spray it on the plants you want to protect. Re-spray every week for maximum benefit.
There are many different kinds of clay, any of which can create a dog. Deciding which clay to use depends on your desired end result.          Select your colors. You may choose to purchase different colors of clay to create the dog, or you can select to use one solid color and paint the dog after it is finished. Some clays, like polymer, can be baked into a finished piece very quickly in an oven. If you don't have an oven to use for your clay, you may prefer to select an air-dry clay, however, you will have to wait four or five days to finish it. If you are doing clay animation, you will want to select an oil-based clay that will not dry out.; , Instead of trying to mold a dog shape from a large chunk of clay, break apart the clay into several smaller pieces.          Keep one larger piece to create the torso of the dog. Break off a piece for the head. Make four pieces of equal size to create the legs. Roll the pieces into balls to try and keep the size as even as possible for each leg. Make one smaller piece for the tail. Set the remainder aside to use for other small shapes that remain, such as the ears and eyes.  Form a cylindrical shape with the largest piece of clay. Roll some clay into a ball and shape it into a rectangle. Round the edges a little to make the rectangular body look like a dog body.          You may want to adjust the torso to be smaller or larger depending on the kind of dog you want to create. For example, a basset hound or dachshund will have a much longer body, but much shorter limbs. If you are making a large sculpture, you may want to crumple up damp newspaper and mold the clay around it. This will save you clay, make the sculpture lighter and save you time when baking., You can shape a single piece by forming a pointed snout at the front and rounding the back. Or, you can shape a separate ball of clay for the snout and press it to the front of the face. Stick it on the top of the end of the body.          To keep the head in place you might want to insert a toothpick halfway into the body of the dog. Then, place the head on the top half of the toothpick.  Flatten the bottoms and add pads with brown or black clay. Put two legs on the back of the dog, and two legs on the front.          Use the legs to help create the pose for your dog. You might want to make him stand, sit, or lie down. It is entirely up to you.  Roll another piece of clay between your hands to create the tail. You might want to make it long and pointy, or short and stubby. It depends entirely on the kind of dog you want to create. Attach the tail to the rear of the dog.  You will want to have ears, a snout, mouth, eyes, and a nose. You can use smaller pieces of clay to shape the pieces, or use your modeling tools to carve some of them into the existing form. The more time you take creating details, the more lifelike your dog will be.          Consider adding a tongue. Add a small piece of thin clay out the side of your dog's mouth. Try pressing two small lines into each paw to create some toes. If you are using different colors of clay you can give your dogs some spots by adding small, thin patches of different colors over the body or legs. Create a collar by forming a long flat strip and wrapping it around the neck of the dog.  Check the instructions for your polymer clay to find the right temperature and time for the type of clay and the size of your clay dog.          Polymer clays will all cook at a temperature between 215°F (102°C) to 325°F (163°C)., Wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature. Place the tile with the dog on it on the middle rack of your oven.  Follow the cooking times suggested by the manufacturer for your type of clay. The larger your clay dog is, the longer it will take you to cook it in the oven.  Certain ovens use rapid heating systems that can create dips and spikes in the temperature. You should try to monitor the temperature in the oven to make sure your clay isn't getting too hot or not hot enough. Too cold and your clay may become brittle, too hot and you may end up burning the clay.  When the timer goes off take out your clay dog. Leave the dog to cool on the ceramic tile. Don't worry if the clay doesn't appear firm when you first remove it from the oven. As the clay cools down it will harden.          Use oven mitts when handling the tile. It will be hot.  You don't need to wash or sand your clay beforehand. Just brush on your base coat. Then add as much or little detail as you like.          Select the colors that suit your type of dog. You might use mainly brown and black for a rottweiler, or white and black for a dalmatian. Avoid spray-on paints as they contain a solvent that can degrade your clay.  It may take 15-20 minutes to dry from the time you finish painting.  Use a different brush to apply the varnish. This will give your clay dog a nice glossy finish. The coat of varnish will seal in the paint and help protect it from chipping.	Select your clay. Break down the clay into manageable pieces. Make the body. Shape the head. Roll out four identical cylinder shapes for the legs. Make a tail. Add some details. Heat the oven. Place the clay dog on a glass or ceramic tile. Set a timer so you know when the time is up. Use an oven thermometer. Remove the dog from the oven. Use acrylic paints. Let the paint dry. Brush on a coat of clear varnish.
Make a figure of 8 with your first rubber band and poke your index finger through one hole and your middle finger through the other.  This time, don't twist them to make a figure 8. Instead, simply slide them over your fingers in an 0 shape.  Take one side of the bottom band and bring it up and over your finger, and then drop it so that it rests on top of the other two rubber bands, in between your fingers. Do the same with the other side.  Place it on top of the last one, spread between your fingers. Make sure you do this after each step, so that there are always three rubber bands on your fingers.  Pull one end up over your finger and drop it over the rubber bands in the middle, and repeat with the other side. Then add another rubber band to your fingers.  You will quickly see a fishtail pattern forming between your fingers; this will be your bracelet. Keep weaving the rubber bands until the bracelet is big enough to fit around your wrist.  Take the two bottom bands and pull them over so that you only have one around your fingers. Then slip the loose ends onto a C or S clip, and do the same with the loose end on the bottom of the bracelet.	Use two fingers as a loom, and set up your first band. Place another two rubber bands on top. Bring the bottom rubber band over the top of the other two. Add another rubber band. Again, bring the bottom band over the others. Keep repeating this pattern. Finish your bracelet. Experiment with different color and weaving patterns to create lots of different rubber band bracelets.
Before starting a book get a notebook, preferably one made of recycled paper, a pen and a nice cup of tea or coffee. Find a comfortable place to sit.; , This is a tip in general for whenever you read- always know why you are reading a book. What do you wish to achieve by reading the book? Is it for a research essay? Or for a presentation? Or is it just so you learn something new?  , This is the easiest step of all. Just open the book and start reading.  Ask yourself questions like "What does this information mean?", "Do I have to look up something else to understand this information better?" etc., This works for both fiction and non-fiction., You could also write down any words that you are unfamiliar with. Write down the meaning and the sentence you read it in on a separate page which could be maintained as the glossary for your commonplace book. This could help with building your vocabulary.  Use post-its for keywords or write the information on another sheet and clip it in the right section.	Gather essentials. Consider why you are reading. Read. Analyze the information you read. Refer to other books or the Internet for background information to put the book into historical context. Write down quotes that strike you, key words for quick reference and your thoughts about what you are reading. Go through the notes every now and then and add to it.
Pull the lyrics up online to make sure you're not mishearing any of them. For now, just focus on your first impressions. What do you think the song is about? What parts confuse you, and what parts seem perfectly clear? There are no wrong answers, as your first impressions help decide the feel and theme of the song.   What is the overall mood of the song? How do the lyrics match up with the instruments? Do they have a similar feel or are they conflicting with each other?; , Great lyrics are a form of poetry, and reading them without the distraction of instruments can help you parse out their intent. When reading the question, ask yourself the same questions you might ask about a poem:   Who is the speaker? Don't just assume that the speaker is literally the singer -- they could be playing a character or referencing a larger issue. If there is a "you" or a "we" in the song, who does this refer to? A lover? A friend? A politician? What are the major images or ideas that keep popping up.  Good lyrics have a "visual" component as well. They describe a scene or feeling with images, not just vague ideas or phrases. If you were making a movie of the song, what are the images that keep cropping up? By visualizing the song as a scene, do any of the most confusing lines start to make sense?   Where does the song take place? This could be a very specific location, like Kent State in Neil Young's "Ohio," or something vaguer, like a girl's bedroom in Tailor Swift's "Love Story." "New Slang" by The Shins starts with the line "Gold teeth and a curse for this town were all in my mouth // only I don't know how they got out, dear." This may seem confusing, but later lyrics show that he was being rude at a bar. He got punched in the face for saying his "curse."  , Metaphors and figurative language are when the words don't literally mean what they say. When Bob Dylan suggests that "the answers, my friend, are blowing in the wind," he doesn't actually mean the answers are flying in a breeze. He means that the answers are simple and all around us if we just take the time to stop and look. When faced with unusual sections, ask yourself if they may stand for something other than what they appear.   Look for comparisons and commonality. Most metaphors aren't perfect, they simply draw a simple line between two things. "My love is a rose" doesn't necessarily mean a woman is red, slender, etc. It likely means she is beautiful but also dangerously thorny. Search online for images or ideas you don't understand. They may come from movies, other songs, old myths, etc.  Sites like Genius.com allow anyone to annotate lyrics with interpretations, explanations, and definitions of each line. Even better, the actual lyricists often write their own notes on the site, which are labeled and verified to help you understand more oblique lyrics.   Try out SongMeanings, SongFacts, and LyricInterpretations, as well. Note, however, that you don't have to agree with every annotation put up by other people. These sites are great places to start breaking down complex sections, however., The Eagle's "Hotel California" is one of the most debated songs of all time, because so many people have so many interpretations of it. Some think it references the music industry, which traps you with promises of wealth. Others think the hotel is a gateway to Hell, trapping wayward sinners. A few believe it is just a fictional story of a dangerous place. None of them are totally wrong and none are totally right.   What is most important is that you can defend your position with evidence from the song. As long as you can back up your meaning with actual lyrics or stories, it is a valid meaning. Most artists will even admit that they don't know the song's full meaning. Writing lyrics can be subconsciousness, and the meaning people get from listening to a song is just as important as the meaning when writing it.	Listen to the song while reading the lyrics. Read the lyrics on their own to decipher their meaning. Focus on concrete imagery and senses. Unpack unusual or poetic phrases one at a time. Check a lyric annotation site for additional clues. Remember that there is rarely one "right" meaning.
Take your first strip, and unfold the prongs on the last link. Keep the first link folded. Bring the folded link towards the unfolded one, and place it between the two unfolded prongs. Fold the prongs back inward, sliding them through the slots. Make sure that you slide the front prong through the front slot, and the back prong through the back slot., When you are done, you will have a total of 5 rings. They should look a little like crowns., Take a long needle, preferably one with a blunt tip, such as a plastic yarn needle. Thread some fishing line or thread through it, then tie the end to one of the wrappers/links on your first ring. Make sure that the knot is inside the ring., Try to find an open path, without piercing through the paper., Push the needle through the matching link and out through the top. Keep stacking rings and pushing the needle through the links until you have pushed the needle out through the top of the fifth ring., Find the next opening on the top link, and push the needle down through it. Keep threading the needle back through the links until you reach the bottom.You'll be sewing up through the outside, then down through the inside.  Flatten the bag first, then fold the edges together, so that the pointed links fit into the notched links. There will be a link at each corner of your bag that does not match up. Tuck these links into the bag., Tie the end of your thread to the first link on the right. Push your needle up through the link and out the other end. Next, bring it down through the link on the left, and tug it gently. Do this step twice.Keep the corner piece tucked inside the bag.  Bring the needle back up through the link on the right. Push it up through the second link above it. Pull the thread taut, then push the needle back down through the second link on the left. Keep sewing across the bottom of the bag in a similar fashion until you reach the opposite end.Keep the corner piece tucked inside the bag.  Make sure that you are tying the thread off inside the bag so that it is less visible.	Join the ends of your first strip together to make a ring. Continue joining the other 4 strips in a similar fashion. Thread your needle, the tie the tread to one of the links inside the ring. Push the needle through one of the links and out through the other end. Place your second ring on top, match up the links, and join them together. Bring the needle back down. Flatten the bottom of your bag first, and tuck the corners in. Start sewing the bottom of the bag together. Continue sewing the bottom of your bag. Tie the thread off and cut it.
If you're wanting to grow a loquat tree in cooler area, the white-fleshed fruits are a better bet than the orange-fleshed fruit. The white-fleshed fruits also do better in coastal areas.Loquats can be found in Asian markets and other exotic fruit stores.; , If you're wanting to grow a tree from fruit you already have, you need to start by pulling the seeds out of the fruit. Most loquats have three to five seeds in them. The seeds are fairly large and brown.Some growers caution against growing loquat trees from seeds if you plan on eating the fruit, as you don't know exactly how the fruit will turn out. In fact, it may not produce fruit at all.However, it will make a perfectly fine ornamental plant either way.Purchasing a small sapling is a better idea if you want it to grow fruit.  Make sure all the fruit is off the seeds by removing it with your fingers. Next, run the seeds under cool water, removing any remaining pulp and fruit juice residue., Another option for loquat seeds is to purchase them. Your best bet for finding them is an online retailer. For instance, heirloom seed sites or specialty seed stores will likely carry them., Peat pods work well for growing loquat seeds, which you can buy at your local garden center. Place one seed in each starter.However, the seeds are fairly hardy and will likely germinate in potting soil, as well.  Loquat seeds don't need special treatment to germinate like some seeds do. You won't need to score them or anything like that.Water the seeds after you plan them in their pots. Keep watering them once a day until they begin sprouting. After that, water the pods when they're dry.  When they reach about half a foot, you'll need to transplant the seedlings to a larger pot.You can also transplant them outside if you have mild weather. Loquats can do well in most soils, but you can make the conditions more favorable. Mix in organic material to lightly fertilize the soil. Add in something to improve drainage, such as peat moss., Make sure the roots are somewhat exposed before replanting. You can turn a hose on the roots if you need to.Place dirt in a larger pot, and gently set the new seedling (with the original media) into the the pot. Surround the root system with soil until you reach the base of the plant., Pick a sunny spot for your tree. Dig a hole that's bigger than the root system, though only slightly. Make sure the roots are partially exposed by turning a hose on them. Set the tree in the ground, and pack the dirt around it.If you are planting in a place with mild winters, plant it outside in the fall. If you have colder winters, plant the tree outside in early spring.If you are planting more than one tree, it should be planted 25 to 30 feet away from the next loquat tree. If it's a dwarf tree, you may get away with only 13 feet or so apart.  Inside, water the plant when the soil is dry. Outside, water when you put the tree in the ground. After that, water three times a week for at least three to four months, which will help the tree take root.Give enough water to soak the roots but don't leave standing water.  The tree needs to be free from competition. Therefore, it's best to kill off any vegetation in a 3-foot diameter around the tree. You can use a herbicide to kill off the vegetation. Add mulch after the vegetation dies so you don't have to use herbicide again., Once the tree is well established outside, it will need fertilizer from time to time. When you see new growth, you can apply a general lawn fertilizer (without a weed killer) to the tree.The tree will need 1 cup (240 milliliters) of fertilizer for each year of growth in the first 3 years (1 cup in the first year, 2 cups in the second year, etc.). However, you should spread it out in three to four applications over the year. Once the tree is older, you'll need to use a pound per inch of trunk, spread out over the year.  If your goal is to get fruit from the tree, you're going to have to wait a while. Fruit may arrive as early as 2 to 3 years after planting.However, it can take as long as a decade for the tree to bear any fruit., Loquats are not easy to pull off the tree, even when ripe. To get them off, you'll need to clip off clusters with pruning shears. Otherwise, you may bruise or damage the fruit.When it does bear fruit, wait for the fruit to ripen on the tree. These fruits don't ripen well off the tree. Look for the proper color based on the variety you're growing to determine ripeness.	Choose white-fleshed fruit for cooler climates. Remove the seeds from the fruit. Rinse the seeds off. Buy loquat seeds. Try a soil-less media. Prepare the soil in the transplant location. Transplant them to a larger pot. Plant the tree outside. Water the plant. Mulch around the tree. Fertilize when you see new growth. Expect to wait several years for the tree to bear fruit. Clip the stalk of the fruit.
Look at the area close up and inspect whether you have a scratch or just debris on your car. /images/thumb/3/36/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-1-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/3/36/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-1-Version-2.jpg           Sometimes what appears to be a scratch is actually a raised line of material from an impact. This occurs when your car contacts another bumper or any object whose coating is softer than your car paint. These imperfections require much less work to remove.; , After you have actually determined that you do have some scratches that need repair, you need to figure out how deep the scratch is. This will determine how you approach repairs. Scratches to the clear coat can be easily fixed by following these steps. /images/thumb/e/e8/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/e8/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg           Your car has 4 main layers: clear coat, color, primer and steel. If the scratch is only as deep as the clear coat or color, it will be much easier to remove. If you can see a different color or steel, the scratch is deep and might be more difficult to repair at home.  While you may have one scratch that is bothering you enough to start a repair project, it's a good idea to look for any other areas that could be repaired at the same time. If you already have the tools and materials to do the job, why not do it all the way! /images/thumb/5/5f/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-3-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/5/5f/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-3-Version-2.jpg          , If your car is dirty during scratch repair, that dirt could cause more scratches to be created. /images/thumb/e/ee/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-4-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/ee/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-4-Version-2.jpg           Pay particular attention to the area you will be repairing. Spray the scratched area with water, making sure to get any debris out of the scratch.  Wrap 2000-grit wet/dry sandpaper around a sanding pad and begin sanding.The goal is to sand just through the clear coat and no further. /images/thumb/e/e5/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/e5/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg           Always sand in the direction of the scratch.You do not want to create opposing scratches, which will only create more ridges and valleys in the paint that need to be repaired. Periodically rinse the area with water. This will allow you to better see if you have gotten to the bottom of the scratch. If the scratch is slightly deeper than the clear coat, use 1500-grit sandpaper initially to level the surface and then 2000-grit sandpaper to remove the scratches made by the coarser sandpaper. Avoid getting dirt or debris between the sandpaper and the vehicle. This will cause scratching.  Use good quality and clean microfiber cloths to wipe dry the surface. Remember that using old rags could simply cause more scratches on the surface of your car! /images/thumb/d/df/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-6-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/d/df/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-6-Version-2.jpg          , Do not turn on the buffer quite yet, but use a buffer pad to spread the compound around the area that is dull from sanding. /images/thumb/b/b6/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-7-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/b/b6/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-7-Version-2.jpg           Rubbing compound is an abrasive that takes off a bit more of the paint surface but it also smoothes out the paint surface, getting it ready to be waxed. Basically the rubbing compound is used to take out the scratches from the sandpaper., Turn the buffer on its lowest level and move it around for approximately 10 seconds. You need to polish the rubbing compound relatively quickly, so that it does not dry before being smoothed out./images/thumb/b/bd/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/b/bd/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg           Increase the speed to 2000 RPM and buff for one minute. You should be moving the buffer from side to side and then moving downward slowly. Continue until the dullness has faded but make sure not to go through the paint layer. This might take up to five minutes depending on the scratch and your speed and pressure. Do not buff in the same spot for more than a second. You will scratch into the next layer if you buff in the same spot too long.  Use clean water and a towel to remove the leftover compound residue from the paint surface. If the compound got in any crevices, use a toothbrush to clean it out./images/thumb/c/ca/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-9-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/c/ca/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-9-Version-2.jpg           Always wipe off the leftover rubbing compound immediately after buffing. The residue will adhere to the paint and be more difficult to remove otherwise.  Apply a good quality carnauba wax to the surface and then buff the surface with a random orbital buffer. /images/thumb/d/d7/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-10-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/d/d7/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-10-Version-2.jpg           If you wax your car regularly, use your usual method. If you have never done it before, consult How to Wax You Car for suggestions on how to do it.  Make sure all of the scratches are gone and that the repaired area is super shiny and repels water easily. /images/thumb/c/c8/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-11-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/c/c8/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-11-Version-2.jpg	Determine if the scratch is actually a scratch and not just something on the surface of the paint. Establish the depth of the scratch. Look for other areas to repair at the same time. Wash and dry the car thoroughly. Sand the scratch lightly. Rinse the area, making sure that it is clean and dry. Apply rubbing compound to the scratched areas. Polish the area with the rubbing compound. Wash the area once again. Wax the area to seal the paint you have repaired. Finish by washing the area one more time.
These starters are less expensive and inexpensive to have installed. Multiple-button car starters start your SUV and can lock and unlock doors. Some multiple-button starters are equipped to turn on window defrosters and seat warmers. These are more expensive than single-button starters and are more prone to technical problems, but provide a higher level of convenience.; ,   Mechanics recommend getting a remote automobile starter with a warranty that will last as long as you expect to own your SUV. Buy a car starter with a warranty package that protects against faulty installation or electrical malfunctions.    The specialists that sell you your starter are well-trained in the installation process. There will be an additional fee for installation, but you can be assured that the starter will be installed properly.    Remote starters vary in transmission range. Inexpensive single-button starters typically have a range of 100 (30 m), while more intricate starters can have a range of up to 1,000 feet (300 m). Consider where you typically park your SUV at home, work and when shopping to determine what range will work best for you.    A hood safety switch is an optional safety feature that can be installed with most remote car starters. It prevents the starter from starting your SUV when the vehicle's hood is up. Many car specialists opt not to install the hood safety switch unless specifically requested. Be sure to ask about this feature when you're having your starter installed.    Starters with engine speed detection can read a car's engine RPMs, or revolutions per minute. This will allow your starter to detect if the SUV fails to start when prompted due to cold weather or engine malfunction. Starters with this feature can also turn your SUV off if it is detected that the engine is running too fast, preventing engine damage.	Choose a single- or multiple-button starter   Single-button remote car starters function solely to start the SUV when you're not in it. Evaluate warranty options. Install it where you buy it. Check transmitter range. Include a hood safety switch. Purchase engine speed detection.
It can be helpful to start pruning your tomato plant from the bottom and working your way up. This will allow you to keep track of your progress and you'll be able to clearly see what needs to be removed as you work. Carefully work your way up the plant, pruning any non-essential growth away from it.Most of the pruning will take place at the bottom of the plant. Newly formed stems will need to be removed. These stems take nutrients away from your tomato fruits. Many stems on the lower portion of the plant will not yield fruit.; , Most tomato pruning can be done by pinching off whatever part of the plant needs to be removed. Hold the part of the plant between your thumb and index finger before gently snapping the piece away. You may need to move the piece back and forth until it loosens enough to break off.         Most sections of the plant should be easily pinched off. Pruning shears are not needed unless a piece is too big to break away by hand. Using pruning shears can open the plant up to possible infection. If you must cut something from your plant, it's best to use a razor blade.  It's important that you leave enough leaves and stems for the plant to function properly. Cutting away too much of the plant can cause it to grow slowly or possibly die. Removing too many leaves can expose the fruit to the sun and ruin the tomatoes. If you are in doubt about pruning something, it's best to leave it on.It can be a good idea to leave at least one stem on each time you prune. These stems can eventually produce extra tomatoes. You'll want around 4 or 5 stems on your plant that are producing fruit. If tomatoes would be exposed to the sun, it's best to leave stems and leaves on that area to provide shade. Don't remove more than 1/3 of the total plant while pruning.  Pruning your tomatoes will be an ongoing process. New growth will constantly be underway and you'll want to direct that growth to produce the most tomatoes. Keep up with your pruning by removing unwanted growth around once a week.Pruning too often might remove more of the plant than is necessary. Leaving your plant without pruning could allow for unnecessary growth to occur. Harvesting tomatoes often can result in greater yields throughout the life of the plant., There are two main things that will help your tomato pruning efforts: the time of day and the weather. It's recommended that you prune in the mornings, as unwanted stems will break away easier. It's also important that you prune when the plant is dry to prevent any diseases from affecting your tomato plant.  The goal in pruning your tomato plant will be to remove any non-essential foliage or growth. To do this, you will need to know which parts of the plant can be removed and which parts need to remain intact. When pruning your tomato plant, focus on removing these extra parts to help increase the amount of tomatoes produced:Most lower branches can be cut away from the plant. Cut away any new stems that are starting to grow from old ones. Any stems that don't have either flower or fruit can be removed. Snap off any dead or discolored leaves.  It's common for tomato plants to grow upwards instead of of outwards. If your tomato plant has grown too high, you may consider pruning the topmost growth stems. This will prevent the plant from growing upwards, redirecting growth outwards to the tomatoes themselves.Cutting off the top of the plant will prevent all upwards growth. It's a good idea to only do this late in the growing season, before the first frost. Without the top stem in place, your tomato plant will focus growth into the fruit instead of the stems or leaves.  If you are going to grow tomatoes on your patio, you will need to make sure they are the variety you want. There are two main varieties of tomatoes plants: determinate and indeterminate. Determinate tomato plants will grow in a small bush and are generally well suited to planting in a container. Indeterminate tomato plants will grow larger than determinate tomatoes, but can be more challenging to grow in a container.Determinate tomatoes are usually the best type of tomatoes to grow on your patio. Determinate tomato plants will likely not need to be pruned. Indeterminate tomatoes will usually require a wire or wooden stake to grow properly. Indeterminate tomato plants can benefit from pruning.  Your tomato plant will need enough room to grow into. If the container is too small for your plant, it may have difficultly reaching maturity and producing tomatoes. Think about how many tomato plants you want to grow on your patio and select the right size containers for them.The exact amount of room required may vary between types of tomato plants. Always check the recommended space requirements for your tomato plant when considering a container. Most single plant containers will accommodate one tomato plant. Smaller planters will generally result in smaller tomato plants. You can plant multiple tomato plants in one container. However, you will need to make sure each plant has enough room to grow. Larger containers can allow the plant to grow more and may hold more water in the soil.  Not all soil will be ideal for your tomato plant. You'll want to provide the right type of soil for your plant to help it grow quickly and fully. Having the proper soil can also have an effect on the quality of the tomatoes that the plant produces. Keep some of these tips in mind when looking for the best soil for your tomato plants:Use potting soil mixtures when adding soil to your container. Adding in compost can give your plants extra nutrients. Peat moss can be a good addition to your soil mix. Avoid using dirt or soil from your yard, as it may not contain the necessary nutrients or composition.	Start at the bottom of the plant. Remove unwanted stems and leaves. Don't overdo the pruning. Prune your plants once a week. Prune your plants under the best conditions. Know which parts of the plant to prune. Consider cutting off the main growth. Learn the two main types of tomato plants. Get the right size container. Provide the best soil.
If you don't know what direction you're facing, finding constellations can be a struggle. This can inhibit your ability to locate the North Star. Determining which direction is north can allow you to locate the North Star more easily. You can use two sticks to do so.   First, find two sticks. One stick should be slightly bigger than the other.Place the sticks in the ground vertically. Place the taller stick slightly ahead of the shorter one.Lie down in front of the sticks. Line up one eye, forming a straight line between your eye and the two sticks. Wait for a star to appear in your line of vision.Stare at the star for a few minutes and wait for it to move. It if it moves up, you're facing east. If it moves down, you're facing west. If it moves right, you're facing south. It if moves left, you're facing north., If it's daytime, you may still be able to see the North Star. However, you'll be unable to rely on constellations as they're very difficult to see during the day. Instead, you can create a shadow with sticks and use that to locate north.   Place a stick in the ground. Take a stone or other object and place it where the end of the stick's shadow falls.Wait about an hour. The shadow will move, either growing shorter or longer. Place another stick at the end of the new shadow. Then, stand at a perpendicular angle to the shadow. You are now facing north., If you're in an area where moss grows, you can use moss to help you locate north. Look for moss on vertical structures, such as trees. Moss requires a damp atmosphere to grow. This means moss usually grows on the north side of vertical structures, as the north side gets less sun.	Figure out which direction is north using two sticks. Create a shadow with sticks. Pay attention to how moss is growing.
If your plant is indeed infested with spider mites, the leaves may have yellow blotches on them. When light falls on the leaves, you may see a silvered look or even streaks of bronze or silver.   While mites usually attack the underside of leaves, they can sometimes get greedy and also eat the upper side of leaves and flowers. Eventually, the mites will suck holes right through the leaves - providing the most obvious evidence of infestation. Even if you can't find holes in the leaves, your plant may still have spider mites, so keep an eye out for other signs of infestation. Other signs of mite damage include distortion, deformation, wilting, spotting, streaking or discoloration on the surface of the leave. If the mite damage gets particularly bad, the leaves may start to fall off.; , This is a giveaway sign of some spider mites. The webbing usually clusters around feeding areas. Note that not all species of spider mite will produce webbing though.  Spider mites are so small, they can be very difficult to see. However, one method you can use to confirm their presence is to take a sheet of white paper, place it beneath the plant you suspect to be infested and and lightly shake the stem of one of the leaves.   A certain number of the spider mites should fall onto the paper. They can be viewed more easily with a magnifying glass. Spider mites come in a variety of colors, including red, green, yellow and brown. They have eight legs and tend to move quite slowly. Be on the lookout for spider mites with spots on their backs - these are known as two-spotted spider mites and can be particularly hard to get rid of., There are some plants which spider mites seem to favor more than others.   In particular, pay attention to possible infestations on miniature roses, fruit trees, bananas, potted begonias, beans, mint, broad-leafed weeds, strawberries, frangipani and indoor houseplants. Be aware that the two-spotted spider mite has been known to infest over 100 different species of plant.  These are the conditions where spider mites can cause the most damage, as they are thirsty and are seeking moisture from the leaves of the plant. This also means they are very attracted to anything grown under glass, including plants sitting inside on your windowsills.	Look at the surface of the leaves. Check for white webbing on the plant. Confirm the presence of spider mites. Be particularly vigilant with certain species of plants. Be especially alert during dry and dusty weather conditions.
; ,,   If you are inside. Stay there. Move under a desk, strong table, or along in interior wall. Avoid windows, large mirrors, or large furniture that could fall on you.       If you are outside, move to an open area where objects are not likely to fall on you.       If you are driving, slow down smoothly and stop at the side of the road. If possible, don't stop on or under a bridge. ,, If the building you has more than minor damage, move outside.  Open doors and windows on the way. Shut off the gas at the meter if you can. Notify the gas company or fire department if you can't shut off the meter. Don't use any electrical appliances. ,, Aftershocks are common events. Sometimes they are small and few, other times they are large and many, we just can't say yet what might happen.	Don't Panic. If you are cooking, turn off the stove.  , Move to a safe location. After the shaking stops take a 10 deep breaths nice and slow and check yourself for injuries.  , Look after the safety of those around you.  , Check for damage. If you smell or hear a gas leak, get everyone outside. If the power is out and the building is safe, unplug appliances so they won't be damaged when the power comes back on.  , Help others, the means locating, providing first aid, comfort, and water, food, and shelter.  , Prepare for more shaking, possibly even a good time to pitch a tent outside.
Use the Control wheel or stick to control the bank of the airplane. If the airplane is in a bank to the right rotate the wheel (or push the stick) to the left to level the wings. Vice versa if the airplane is banked to the left. It is difficult to tell if the airplane is banked by looking forward. Look at the wingtips to determine if the airplane is banked. When both wing tips are equal distant from the horizon your wings are level.  Pushing forward on the control wheel or stick will move the nose down and pulling will move the nose up. Pick a point on the windshield to hold the horizon. Make sure the wings are still level from the previous step. If the wings are not level this can affect your perspective of pitch especially if you are not sitting in the middle of the airplane such as in side by side seating., Use the rudder pedals to control yaw. If you feel that you are sliding to the left in your seat step on the left rudder pedal, and if you feel you are sliding to the right step on the right rudder pedal . You should feel as if you are getting pushed straight down through the seat at all times! Most airplanes have a small ball on the instrument panel known as inclinometer. There is saying "step on the ball" which means if the ball is on the left apply more left rudder pedal pressure and if it is on the right apply more right rudder pedal pressure. Many airplanes will require at least little bit of constant pressure on one pedal (even in straight and level flight) or another so it might help to try to keep only one foot on the rudder pedals at any one time, and vary the amount of pressure on that pedal., Once you are able to do all of the above at the same time it's time to move on to the next tasks. Also, make small corrections. Small corrections means that even if the airplane is not exactly where you want it as long as its getting there don't add in any more additional control inputs. After you have developed some skill then you can become more aggressive., For a given pitch attitude (where the horizon is on the windshield) and power setting (the throttle position) there will be a corresponding airspeed. While either power or pitch can be used to control airspeed, airspeed can be controlled more accurately with the use of pitch. To increase speed, pitch down. To decrease speed, pitch up. You will find to hold a specific pitch attitude you may need to hold considerable force on the stick use the trim to relieve these forces. If you feel that you are constantly holding the nose up use some nose up trim. If you feel you are constantly holding the nose down use nose down trim. Don't be afraid of the trim use as much or as little as you want. When you are trimmed correctly it should feel as if the nose would not move if you were to let go of the control wheel or stick., After making a pitch change it will take a few seconds for the airplane to accelerate. Lower the nose, wait, check the airspeed, make another SMALL correction, wait, check the airspeed. As the airspeed changes you will also need to make trim changes too., If you are below the desired altitude add some power (increase throttle). You will need to establish a higher pitch attitude to maintain the airspeed. If it looks like you are climbing you do not need to do anything more as long as you are moving to your desired altitude., If you are too high reduce power. You will need to lower the pitch attitude again to maintain airspeed. Remember only change the power enough to get you moving in the right direction., Maintain level flight by "tweaking" the power ever so slightly so that the airplane does not climb or descend.

Divide the total number of watts by 120 (or 240 for a 240-Volt circuit). The result is the maximum current, in amperes (amps), for the circuit.; ,   Select a 14 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 15 amps. Select a 12 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 20 amps. Select a 10 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 30 amps. Select an 8 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 50 amps.    You must use a circuit breaker that is approved for use in your service panel. In most cases, you must use a circuit breaker made by the same manufacturer as that of the service panel. Select a circuit breaker with a current rating that does not exceed the rating of the circuit. For example, if a circuit is wired with a 12 AWG conductor, only use a circuit breaker rated for 20 amps or less.  Allow for sufficient cable at the service panel to route the cable to the entry point in the box and then from that point to the farthest destination in box. As a rule of thumb, allow for a length of cable that is 2 to 3 times the height of the box. ,, You must install the new circuit breaker to line up with a pre-punched knockout in the cover. , Place one probe of a voltmeter on the neutral bus bar and place the other probe on the supply bus bar (the bus bar to which the existing circuit breakers are attached). If the voltmeter does not read 0, the power in the service panel is not off and you should not proceed.  Remove the knockout.   Use a hammer and screwdriver to bend the knockout. Grasp the edge of the knockout with pliers and bend it back and forth until it breaks loose.  For safety reasons, select a knockout that is not in close proximity to the live service wires that connect to the main circuit breaker. Remove the knockout.  Use a screwdriver to open the clamp as far as possible. , Strip off the outer jacket of the cable from this point to the end of the cable.   Use a utility knife to carefully cut down the middle of the cable jacket. Peel the jacket apart and pull it off the conductors back to the point where you began your cut. Cut the jacket off with a utility knife. Remove the paper that surrounds the bare copper ground wire.  Route the conductors through the cable clamp until 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the jacketed cable extends through the cable clamp. Tighten the cable clamp. Remove the electrical tape holding the conductor ends together.    Your service panel has separate neutral and ground bus bars if all of the white wires are routed to one bus bar and all of the bare (or green) ground wires are routed to another bus bar. Your service panel does not have separate neutral and ground bus bars if the white and ground conductors are connected to only 1 bus bar.  Cut off any excess conductor with the wire cutter. Loosen a screw in the bus bar, insert the conductor through the hole and firmly tighten the screw.  Cut off any excess conductor. Use a wire stripper to remove approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from the end of the conductor. Loosen a screw in the bus bar, insert the wire in the hole under the screw and firmly tighten the screw.  Cut off any excess conductor. Strip approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from the end of the conductor. Loosen the screw on the circuit breaker and insert the end of the black wire under it and then firmly tighten the screw.   If you are installing a double-pole breaker for a 240-Volt circuit, connect the black wire to either screw connector on the circuit breaker and connect the red wire to the other screw connector.    Set the new breaker switch to the off position. Route the black wire that is connected to the breaker switch from the cable clamp to the location where you will install the breaker. Hold the circuit breaker at an angle and align its connection point with the rail, clip or slot in the service panel. Press the other end of the circuit breaker into place. Some brands will click into place; others will not. To assure that the breaker is properly installed, verify that it is level with the adjacent circuit breakers.  Use a circuit tester or plug in an electrical appliance to test the new circuit.	Determine the maximum power that will be drawn on the new circuit. Select the proper gauge conductor for the maximum current of the circuit. Purchase the correct circuit breaker. Run the electrical cable for the new circuit. Place a rubber mat or sheet of plywood (or other dry wood) in front of the service panel and stand on it while working in the panel.  , Open the cover of the service panel and turn off the main breaker.  , Note the location of unused circuit breaker spaces in the service panel cover. Remove the service panel cover.  , Measure the voltage to verify that the power is off in the service panel. Choose the location in the service panel for the new circuit breaker. Locate a circular knockout on the top, side or bottom of the service panel box that is convenient for entry of the new circuit cable and for routing conductors inside the box to the new circuit breaker location. Install a cable clamp in the circular hole in the service panel box with the clamp on the outside of the box. Route the cable to the new cable clamp.  , Identify the location on the cable that will extend approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside the cable clamp. Wrap electrical tape around the ends of the conductors to hold them together. Determine whether your service panel has separate neutral and ground bus bars. Route the ground conductor to the ground bus bar (or common neutral bus bar, as applicable). Route the white wire to the neutral bus bar. Determine how you will route the black wire to the location for the new circuit breaker. Install the circuit breaker. Test your installation by first turning on the main breaker in the service panel and then turning on the new circuit breaker. Replace the breaker panel cover.

Overwatering is a very common mistake people make with indoor plants. Make sure to read an almanac or ask someone at a local greenhouse about the precise amount of water you plants need. If you notice your soil appears water logged, you are overwatering and should reduce the amount of water your plant is receiving.Overwatering can be confusing, as the symptoms can mimic those of under watering. The plant may look wilted and yellow. In extreme cases, the plant may collapse. If you've been watering your plant daily, and the soil is noticeably moist, the issue is probably over watering and not under watering. How often a plant needs to be watered depends on the humidity of your home and how much sun it's getting. Only water herbs when the soil surrounding them is dry to the touch., You should not select just any soil for an herb garden, and it's not always best to take soil from outdoors. Instead, purchase a high quality potting mix from a local greenhouse.Make sure to select a mix that is specifically used for potted plants. Mixes designed for outdoor plants will be too heavy and will dry out too easily. With the right soil, monitoring things like pH levels is unnecessary. A quality potting soil should already have the right nutrients and the label should provide suggestions for things like fertilizers. With parsley, be careful of getting soil on your leaves themselves. Outdoors, parsley frequently gets muddied with soil during heavy rainfall. When planting parsley in new soil, be careful not to get soil on the leaves. Gently wipe off any soil that gets on your parsley., Not all herbs will work in certain situations. Some herbs may not thrive indoors as well as others. Review the herbs you're using and be honest with yourself about whether they work for your specific situation.If you can't provide more than 2 to 4 hours a day of natural sunlight, this limits the types of plants you can grow. Luckily, mint, cilantro, parsley, wasabi, and wild garlic can thrive in the shade.If you have access to a lot of natural light year round, you should be able to grow most herbs indoors without a problem.  Chlorosis is a common problem people encounter when growing herbs indoors. It can be spotted if the leaves turn yellow while the veins of the plant remain green. Usually, this is due to poor drainage. You can spot poor drainage if your soil looks like sludge.Install another drainage hole in your pot if you notice poor drainage. You also may need to water less if your plant is displaying signs of being overwatered. If you've ruled out poor drainage, your soil may have an iron deficiency. This can be solved by purchasing chelated iron at a local greenhouse. Follow the instructions on the package for use.  Burnt tips are when the tips of your plant look brown or black. This is usually an indication you're over-fertilizing. If you notice burnt tips, cut back on your fertilizer.Usually, the salt in fertilizer is the culprit with burnt tips. To return the soil to a better state, water the pot until water begins flowing quickly from drainage holes.	Watch for symptoms of overwatering. Make sure you're using the right soil. Switch the type of plant you're using. Address chlorosis quickly. Lower your use of fertilizer if you notice your leaves' tips burning.
Make sure to poke at the corners so that they will completely un-bunch.  Feel free to decorate the outside with fabric markers, gems, buttons, and other appliques.   Note: If you would like handle straps, continue to the "Tips" section.	Finally, turn the whole thing inside out. Congratulations on your new and "totally unique" purse!
Use hand shears to trim any long, unbranched stems. Cut just above the healthy buds on the branch. Do this at a 45 degree angle.This type of pruning will encourage the lower side branches to develop and flourish.  Pinching is an easy way to prune shrubs without making a cut. Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch off any dead buds on the branches or stems of the shrub. This will encourage the shrub to grow bushy and even. You usually pinch small-leaved shrubs to help them maintain an even shape., Shearing helps to produce new growth on a young shrub. To shear the shrub, cut it so it forms a rectangular shape that is slightly wider at the top. Do this by cutting near the buds at a 45 degree angle.Shearing can be done using hand shears or a pruning saw. If you are shearing a tall shrub, use pole pruners. This type of pruning will cut right through leaves on the shrub so it should be done on small-leaved shrubs, as the cuts will be less noticeable.  Thinning helps to reduce the bulk of the plant to encourage growth. Start by cutting off any old or wayward branches at a 45 degree angle. Cut them back 1-2 inches. Use hand shears, loppers, or a pruning saw to thin out the shrub.Try to remove stems or branches that have grown beyond the rest of the branches or stems. This will help to open up the middle of the shrub to sunlight, which will keep it healthy.	Head trim shrubs to encourage growth. Pinch off dead buds. Shape the shrub by shearing it. Thin out any old or wayward branches on the shrub.
Daffodils must complete their natural growing cycle after they have bloomed so that they can store enough nutrients to bloom again the following year.; , Simply twist or snip the foliage off before excavating the bulbs. Be careful not to damage the bulbs when you dig them up as bruised bulbs have a greater likelihood of spoiling in storage.  Loosen the soil all the way around each group of bulbs by pushing a shovel or garden fork into the soil about 6" (15cm) away from the stems. , Once the daffodils have been unearthed, all bulbs that show signs of disease should be discarded. This prevents them from contaminating the others.   Damaged bulbs should likewise be tossed because they are not likely to bloom again.  Before removing the roots, brush off the bulbs to remove dirt and outer layers of loose skin.  The bulbs should be allowed to air dry on a tray for a day or so. This hardens them and helps keep them from rotting in storage.  You may want to dust your bulbs with a fungicide, a pesticide, or with both before storing them. This will help keep bugs and disease at bay.  These types of bags allow air circulation and help to prevent rotting. Make sure to store the bags in a well-ventilated place.    Alternatively, you can place the bulbs in boxes and cover them with media—sand, perlite, peat moss, or vermiculite. Pour dry sand or vermiculite into a storage container or cardboard box until it is about one-quarter full, then place the dried daffodil bulbs upside down on the layer and pour several more inches of the vermiculite or sand on top.  Make sure the storage environment has a temperature of about 50-60℉ (10-15℃). Cool temperatures keep the plants in dormancy and prevent them from blooming prematurely.  If you are growing more than one daffodil cultivar and/or other bulb plants, you will need to label the bags to prevent confusion the following spring.  Daffodils need a chilling period of 16 to 18 weeks before the flower becomes fully formed inside the bulb. At that point they're ready for light and warmth.   If you cut the time short, the flowers may emerge but they will not be fully formed.  You should monitor the bulbs to catch any problems that may occur. Remove and discard any unhealthy organic material or diseased bulbs to avoid spread of rot or disease.  Fruits which ripen in the refrigerator emit ethylene, a gaseous hormone. This hormone aids the ripening of fruit and the blooming of flowers. Exposure to this hormone will encourage your bulbs to start the blooming process prematurely, before they've had the necessary chilling period to form the flower. Therefore, make sure that any bulbs that you keep in the refrigerator or kitchen pantry are segregated from ripening fruits.	Remove the bulbs from the ground after the foliage has died back completely. Prune the dead foliage before digging the bulbs. Loosen the soil around the bulbs. Lift the bulbs up out of the soil with your shovel or garden fork.  , Discard the diseased bulbs. Trim the roots off the bulbs. Allow the bulbs to dry. Dust your bulbs with insect/disease repelling products. Place daffodil bulbs in netted nylon bags or paper bags for storage. Control the storage conditions carefully. Label your bulbs. Store daffodils in the refrigerator if you live in a warm climate. Check your bulbs periodically. Exclude fruits from the storage area.
Position yourself in a location where there is not bright lighting. You will have a better chance of spotting the Big Dipper in an area not polluted with light.   You also should position yourself in a spot where the northern horizon is clear.Wait until darkness falls. You aren’t going to find the Big Dipper during the daytime. The best viewing time is between March and June and around 10 p.m.; , To find the Big Dipper, you need to look into the northern sky. Determine which direction is north using a magnetic compass or a map. Tilt your head back so that you are looking up at the sky at about a 60-degree angle.   During midsummer and autumn, the Big Dipper will be closer to the horizon, so don't look up quite so high. If you are located north of Little Rock, Arkansas, you should be able to see the Big Dipper all night at any hour and any day of the year.If you live as far north as New York or further north, the Big Dipper should never sink below the horizon. In southern locations, it can be more difficult to see the full Big Dipper in the fall, when some of its stars may be obscured.  The season matters here. If it’s spring or summer, the Big Dipper will be higher in the sky. If it’s fall or winter, the Big Dipper will be closer to the horizon.   The saying “spring up and fall down” will help you remember where to look for the Big Dipper. In the fall, the Big Dipper will rest on the horizon in evening. In the winter, the handle can appear to be dangling from the bowl. You will find the Big Dipper upside down in the spring and, in the summer, the bowl will lean toward the ground.  The Big Dipper is shaped like a bowl and a handle. There are three stars in the Big Dipper’s handle organized in a line. There are 4 stars that make up the Big Dipper’s bowl (it looks like an irregular square). The entire Big Dipper looks somewhat like a kite, with the string being the handle and the bowl being the kite itself.   The last two stars of the Big Dipper’s handle are called the pointers. They are called Dubhe and Merak. The brightest star is Alioth, which is the third star on the handle, closest to the bowl.The tip of the Big Dipper’s handle is called Alkaid. It is a hot star that means “the leader.” It is the third brightest star in Ursa Major and six times bigger than the sun. Mizar is next on the handle after Alkaid. It actually consists of two double stars. Megrez is the star that connects the tail to the base of the bowl. It is the dimmest of the seven stars of the Big Dipper. Phecda is known as the “thigh of the bear.” It is located to the South of Megrez and makes up part of the bow.  If you can find the North Star, you should be able to find the Big Dipper, and vice versa. The North Star is usually bright. To find it, look into the north sky up about one third of the way from the horizon to the top of the sky (which is called the zenith). The North Star is also called Polaris.   The Big Dipper rotates around the North Star through all of the seasons and through the night. The stars of the Big Dipper are as bright as those of the North Star. The North Star is often used for navigation because it points “true north.”The North Star is the brightest star in the Little Dipper and the end of its handle. Trace an imaginary line from the North Star downward, and you should be able to find the two stars in the end of the Big Dipper’s handle, which are called pointer stars because they point toward the Big Dipper. Polaris is about five stars farther away from the distance between the pointer stars themselves.  The Big Dipper is what is called circumpolar. This means it doesn’t rise or set like the sun. Instead, it rotates around the north celestial pole.   Throughout the night, it rotates around the pole, counter-clockwise, bowl first. It makes a complete revolution around the pole once per sidereal day. A sidereal day is defined as four minutes shorter than the standard 24-hour day. Thus, you can use the Big Dipper’s rotations to keep track of time., Some Native Americans saw the bowl of the Big Dipper as a bear. The stars of the handle were three warriors chasing it.Other Native Americans saw the Big Dipper’s bowl as the bear’s flank and its handle as the bear’s tail. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Big Dipper is called “Plough,” which derives from Nordic stargazing in which the Big Dipper was believed to be the chief god, Odin’s, wagon or chariot. In Danish, they call it “Karlsvogna” or Charles wagon. Various cultures see the Big Dipper as something different. In China, Japan, and Korea, it’s a ladle. In northern England, a cleaver, in Germany and Hungary, a cart, and in the Netherlands, a saucepan. It’s a salmon net in Finland and a coffin in Saudi Arabia. Escaped American slaves found their way to freedom in the north along the Underground Railroad by being told to “follow the drinking Gourd.” Thus, the Big Dipper was used as a navigational method. The Micmacs of Canada saw the Big Dipper bowl as being a celestial bear, with the three stars of its handle being hunters chasing the bear.  The stars that make up the Big Dipper are part of the Ursa Major Moving Cluster. The furthest star from earth, Alkaid, makes up the handle and is 210 light years from earth.   The other stars are Dubhe (105 light-years from earth); Phecda (90 light-years); Mizar (88 light-years); Merak (78 light-years); Alioth (68 light-years); and Megrez (63 light-years). These starts are in motion. Thus, in about 50,000 years, the Big Dipper will no longer retain the same shape.  Once you’ve found the Big Dipper, you should be able to easily spot the little Dipper.   Remember that the two farthest most stars in the Big Dipper’s handle point to the North Star. The North Star is the first star in the handle of the Little Dipper. The Little Dipper is not as bright as the Big Dipper. It looks similar to the Big Dipper, though. It has a handle made up of three stars that connects to a four-star bowl. It is harder to find the Little Dipper because the stars are not as bright in it, especially if you are in a city.  The Big Dipper is what is called an asterism. That means it is a pattern of stars that is not a constellation. It is part of the constellation Ursa Major, the Big Bear.   The Big Dipper stars are the bear’s tail and hindquarters. The Ursa Major constellation can be best seen in April at around 9 p.m. Using a drawing for reference (there are many online) should help you sketch out the rest of the stars that form the Big Bear once you find the Big Dipper.Ursa Major is the third largest constellation and one of 88 official constellations.

Wring out the excess, then wipe the brass with the damp cloth using small circular motions.   Lacquer is a protective coating, and for lacquered pieces, most mild to moderate dullness can be buffed out with physical means rather than chemical ones. In fact, if you use a household cleaner or other type of polish, you risk ruining the lacquer coating. Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.; , If the lacquered brass still appears somewhat dull, take a dry cloth and buff the surface for several minutes, working across the entire surface in small, circular motions.   For this part of the process, you could consider using either cotton cloth or jewellers' cloth. Jewellers' cloth has an outer layer of soft flannelet and an inner layer of flannel with bits of hematite embedded into it. This hematite acts as a fine abrasive. Note that if you do use jewellers' cloth, you should buff with the abrasive side first and follow up by buffing with the non-abrasive side to remove and residue left behind by the hematite.  At this point, the brass should appear fairly polished. If it still looks tarnished and dull, however, you may need to strip the lacquer completely and clean the brass more thoroughly.	Wipe the brass with a soft, damp cloth.Run a soft rag under lukewarm water. Buff gently with a dry cloth. Assess the brass.
Horticultural oils are oil-based products that smother insects and their eggs. You can purchase horticultural oil at a home and gardening store or online.Before diluting the horticultural oil, make sure to read the instructions that came with it so that you know how much water you should use and whether it's safe to use on your plants.Use traditional horticultural oil in the summer. Use dormant horticultural oil in the fall and spring., Horticultural oil may be affected by rain or high humidity and moving them inside will help prevent this. Avoid using horticultural oil on maple trees, hickory trees, cryptomeria, and spruce trees and read the instructions to make sure that they are safe to use on your plants., Since water and oil separate, it's important that you shake the bottle regularly as you use it. Saturate the top and bottom of the leaves with the oil. Allow the oil to soak in and kill the mites and their eggs.Horticultural oil works by suffocating the mites, so it's important you get complete coverage. Do not use the oils on flowers because it could damage them.  Check for spider mites periodically throughout the rest of the week. If you notice that mites are still hatching, spray the plant down again.	Dilute horticultural oil with warm water in a spray bottle. Move the plants with the mites inside a garage or shed. Throughly spray the plants with the oil. Spray every 2-3 weeks until the mites are dead.
Hardness refers to the ease with which the wire can be shaped, scored, indented, or pitted. Hardness impacts the final look or sheen of a wire project and can impact on how well the project presents. If you are using copper or aluminium, you are working with soft metals, whereas iron is hard.; , Ductility refers to the ability of a metal to be turned into a wire width. Finer wires are made from the most ductile metals, and less ductile metals produce thicker wires. The order of ductility is (most to least):   Gold Silver Platinum Iron Copper Aluminium Zinc Tin Lead  , Malleability refers to the ability of the metal to be flattened without breaking or splitting. This is often a very important aspect of wire work! If you are not sure, always practise on a test piece first and hammer it flat to see what happens. The order of malleability is as follows (most malleable to least):   Gold (so malleable it can be made into foil and gold leaf for cakes) Silver Aluminium Copper Tin Platinum Lead Zinc Iron  , Rigidity is the opposite of malleability. It will be important in some projects that your wire does not have any give so that the shape of the project is maintained for a long duration.  Tensile strength refers to how much stress a wire can take when stretched at either end. This can be important for stretched jewellery projects, or for sculptures that require balancing or holding up of some elements. Copper has an excellent tensile strength.  When purchasing your wire, it can come in a variety of possible shapes, such as round, half-round, square, and flat. Also, you will need to familiarise yourself with the differing gauges of wire available. The thinness and thickness of the wire you choose will be dependent on the projects you are making. Visit a store and check them out, feel them and see what works for you. It can help to purchase a range of samples to play around with in your workshop to see what works best for your creativity.	Check the hardness of the wire. Consider the ductility of the wire. Get used to malleability as a key element for wire work. Consider the rigidity of the wire. Learn about tensile strength of wire. Learn about the different wire shapes.
Before learning how to read Ulysses, you have to know what you're getting into. Ulysses comprises 18 "Episodes". Each of these episodes was serialized separately, and each one reads completely differently. For example, Episode 14 parodies all of the great authors of the English language, going from Chaucer to Dickens, and Episode 18 is a lengthy monologue of about 10,000 words that comprises two giant run-on sentences. Every Episode reads like a completely different book, and therein lies the beauty of Ulysses.; , When doing a formal, academic study of Ulysses, you should buy some form of guidebook. These books are about four hundred pages thick and explain Ulysses line by line. This is good because Ulysses is full of esoteric puns and references, and the guidebooks explain it all. However, switching from guidebook to guidebook over and over is very annoying. The best way to read Ulysses, if you're trying to read it for fun, is to just dive right in, saving all of those guidebooks for a college course.  No, really, this 700 page text is hilarious. The entire idea of the novel is that Joyce is taking the epic heroes of The Odyssey and turning them into these pathetic Dubliners. The end of Episode 4 features a ten page poop joke written in the same elevated language as The Odyssey. Understanding that every sentence has some form of joke in it, be it some esoteric reference to literature or a subtle pun, turns Ulysses into a very intelligent comedy.  But that's mostly because Joyce designed it that way. Part of the joke is that you're not going to get everything, and there's humor in that. Laugh whenever you don't get something, because you've just walked into one of the most brilliant practical jokes in literature.  Because each chapter is written differently, it takes a few pages to get into the rhythm of each episode.  Since each episode has a different style, knowing what to appreciate beforehand can help. As such, here is a list of all of the episodes and their brand of comedy.   Episode 1: Normal novel. Episode 2: An informal catechism. Episode 3: Elitist masculine monologue. Episode 4: Poking fun at the great heroes of yore. Episode 5: The hypnotic nature of religion. Episode 6: Death. Episode 7: Making fun of journalism (it's written like a newspaper; pay attention to the headlines). Episode 8: Food puns, everything can be eaten and everything eats in this chapter. Episode 9: Making fun of Hamlet and elitists who debate over obscure pieces of literature (very much so making fun of certain scholars who would later analyze Ulysses). Episode 10: This chapter has nothing to do with the main characters. It is instead presented as a bunch of short stories surrounding the side characters. The humor comes in the fact that it is largely pointless and that most of the side characters make fun of the main characters. Episode 11: Everything is a music pun. A lot of onomatopoeia is used. Episode 12: There are two narrators: one who is hyper-colloquial to the point of not making sense, and one who is hyper-scientific to the point of not making sense. The competition between the narrators produces the comedy. Episode 13: Narrated by a young girl, and everything is a sex joke. Episode 14: An elaborate parody of all the great English authors. Episode 15: Written as a hallucinatory play in the red light district. Episode 16: This chapter is super ambiguous, and the comedy comes from mistaking characters for other characters. Episode 17: Written as a catechism, the comedy comes from the hyper-scientific question and answer format being applied to the mundane. Episode 18: Streaming consciousness of Bloom's wife.  Joyce wrote two graphic organizers. They are called the schemas. Use them to introduce yourself to the chapter. They can be found here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linati_schema_for_Ulysses and here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_schema_for_Ulysses  , In an Irish accent, preferably. A lot of the puns make more sense when heard.  Reading this novel is difficult, so you have to set up a schedule for yourself or you'll give up.  A lot of Ulysses makes fun of Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, so reading them beforehand allows you to practice reading Joyce's style and give you background knowledge for some of Joyce's jokes.  When you get a joke, write it down in the margins. It'll help you comprehend other similar jokes.  This is a work of comic fiction. Laugh aloud. Laugh at everything. It's funny.	Understand Ulysses. Don't use a guidebook. Understand that it's funny. You're not going to understand everything. Take your time with each chapter. Know your episode. Use the schemas. Read it aloud. Set up a schedule. Read James Joyce's other works beforehand. Annotate. Laugh.
It is necessary to properly identify the weed before purchasing herbicide. Different species and types require different herbicides. If you are unsure of the weed, call your county extension office or an herbicide dealer to make sure you buy the effective herbicide. Make sure you understand the effects and implications of applying an herbicide before doing so. Read the label on your herbicide to understand the restrictions and wait time on boating, swimming, and fishing before applying. This may be an important factor when choosing an herbicide. Herbicide comes in both liquid and solid form, as sprays or granules. For algal weed control, consider using copper sulfates or copper chelates, such as Cutrine Plus. These can be applied directly to the infested area as per the instructions on the label. For certain submersed plants, such as pond weeds, and free-floating plants, such as duckweed, consider using a diquat or fluridone. Rooted-floating plants, such as water-lilies, and emergent plants, such as cattails, are best treated with glyphosate. Check your local and state regulations before using herbicides in a body of water. Permits are required for some types of applications.  Herbicides are best applied in late spring when plants are youngest and weakest. If you wait until late summer when vegetation is thick, you risk major fish kills by depleting oxygen all at once. Apply when water temperatures are in the upper 60s (Fahrenheit). Herbicides do not work effectively when the water is too cold. , Make sure that you are using the proper dose when applying herbicide. The herbicide label will describe how to calculate dosage. Dosage is usually measured based on acre-feet, which can be determined by multiplying the surface area acreage by the average depth. The label will then tell you how much to apply based on this measurement. Never apply a larger dose than listed on the label. , Herbicides will need to be reapplied in subsequent years to come. Underlying seeds are unaffected by herbicides and will therefore emerge the next year despite initial treatment. Make sure to continue to apply in the spring to treat any structures that lay dormant in the winter.	Choose the correct herbicide. Apply under the proper conditions. Dose properly. Reapply as needed.
; , Begin preparing an hour or at least 10mins in advance.   Run for 10 minutes, and then stretch your muscles all over your body for 15 minutes. Do yoga stretches and the stretches you do in dance class, switch it up a little.  Eat a good meal about an hour before class, preferably something healthy. You will feel that pizza in your stomach when you dance.  See if the room is open for you to go in. If it is practice dance or combinations, you are learning to refresh them in your mind.  If you do a leap, give it all you got. If you do a tendu, keep your legs tight and your knee turned out. In everything you do, do it to the very very best of your ability.  If you like ballet, try a little jazz or hip hop, or vice versa. Then, still having form, come up with your own little ways of doing moves. Explore your mind.  If you were in a theatrical play, think of something you could pretend to be doing while doing that move. For example, when you arabesque, act as if you were young again and leaping into the air to grab lightning bugs. You get the idea... Just be yourself, and let only yourself be expressed when you dance!  , Dance is as much for others as it is for the performer.	Pick your classes well: Make sure the place you take classes at or the company you are in is a place where you really can be yourself and connect with the teachers and other students. Do warm up before start: Before starting on with the dance, it pays off to stretch or warm up as it loosens the stiffness in the body. Drink water. Time your travel: Get to the studio a few minutes early. Concentrate: When class begins, clear your mind of everything, except what you are making your body do. Let yourself free: To be creative in your dancing, find your own style. Understand the steps: When you are doing a move, think of something else that it reminds you of. Maintain your posture: You must hold your chin up, your belly in and a smile on your face as you dance.
It is multiple types of mold (including black mold) growing in the internal drain hose inside your washer where you can’t see it.; , Search "mold growth" and you will see that the biggest problem is high humidity (over 60%). This chart shows you at what relative humidity mold starts to grow. It starts at around 55% and by the time you get to 70% the chance of mold growth is close to 100%. Because it starts growing at about 55% we highly recommend you keep your relative humidity (RH) of your laundry area under 50% at all times. A dehumidifier is the best way to lower your RH.  They will just help with the odor for a little while. This picture is of the internal drain hose inside your washer where the black mold starts to grow. The internal drain hose should look milk-jug clear, unless it is a grey hose. Where the pipe looks dark is the black mold inside the pipe. Most internal drain hoses are ribbed pipes and once the mold starts to grow it is very difficult to clean it out. When you just occasionally use special cleaners you are not solving what caused the mold to start growing to start with. This is why a washer fan is so important in permanently eliminating washer odor.  In this case you need to lower the humidity level inside your washer drum below 50%. You can do this with a washer fan. You can purchase one online; just search the internet for "washer fan". You can install it yourself in seconds and there are videos on the website showing you how to do it. You can permanently fix the problem rather than covering it up.  This allows the air being pushed into the drum to be exhausted out the front. As air exhausts out the front, it brings high RH with it and thereby lowers the humidity level inside the drum.  Using too much soap only feeds the mold and can also wear out your washer prematurely. This image is the backside of the inner drum of a Whirlpool Duet washer that is about 5 years old. When you use too much soap (especially dry granular soap) it builds up over time and keeps parts of the washer wet continually. This leads to premature failure of your machine.  You can find details about your particular washer online, as some owner’s manuals do not cover how to do this. Debris and biofilm trapped in your washer’s water pump filter can add to the odor problem. There are lots of videos online showing you how to get at your particular washer’s clean out and how to clean it out.	Understand what causes the smell to begin with. Understand why it grows there. Understand that cleaning your washer and leaving the door open will never solve the problem. In order to stop the mold from growing, you have to remove at least one of the 4 components to mold growth. Once you have installed your washer fan, just simply leave the door slightly open when you are not running your washer. Make sure to not use too much laundry detergent. Clean out your washer’s water pump filter periodically, as things do get caught in there from time to time.
Digital tuners are usually small, battery powered devices with microphones able to pick up the notes of your guitar. Turn it on, then play an open E string. A light will flash when the string is tuned to the correct note. Adjust the string if necessary until the note is in tune, then repeat with the other strings.If you have an electric guitar, you can usually plug a cord directly into the tuner to check your tuning, instead of using the tuner’s microphone.; , There are many guitar tuner apps available, and with smartphones at everyone’s fingertips, these can be a great option to keep things simple or to use when you don’t have another tuner. These apps work similarly to digital tuners, using your smartphone’s built-in microphone.Play an open E string and adjust until your app shows the note is at the correct pitch. Repeat for the other strings.  If you use effects pedals with your electric guitar, there are models that work just like one of these. Instead of altering the guitar’s tone when you activate them, they serve as a digital tuner. Many also allow you to tune silently, which is a great option, particularly if you are playing live. Play an open string, and the tuner will light up to indicate when the pitch is correct.Many multi-effects units include built-in tuners.  These clamp directly to your guitar’s headstock, and you can leave them in place while you play. Instead of picking up the tones with a microphone, they detect the notes by the vibrations running through the guitar’s wood. Play each string you want to tune, and the tuner will alert you when the note is correct., If you’re sitting near a computer, you can easily find a guitar tuner online by searching for one. Most tuner sites allow you to select the string you want to tune, listen to a tone of the correct pitch, and adjust the string as needed until it sounds the same.This method does not use a microphone. You’ll just have to rely on your ear to make sure the notes played on the web browser match the open guitar strings, adjusting as needed. If you can’t access an online tuner, you can also strike a set of tuning forks or blow a slide whistle. Adjust each guitar string until it matches to pitch of the corresponding tuning fork or note on a slide whistle.	Use a digital tuner for a quick and easy option. Try a tuner app for convenience. Add a tuner to your stomp box rig. Snap on a headstock tuner. Open a browser and use an online tuner.
You have a few choices when it comes to kitchen window treatments.   Curtains. These are 2 gathered panels that hang from top to bottom, framing the window on both the left and right sides. Valances. A valance is a panel that spans horizontally over the only the upper portion of the window, leaving the lower part of the window undressed. Privacy tiers. Tiers are single-panel window treatments designed to block only the lower 1/2 or 2/3 of the window. They are often used in combination with a valance.; , Record the measurements for your window's length and width. If you want to create a privacy tier, also measure the distance from the vertical center-point to the bottom of the window.  This will determine how much fabric you need to purchase. Generally speaking, the fuller the curtain, the more opulent it feels. A fullness of 1 1/2 equates to a flat panel and a fullness of 3 is a luxuriously gathered panel.  Follow these guidelines to calculate the yardage of fabric that you will need.   Multiply your fullness (1 1/2 to 3) by the width of your window. For example, if your window is 2 foot (0.6 m), then you will need a 4 foot (1.2 m) length of fabric for each full-sized panel you intend to create. Remember that a valance and a privacy tier are each one full-sized panel. If you are planning to sew curtains, your panel length will be 1/2 of the full-sized panel length and you will need 2 panels per window. Add at least 2 inches (5 cm) to the width and 6 inches (15 cm) to the length of your valance, tier or curtain design to account for seams, rod pockets and hems. You may adjust that number, depending on your design and the size of your rod.  When you make kitchen curtains, you must keep in mind the practicality factor. You should not use any fabric that will shrink or fade easily, or that cannot be washed. It is also a good idea to choose a flame-retardant fabric, just in case of cooking mishap. ,,,   Fold the lower edge of your panel up 0.5 inch (1.25 cm), wrong side in, and press. Fold the clean edge up, facing the wrong side of the fabric, to the desired hem amount (keeping in mind the amount you allotted when you cut your panel) and press again. Stitch the top folded edge of the hem to secure it in place.    Fold the vertical edges 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) on each side, wrong side in, and press. Double the fold to conceal the rough edge and press again. Sew along the edge of the fold to secure the hem.    Fold the upper edge of your panel in 0.5 inch (1.25 cm), wrong side in, and press. Fold the clean edge under (wrong side in) again, allowing enough room to compensate for the width of the rod you will be using, and press again. Stitch as near to the folded edge as possible to finish the rod pocket. Once you finish this step, your panel is complete.	Determine the type of window treatment you want. Measure your window. Decide on the fullness for your kitchen window treatments. Determine the amount of fabric you will need. Choose a fabric. Lay fabric out and iron it on a flat surface.  , Use a measuring tape and straight edge to outline the dimensions of your panels on the fabric with a fabric marker.  , Cut out your panels.  , Create the lower hem. Finish the right and left rough edges. Create the rod pocket. Finished.
(The gel crystals are available at craft stores). Heat on "high" for three minutes to dry the crystals as much as possible.  The glass must be wide enough to accommodate the flower you're drying.  Cut enough so that only an inch (2.5cm) remains attached to the flower. Stick the stem into the crystals so that the blossom stands upright.  Keep pouring until the flower is completely covered.  Cook for 1 minute 45 seconds for rosebuds or up to 4 or 5 minutes for larger blossoms.  Gently pour off the crystals once cooled. Clean the flower petals carefully with a fine paintbrush, then mist lightly with an acrylic spray. The flowers can now be used for display or artwork.	Line a microwave-safe container with a bed of silica gel crystals. Pour an inch/2.5cm of warm crystals into a heavy glass. Snip the flower stem. Gradually pour the remaining warm crystals down the side of the glass. Microwave at "high". Cool the buds for 20 minutes.
If you received a ticket that says “US District Court Violation Notice” at the top, then you have a ticket from some federal agency or bureau. If the ticket does not have that heading, then you need to read it carefully and determine what its source is, but it is probably not a federal agency.Compare your ticket to the sample that you can view at http://www.cvb.uscourts.gov/sample.html.  A federal speeding ticket will be issued from a federal police force, agency, or military organization. State agencies are not the same thing. Some of the more common federal units that may be responsible for a federal speeding ticket would be:U.S. Park Police U.S. Fish & Wildlife Department of Defense Police U.S. Coast Guard U.S. Provost Marshal Air Force, Marines & Navy Security Forces U.S. Postal Police U.S. Customs U.S. Border Police Veterans Affairs (V.A.) Police.  You are most likely to receive a federal speeding ticket if you are on or near property that is owned and controlled by the federal government. This would include such places as:federal buildings national parks military installations post offices Veteran Affairs medical centers national wildlife refuges national forests.	Look for the “US District Court Violation Notice” heading. Check for the name of the agency or bureau that issued the ticket. Think about where the ticket was issued.
Think about the objects or images that carry meaning for you. Make a list of all of these objects and images. If you are designing a symbol for your product, then try to think about what images best represent your product.   Keep in mind that your symbol does not need to be a literal representation of your product, but it should have a strong connection with your brand. For example, having a shoe as your symbol might be too literal if your product is shoes. Instead, you might represent what the shoes allow wearers to do with your symbol, such as run faster or enjoy the outdoors more. If you are designing a personal symbol, then focus on images or objects that might represent important aspects of your personality, heritage, or the message that you want to send.For example, if you are Irish you might incorporate the shamrock or some elements of Celtic design into your symbol.; , Gather some materials for sketching such as paper, pens or pencils, and draw a rough sketch of each of the images or objects you listed. The sketches don't have to be perfect, but remember you want your symbol to send a clear message to people who see it.   As you sketch, try to keep your goals for the symbol in mind. What message do you want to send?  , After you finish your sketches, look over them and think about which one is the most effective. If you are creating a symbol for your business, then the image should be something that is eye catching and easy to recognize. Try to pick the image that you feel has the strongest impact.Try showing your sketches to different people and see which one they prefer. Make sure to ask them why they prefer this image as well. You can use the input to adjust your symbol if needed.  Simplicity is key in creating an effective symbol. Try not to over design your symbol with lots of embellishments and details. Remove any unnecessary detail or anything visually distracting. Once you have identified any unnecessary or distracting elements, you can either erase them or start over.Some examples of simple yet effective symbols include the Nike swoosh, the Olympic rings, and the Microsoft windows.  The color of your symbol can also have a strong effect on the way that people perceive the symbol. Familiarizing yourself with basic color theory can help you to come up with a harmonious and visually arresting symbol.   If you are using multiple colors in your symbol design, then make sure that they complement one another. For example, you might chose two polar opposites such as black and white, or two shades of one color, such as light blue and dark blue. Other colors can be jarring if placed beside each other, such as orange and pink.Experts in the psychology of color argue that we have emotional responses to certain colors.Consider this when choosing colors for your symbol. For example, red can signify energy, power, passion, anger, and blood., When you have finished creating your symbol, take a closer look at it and try to determine if there is anything else that might improve it. Some questions you might ask yourself include:   Is it simple and appealing? Does it communicate your message well? Do the colors work? Is there anything (big or small) that you’d like to change about it?	Think about what you want to symbolize. Sketch two or three of these objects. Pick the image that works best for your product. Keep it simple. Pay attention to color. Evaluate your final symbol.
Look for painted lines on the roadway that indicate a safe crosswalk that allows pedestrians to cross the street. In the United States, these will always be painted in white and perpendicular to the street. If you are in another country, you may have a different system in place; check with your local transportation department for more information.   Some crosswalks use several rectangular “blocks” of paint to indicate where you should walk across, while others use two parallel lines to designate the crossing area. You will typically find crosswalks at an intersection with another street, or sometimes in the middle of a block in very high foot traffic areas.; , Look for a button to press near a crosswalk that signals the WALK/DON’T WALK pedestrian lights to change. When available, these buttons are necessary to use in order to cross safely.   Once you’ve pressed the button to initiate the pedestrian signals, wait patiently on the sidewalk or curb for the signal to change to WALK, or whatever symbol is used in your area to indicate it is safe to cross. If there is no pedestrian-initiated button, cross with extra caution when the regular traffic light turns to green, or when vehicles at stop signs see you and allow you to cross.  Cross the street only when the pedestrian signal changes to white letters that say WALK, a white symbol of a person walking, or another symbol used in your area to indicate “walk.” Look both ways down the street to further ensure that it is safe to cross.   Always look to your left, then your right, then your left again before crossing any street. In the U.S., this helps you see the immediately oncoming traffic in the lane you will walk into first. In countries where traffic is on the left side of the street, you should look right-left-right. Pay attention to the pedestrian signals, not the traffic lights for vehicles, if both are available. Just because you see a green traffic light does not necessarily mean it is safe for you to cross as a pedestrian.An orange hand symbol, the words DON’T WALK, or another symbol will begin flashing, or a countdown will begin, when your time to cross is running out. Do not cross when you see the static DON’T WALK signal. Make eye contact with drivers at the intersection that you are crossing in front of, to make sure they see you and you see them if they signal at you in any way. This is especially important for crossing a street with stop signs rather than stop lights.  When there are no WALK/DON’T WALK signals for you to cross a street, use extra caution. Stay in the crosswalk and proceed whenever a traffic light turns green or cars at a stop sign see you crossing.   When at a traffic light intersection, wait till the lights turn green for the vehicles going in the same direction as you. Look both ways and pay attention to any drivers that could be turning into your path.When at a stop sign intersection, take special care to make eye contact with the drivers on either side of the street you’re crossing when they are stopped at a stop sign. You may see them “wave you on” or make any other indication that they see you and want you to proceed.  If there is no crosswalk available in a rural area, go to the nearest intersection or most well-lit area and proceed to cross with extra caution when there are no oncoming cars.Ensure that there is no traffic in either direction, or vehicles are very far away, before crossing. Look left and right several times before you make your move to cross, even in a rural or low-traffic area. Note that it is not safe to cross a high-speed or high-traffic street, like the frontage road for a highway, without a crosswalk at an intersection. In this case, you must walk on the sidewalk to an intersection where there are stop signs, stop lights, or crosswalks. Do not attempt to cross without the assistance of road markings and signals.	Cross only at designated crosswalks. Initiate an available pedestrian signal. Cross when the WALK signal comes on. Cross very carefully if there are no pedestrian signals. Find the safest means to cross with no crosswalk.
Bend the collar side downward using the key. Use the key to continue bending the collar backward so that it's tucked firmly against the tab. Repeat for each pop tab.; , Cut in the middle of the pull part of the tab using the cutter tool. Make sure you cut in the same place on every tab, for consistency.  Place the tab inside the staple remover, cut the side first and close the remover down on top of pop tab. Use your finger to push the cut side down. The remover should create a slight bend or bridge looking shape in the pop tab when complete.  This may take a little time. Consider maintaining finished pop tabs in a separate bowl, bag or stacked off to one side.	Prepare the pop tabs. Snip one end of the pop tab. Bend each pop tab using the manual staple remover. Continue this process with each pop tab until you have prepared all of the ones you're using.
Acidic liquids, hot pans, and wet glasses can damage your travertine countertops. The best way to combat damage is to prevent it. Use hot pads, placemats, and coasters on your kitchen countertops. In your bathroom, place all of your beauty and health products on a vanity tray instead of directly on the counter., Travertine is a porous stone that absorbs liquids. When accidents happen, blot up the spill right away. Wiping up the spill will only cause the item to spread, increasing the area susceptible to a permanent stain.   Once a year, seal your countertops. This layer of protection will prevent stains from setting., Sanitize and wipe down your travertine countertops on a regular basis with hot water, gentle cleaners, and a microfiber rag.   Spray the surface with a gentle cleaner that is safe on natural stone. Wipe up the cleaner with a fresh microfiber rag. Polish the surface with a new microfiber cloth.

There are a lot of video editing programs out there, ranging from professional programs with tons of features (Avid, Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro) to free programs that come pre-installed on most computers (iMovie, Windows Movie Maker). While free software is becoming more robust every year, you should think about buying a professional program if you plan on doing more than a few home-movies or simple presentations.   Almost all programs have free trials that allow you to test them out before buying. Currently, Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro are considered "industry standard" programs. You'll need to know them to become a professional video editor. ; , While different programs have different features, the basics of most software are pretty similar. Even simple programs have a lot of tools and buttons, but there are three main parts to every video program that you must know:    The Timeline: This is where you order, edit, and trim your footage into the final video. Sometimes known as a "sequencer" or "storyboard editor" this is where you do the majority of your work. Most programs show both audio and video in the timeline. It is usually near the bottom of your window  The Preview Screen: This is where you watch the draft of your movie while you edit. It usually starts out as a black box with play, rewind, and stop buttons underneath it. It is usually in the upper right quadrant.  The Library/Collection: This is where all of your imported audio, video, and pictures are sorted, allowing you to drag and drop them into your timeline for editing. It usually comes with a search function and some labeling tools. It is usually on the left side of the window. Other sections might include audio controls, a "toolbox," special effects, a place to add titles, and a second video screen to check imported footage.  Though each program has different names for them, there are only a handful of tools that are mandatory for basic editing. Hover over an icon to see what it is named in your program.    Pointer: Usually a standard mouse click icon, the pointer can do everything from trimming footage to moving and deleting clips to adding sound effects.  Razor/Cut: Usually designated by a straight razor icon, this chops the footage in your timeline into two separate clips wherever you click.  Zoom: Allows you to make closer, more accurate cuts to your video by zooming into the timeline  Rolling Edits: Usually two or three separate tools, these make changes to a clip and then move all other clips to make room for your new change. Ex. If you shorten a clip, it automatically lines up the clips following it with the new length.  Before starting any project you should tinker with your software and learn as many tools as you can. Import some old footage and make a quick practice video, then browse the internet for free tutorials or tips.   The internet is a fantastic place to learn how to edit, and there are countless videos and tutorials for even highly specific editing questions. Enroll in a class at a local college or art studio to get detailed instruction if you feel lost.  Whether you are making a simple home-movie or the next blockbuster, well organized footage is crucial to prevent loss, streamline your editing process, and help other team members jump into the project without confusion. Though it may be a hassle at first, thoroughly labeling and filing your video footage will save countless headaches later on.   Organize folders by project and the date it was shot. Ex. My_Movie_Project_3-22-15 Organize clips by scene and take. Ex. My_Movie_Project_Scene1_Take4 Consider advanced organization software like Adobe Bridge if you are working on large scale projects and need complex labeling and meta-data functions. , Depending on your footage several options will appear here, but standard digital video quality will be 720x480 or 1080x720 (High Definition) at 29.97 frames per second. These settings are called NTSC standard and are used primarily in North America. If you are in doubt, ask the cinematographer or director what settings they shot the video on. If you're still lost, look up your camera's settings on the internet -- it should tell you what sort of video you are editing. Many modern programs will automatically conform project settings to your footage, eliminating this headache for less experienced editors.  Though all programs are different, you can usually bring your film clips into the project under File-->Import. This does not make your movie or order your clips, it simply tells the program which videos you will be editing and allows you to access them.   Some programs let you drag and drop footage from another window into your editing window. Importing footage allows for Non-Linear-Editing (NLE): the process of editing video out of order without changing the original footage. All modern editing is Non-Linear.  Start building the skeleton of your movie by ordering your clips and choosing which shots you like the most.   You can always drag clips into new spots after you place them, so feel free to experiment. Start working on a few minutes of the video at a time to prevent becoming overwhelmed.  Once you have the scenes in order you need to trim the beginning and ends so they line up cohesively. While sometimes this is as easy as eliminating the initial "Action!" you'll have to make artistic decisions here too. To splice, find the "razor" or cut tool to break the footage up into smaller parts, then delete the parts you don't like from the timeline.   Many programs let you drag the beginnings and ends of clips to shorten or lengthen them. Never permanently delete any footage-- you never know what will come in handy, even if only for the "blooper reel!"  , Though these are essential to most movies, they can only be effective once you have the footage completely organized and cut. Most programs have dedicated windows and menus for titles and transitions, and you should play around to see which fit your project.   The most common transitions are "fade-ins" and "fade-outs," which is when the image slowly appears or disappears from the screen. For more complicated special effects, transitions, or animations, editors often rely on separate post-production programs like Adobe After Effects.  Not all movies need to take this step, but if you want to look professional you'll need to balance audio and video so that the shots all look alike and there are no jarring volume shifts. Luckily, many programs have an "auto color-correct" function and "volume equalizer" built in.   For a professional looking film you'll need to do this manually, or hire someone who knows how., You may have to repeat this step five, ten, or even fifty times depending on the project, and it will feel tedious. Invite friends, coworkers, or other crew members to watch the project with you and give feedback. Take notes every time you watch it about what you want to fix.   Taking a few days away from the project before watching can help glean new insights.  The best editors spend less time doing the actual edits than thinking creatively about the edit itself. Print out a list of your program's hotkeys and shortcuts and learn to use them effectively.   Make templates for your favorite effects and titles so you can use them instantly. Learn how to use Multi-Cam editing, which allows you to easily cut between multiple cameras shooting the same scene. , Editing is the art of telling a story through cuts, or the juxtaposition of one shot before another. You should experiment with different types of cuts and transitions to find what works for your video. No matter what you use, usually the best cuts are the ones that feel seamless.    Hard Cut-- an immediate cut to another angle, usually in the same scene. This is the most common cut in film.  Smash Cut- An abrupt shift to completely different scene.  Jump Cut-- An abrupt cut made within the same scene, often of a slightly different angle.  J-Cut-- When you hear the audio from the next shot before you see the video.  L-Cut-- When you see the video from the next shot before you hear the audio.  Action Cut-- A cut in the middle of an action, like someone opening a door, that "hides" the cut in the action. , Though extremely technical, editing video is an art form and your paintbrushes are cuts, colors, and sounds. When you make an edit, ask yourself if that choice supports the creative goals of the movie. Discuss the following with the film's director frequently while you work:    Pacing -- how quickly does the scene need to progress? Comedies are often fast so a lot of jokes can be fit in. Thrillers or dramas, however, tend feel slower to build tension.  Perspective-- do you want to highlight one particular character or many? In Scorsese's classic Goodfellas, for example, every shot concerns or includes the narrator Henry Hill, while movies like The Lord of the Rings often cuts to large group scenes.  Themes-- is there a certain style or idea that the director has in mind? Are there certain lines of dialogue, images, or colors that should be prominently shown every chance you have?  , When the viewer is asked to watch the same image or camera angle for a long period of time, it slows down the scene and give us more time to get into the moment. This is helpful when establishing drama or calling attention to a moment's importance.   One recent example is the editing in 12 Years a Slave, where very long takes gave the viewer a feeling for the slow, difficult years the protagonist endured.  Comedy and action in particular benefit from rapid-fire editing and very short shots. Cut between every line of dialogue or each action to give a scene urgency, as viewers feel like they are "along for the ride."   Moving too quickly through edits can feel frantic, but this may work if the scene is high-pressure or nervous, like in scenes from the sci-fi film Snowpiercer.  Just like any other creative endeavor, watching and critiquing other artists is essential to becoming a good editor yourself. Study your favorite scenes, TV shows, and movies with an eye towards shot selection, shot length, and frequency of cuts.   Ask yourself why an editor made the decision they made-- how does it help advance the video? What examples of editing do you like or admire? A good place to start might be recent Oscar winners for Editing or Vimeo's "Best Of" videos. When you see something you like, try to emulate it to learn how it was done.	Choose the right editing software. Learn the basics of your editing interface. Know the essential tools for editing. Play around with your program to learn about other features. Organize your footage. Open your editing software and create a new project. Import your footage. Arrange clips by dragging and dropping them into your timeline. Splice the scenes together.

Streamline your workflow by learning hotkeys and shortcuts. Know how to use different types of cuts. Think about your creative goals while editing. Use longer shots and make less cuts to build tension or highlight key moments. Use shorter shots and frequent cuts to give a scene a quick pace and energy. Study other editors and films.
One of the most well-known and effective ways to get rid of snails is to make beer traps. To make:   Place saucers, bowls or buckets (depending on the size of your problem!) of cheap, flat beer in your garden and leave overnight.       The snails will be attracted to the smell of the beer and climb into the saucer/bucket, where they will become intoxicated by the alcohol, fall in and drown. If you aren't keen on wasting perfectly good beer on your garden snails, you can also make similar traps using grape juice or water mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of yeast and a tablespoon of sugar.; , Copper is used by many gardeners to repel snails and slugs. You can use copper in one of two ways:   You can buy copper tape at a plant nursery and wind it around the perimeter of your vegetable patch or flower bed, or you can simple sprinkle copper pennies around the base of the plants you are trying to protect. Copper repels snails due to a reaction between the metal and the mucous (or slime) produced by the snail as it moves. This sends the snail an unpleasant electro-neural signal, which basically feels like an electric shock., Another effective method many gardeners use to repel snails and slugs is to sprinkle crushed egg shells on the earth surrounding the vulnerable plants.   The egg shells have sharp edges which feel unpleasant under the snails' soft bodies, so they will avoid climbing over them to get to the plants.       This is a particularly green way of repelling snails, as the egg shells contain plenty of calcium which nourishes your soil., Studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have shown that coffee is extremely effective at repelling and killing snails and slugs, It can be used in one of two ways:   You can place cooled coffee in a spray bottle and use it to spritz plants, leaves, soil and even the snails themselves.       Alternatively, you can sprinkle coffee grounds around the base of the plants you wish to protect from snails. This will also help to enrich the soil.  One way to discourage snails is to encourage other garden creatures who snack on snails.   These include toads and frogs, who you can invite into your garden using ceramic toad houses. Turtles, garter snakes and salamanders are also believed to enjoy snails, in addition to most birds (especially robins). Allow ducks and chickens to roam your garden. Ducks and chickens will also eat snails and slugs, and they are actually quite nutritious for them. However, ducks and chickens might trample or eat the plants as well, so be careful with this one!  , Diatomaceous earth is great solution for getting rid of snails. Just be sure to buy the non-toxic, food grade version.   Diatomaceous earth is a type of powdered rock made from the fossils of tiny sea organisms. It has very fine, sharp edges which is harmful to the snails' soft bodies. Diatomaceous earth can be sprinkled on the soil surrounding plants and flower beds. However, it becomes much less effective when wet, so a fresh layer will need to be reapplied after watering your plants or following rainfall., The list of items people use to kill or deter snails goes on and on. Some other popular substances include:   Powdered ginger, talcum powder, ashes from burnt wood or lime. Lint from a clothes dryer can be used to deter snails, in addition to animal hair or fur. Pick them up and move them. Moving snails just 20 feet (6.1 m) away from your garden has shown to be just as effective as termination .	Make beer traps. Try using copper. Sprinkle crushed egg shells. Use coffee. Encourage snail predators. Use diatomaceous earth. Use other deterrents.
Try to avoid driving with too many passengers, especially if you are a new driver. Loud or talkative passengers can be a distraction in and of themselves. So try to drive with only one or two people at a time.For young drivers, the risk of being in a crash triples when they are driving with passengers who are their peers versus driving alone., When you do have someone in the car with you, let them control the music, GPS, and the climate controls. You can also let them answer your texts or phone calls while you are driving. This will not only help you focus on the road, but it will also give your passengers something to do instead of distracting you. Let your passengers know ahead of time what their role is while you drive.For example, “Ok, Kevin, since you are in the passenger’s seat, your main job is to adjust the controls and GPS, as well as answer texts and calls so I can focus on driving.”  , Serious or stressful conversations can get emotional. When your emotions are running high, it is more difficult to focus on the task at hand, in this case driving. Let your passenger know that you would like to talk, but that you would rather do it later when you are not driving. This way you can focus on driving, and give the conversation your full attention when the time is right.You can say for example, “I would like to talk about this with you, but right now is not a good time since I am driving. Let’s wait until we arrive at our destination to talk.” If things start to get heated, then pull the car over in a safe place to diffuse the situation.	Limit the number of passengers. Use your passengers wisely. Save serious conversations for later.
The most effective step you can take to prevent carpet damage is to place all pots onto a dish or saucer. Plant pots are designed to let excess moisture slowly drip out of the drainage hole at the bottom of the pot, which poses a risk to carpet and other surfaces. Allowing this water to collect on a glazed plate or dish and then evaporate into the air will protect your carpet from water damage.; , Filling your pots to the brim with potting mix creates a risk that the excess soil will be spilled over the top when the pot is repositioned or even nudged. Instead, leave about an inch (25 mm) of space between the soil and the rim of large pots.  If you do spill potting mix onto your carpet, you'll want to vacuum it up as soon as possible. The real risk of carpet damage occurs when the soil is ground into the carpet underfoot and allowed to penetrate for a long period. This can lead to staining and water damage.  Any large plants that will be placed directly onto the floor should be grown in stable pots. Wide, shallow pots are less prone to tipping than taller, narrower pots, and so should be preferred when attempting to minimize carpet damage.  If pets and children overturning your houseplants is a concern, then avoid placing pots on tall, slender plant stands. If you support your plants on a stand, use a large, multi-pot stand that is less prone to tipping and spilling soil on your carpet.  If you cannot seem to keep potting soil from getting into your carpet, you can opt for houseplants that can be grown without soil. Air plants can be grown in nothing at all, while plants like lucky bamboo can be grown in water alone. Some cacti and succulents can be grown in gravel alone, which is much easier to remove from carpet than soil.  If a clay pot is overturned, it is very likely to break and spill all of its soil onto your carpet (along with the broken shards of the pot). Using pots made from plastic, bamboo, or other unbreakable materials will help keep carpet damage to a minimum if pots are tipped over.	Keep all houseplant pots in an impermeable saucer. Do not overfill your houseplant pots. Clean up soil spills immediately. Grow your houseplants in sturdy pots. Avoid using slender plant stands to support your houseplants. Grow plants that do not require soil. Use plastic pots rather than ceramic or clay pots.

While preferring a temperate climate, celery also enjoys full sun if possible. However, it will grow well in partial shade as well.  Originally a wetland plant, celery can tolerate relatively moist soil conditions that other vegetables cannot. However, make sure the planting area you choose is not prone to flooding.   You may want to build a raised bed to plant your celery in. Keep in mind that some varieties of celery grow very large harvestable roots, so make sure to build your planter deep enough if you choose to do so. Use cedar wood to build the planter bed if possible, as it does not mold when it gets wet.  Celery varieties prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Though celery does not require impeccable drainage like most vegetables, it does require rich, healthy soil.   Evaluate the soil's calcium and magnesium levels in order to determine what type of limestone to add to your soil. If the soil is low in magnesium, add dolomitic limestone. If it is high in magnesium, add calcitic limestone. Add the limestone two to three months before planting if possible to allow the soil to absorb it. After adding, check the pH again., Mix about four inches of organic fertilizer into your soil. Celery likes extremely rich, organic soil. This will help the seedlings grow into strong, producing plants.	Choose an area with full sun and/or partial shade. Choose an area with rich, moist soil. Test the pH of the soil. Fertilize the soil with manure, compost, or any other high-nitrogen organic fertilizer.
The picture should be well-lit and shouldn't be blurry - you should clearly be able to see the person's face in it. Ensure that the person in the photo and the person in front of you are the same.This seems obvious, but many people using fake IDs hope that the person checking them will be too busy to look closely at the photo.; , One trick of fake IDs is to use another person’s expired ID card or license. Check the card to make sure that it is not expired. Check to see that the type is consistent and hasn’t been tampered with., In many states, driver’s licenses for minors are formatted vertically, while those for people over 21 are horizontal., Microprint is a type style that is so small that it appears as a straight line to the naked eye. It is only visible with a special magnifier. Currently, 48 states use microprint as a security feature., A fake ID is likely to be of poor quality plastic, may show signs of tampering or “splitting,” and is likely to bend or fold more easily than a genuine one., State-issued driver's licenses carry an image that flashes in the light. Fake licenses may attempt to replicate this by printing a dim image in the background with a bright color.	Check for a clear quality photo. Check the printed details. Become familiar with various license formats. Look for microprint. Check the plastic laminate for signs of splitting. Look for the holographic image.
The equalizer should always be between the receiver and the amplifier. Your amplifier will need integrated preamp-out and preamp-in connections to work with this method.  To run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again, you'll need 2 sets of RCA cable (the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and CD players).   The length of the RCA cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer.  Connect one pair of cables to the tape monitor output channels on the receiver and the other end of the cable to the left and right channel inputs on the equalizer.   You will usually find these channels on the rear of the equalizer.  Connect the other pair of cables from the output channels on the back of the equalizer to the tape monitor input channels on the back of the receiver.   Right channel jacks will usually take the red colored RCA plug while left channel should take white or black RCA plugs.  Turn on the receiver and switch the front panel output control to the “Tape Monitor” setting. This opens the tape monitor channels and means that the sound will travel through your equalizer before being sent to the amplifier. Adjust the equalizer knobs according to your preferences.   You should now be able to manipulate the controls on the equalizer to change the frequency response or tone of your music. To switch on the “Tape Monitor” setting you should depress the button on the front panel of the equalizer. If you have a tape deck connected to the tape monitor channels then you will have to remove this before connecting your equalizer.	Hook up your equalizer to your receiver if it does not have preamp-out channels. Purchase 2 pairs of RCA cables. Connect one pair of RCA cables between the receiver and equalizer. Connect the other pair of RCA cables between the receiver and equalizer. Use your equalizer.
Apart from your annual pruning, you should also prune here and there when you see dead or damaged branches or blooms. Especially if it’s an old plant, or if it’s exposed to pests, it will benefit from pruning to remove unhealthy sections.  Even if you’re just doing a few minor clips, still wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Any kind of exposure can cause irritation, so even if you are just clipping a few branches, put on gloves and consider wearing long sleeves in case you brush up against the oleander., Take note of any shoots or stalks that look dead. If it is a young oleander, you may not see any. However, the older and bigger the plant is, the more sections you will see that are past their prime., Use sharp gardening shears to cut off the dead or damaged branches of your oleander. Try to cut them a few inches below where the damaged section begins. If you don’t cut off the entire damaged section, the branch won’t be able to regrow in a healthy way., If the oleander is not only damaged on its branches, but on the whole stalk, cut off the entire stalk. Oleander is an extremely resilient plant, so even cutting off an entire stalk won’t hurt the plant. This stalk will regrow eventually, and will be bushier and healthier than ever!	Check your plant every month or so for dead growths. Put on gloves. Look at your oleander plant up close and from all sides. Snip off damaged branches using sharp gardening shears. Cut entire damaged stalks close to the roots.
See what it does. Playfully hit it. See what it does again. Watch for other behaviors too. Relate these actions to things that might happen to you. (e.g. Someone is bothering you, and you hiss or some one is mad at you, walk away or hiss, etc.); , Tigers favor water more than any other big cat. If you seriously flat out can't swim, it's no big deal. But it's best if you want to really prove you have tiger in you. When swimming, you might want to throw some object in the pool and jump on top of it (which relates to hunting fish).  If someone you dislike comes in your territory, roar or growl at them. If someone you don't know comes in, curiously inspect them. If they seem nice, let them in. If you sense danger,chase them out.  Tigers are strong animals, so you need to keep in shape. Get strong, and exercise a lot so that you will have endurance, speed, and strength.  This is entirely optional. You can wear tiger striped shirts if you want, but you really don't have to. If you know what a furry is, and you want to wear a furry costume, then go ahead, because that's a great choice. There are many furries around. Most people who want to release an inner animal actually are furries! If you can't acquire a costume or tiger-related clothing, just wear some orange-white clothes.  Your friends might think you're crazy, but that's okay. If your clan members or friends think something is wrong with you, then just explain to them what you are doing. If they are a good friend, they will understand. Also,if someone else is being dominant and being leader,roar at them to tell them they are acting like a wolf,not tiger.	Observe your cat.Hiss at it. Swim...a lot. Protect your territory. Stay fit. Wear tiger related clothing. Follow through with your plans.
You want to be good at your instrument! A bad bassist is the kind other band members will hold in contempt, but an excellent bassist is the kind who will impress anyone who hears the band and will receive generous amounts of solo time. (A generous amount of bass solo time is anything above five seconds of a song) Be sure to practice:   as often as possible many different styles various playing techniques (slapping, fingering style, picking, etc.) writing improv, especially short fills or embellishments playing by ear creativity (which goes hand-in-hand with improvisation); , Realize that the bass is not usually a lead instrument and embrace the fact! The greatest bass lines can sometimes be the simplest, depending on the song. If you are upset because the bassline in a cover your band is performing is comprised of long strings of the same note, understand that you are probably playing a punk, emo, or mainstream rock song and the guitarist's long strings of power chords aren't much more exciting to play. When songwriting, don't go to ridiculous lengths to give yourself a technically complicated part. If it fits, great! If not, just make it simpler until it flows with the rest of the band.  That way, you can still be part of the performance in a song that simply doesn't need a bass. An acoustic number, for example.  This is especially important for live playing. If you have as much stage presence as the singer and guitarist, you will be paid at least as much attention as the guitarist. (Give the singer a break, they are the front person!) High-five any fans that hold their hands up to the stage, dance around, be fun to watch! It helps to be noticed if your appearance is radically different from the other members, but don't change your personality! Also be original!  , Listening to other genres can expose you to new styles that will turn your band's music into something unique! (ex. a country band with a bassist who plays with a funk style) Some good bands to listen to are:   Rush Red Hot Chili Peppers Reel Big Fish Led Zeppelin Black Sabbath The Beatles Primus Tool (especially 1996-present) Muse System of a Down Weather Report Deftones Funkadelic/Parliament	Practice!, Know where you fit in the band. Learn to play secondary instruments like keyboards, guitar, or percussion instruments, or simply do backup vocals. Have a personality. Listen to bands with excellent bassists, and not just those that play your style of music.
If you're into bicycling, you should already have one. If you have more than one, use the old one, at least first, in case you ruin it. A helmet with a flattish rear end, not a pointed one, will be easiest to use.; , (A lamp that straps onto the user's head, associated with mining.) It must have a hinged front light mount to direct the beam up and down, with a wide adjustment range.   Preferably the front light will pivot within a low-profile enclosure rather than swinging on an arm, and the kit will have a rear-mounted battery pack with a bright red rear flasher, a high-power white front light, a stretchy coiled wire connecting the parts, and take relatively high capacity AA batteries. LEDs are a virtual necessity for a long, bright life. An old one with a dirty or bad strap would be perfect, since you won't use that part anyway.  Heavy-duty automotive trim style double-sided tape or epoxy putty are convenient and fill gaps; liquid epoxy is stronger. Get a thick, fast curing variety to not run off of curved surfaces.   Other adhesives may work, but finding one that will bond to but not attack helmet materials such as a mix of plastic and foam can be tricky. Clean all mating surfaces and allow them to dry for a good bond.  Take the light and any other electrical parts, such as a rear light, battery holder, and associated wires, off of the strap. The strap will not be needed for this project.  The main light must be mounted where it does not tilt to one side or the other - many have a narrow beam, so accuracy is critical, must have have an unobstructed path forward, must be able to pivot to shine straight ahead (preferably with some extra downward adjustment available) rather than tilted uselessly up, and must not be at the lower edge of the helmet but instead higher up where it will not knock into your face in an accident.   Placement of the battery pack is flexible if it does not have a rear light, but the rear light, whether or not integrated into the battery holder, must shine straight back. The battery door must be openable when the holder is fixed in position. When test-positioning components and checking illumination angles, tilt the helmet to face straight forward as it would be in use, rather than tilting down as it would sit on a table. If the headlamp has separate front and rear components connected by a cable, the position of the front light forward to back along the crown may be chosen to take up excess slack in the cable. (The cable should not be kept in tension to avoid stress to it, to avoid stress to the components, to avoid stress to flexible adhesive such as tape that it may pull loose and crooked, and because tolerances help ensure successful construction.)  , Noting the constraint of placement of the rear battery pack or light, if any, affix the front light to the helmet as you had determined to be appropriate. It must face straight ahead, so check its path in a dimly lit room and tweak its direction as the adhesive hardens (or before you firmly stick down double-sided tape). Allow adhesive to cure fully before proceeding so it stays aligned.  If the helmet does not have a suitable mounting surface, a gentle curve can be built up with double sided tape, epoxy putty, or epoxy.   If it has aerodynamic-looking tail ends of spikes at the back protruding well beyond its overall thickness, you might carefully trim these in a relatively sheltered area (not the rear extremity of the overall helmet) to create a small flat mounting area while not harming the overall structure. Epoxy is very strong and headlamp components are very light: a large mounting area is not needed.  Choose power and blink settings. Blinking lights front and back are great for being seen even when you have enough light to see. , Enjoy your ride!	Choose a bike helmet to modify. Pick out a headlamp for adaptation to the helmet. Select a suitable adhesive to stick them together. Remove the headlamp strap. Test-position the components. Mount the front light. Mount the rear light. Turn on the front and rear lights. Put on the helmet.  , Adjust the front light up or down to suit your preference.
A great solo fits into the fabric of the song. Luckily, most blues songs fit directly into a familiar chord progression, the 12-bar blues. Furthermore, the blues scale (a variation on the "minor pentatonic scale") is one of the easiest and most versatile forms in guitar, but you need to know it forwards and backwards before beginning a more complex style.          Review the 12-bar blues. Review the minor pentatonic scale.; , Within the minor pentatonic scale, not matter where you are on the fretboard, there is one note you can add in two places, known as a "flat fifth," "blues note," or even "devil's note" to get a blues scale. They occur one fret after the 3rd note in your scale, and one fret after the 8th note in your scale. Seen, for example, in the A-minor scale, they are the bolded notes:          e|----------------------5-8-------------| B|------------------5-8-----------------| G|--------------5-7-8------------------| D|----------5-7-------------------------| A|-----5-6-7---------------------------| E|-5-8----------------------------------|, The root note is the key of the song and the first note of the scale. If you started on the 6th string, 5th fret (an A), you'd be playing the A-minor blues scale, in the key of A. This also means that the song, and backing chords, return often to A, meaning you need to be able to find the A anywhere in the scale to sync back with the backing chords.          e|---------------------5-8-------------| B|-----------------5-8-----------------| G|-------------5-7---------------------| D|---------5-7-------------------------| A|-----5-7-----------------------------| E|-5-8---------------------------------|, Remembering back to the 12-bar progression, the blues move in a simple, easy structure that repeats every twelve bars. Good note selection mimics this progression, using licks that originate from the IV chord while the IV chord is being played, for example. In an A-minor blues, the IV chord is a D, and the V chord is an E. The best part is, once you know where the IV and V notes are in the pentatonic, they will be in the same place no matter what key you're playing in. For A-minor, they can be found:          Note: The IV chord is italicized, the V chord is bolded. e|---------------------5-8-------------| B|-----------------5-8-----------------| G|-------------5-7---------------------| D|---------5-7-------------------------| A|-----5-7-----------------------------| E|-5-8---------------------------------|, While this article mostly focuses on the basics of navigating the blues scale, adventurous players should dive off the deep end once they feel comfortable. You know your three "root" notes -- so go find them further down the fret board. Look for patterns and expand your playing to the deeper and higher notes for more melodic variety.	Review the pentatonic scale and the 12-bar blues to inform your soloing. Add the "blue notes" into the minor pentatonic to transform it into the blues scale. Find the all of the root notes within your blues scale. Know where the IV and V chord land on your scale. Find the I, IV, and V chords elsewhere on the neck to take your playing to the next level.
It might be a place you've been or want to visit, a passion of yours, a person or animal, an object, an imaginary world, or anything else you want.; , Surf the net and dig through magazines and books for inspiration. Want to be drawing a book about an imaginary world? Than get pictures of unicorns and descriptions of how ogres live! You should get all the pictures, quotations, drawings, idea's and stories you can about your subject!  , Study the figurine so you can see the proportions and details. Looking at the map can help you design your own and maybe give you some ideas for names.  This step is optional, but it may help you. You can write down what page will contain what, what style it'll be drawn in (cartoon,realistic,sketched,etc) and any other notes you want.  Pick whatever size or style you want. If you can, get one that is decorated with the same thing as your book subject. It should be sturdy and have quality paper so it won't get damaged. Another great thing to get would be a blank book. If it's cover isn't glossed, you can draw on it!  ,, Set aside time each day to draw your book. You might decide to do one page a day or an hour a week.  Photocopy all of the pages in your sketchbook (and number them too!). Contact a publishing agency looking for picture/art/etc books. If they want to see your book, then you can mail it. Be sure too mail the photocopy and not your original artwork,though. You should either laminate the manuscript that you're sending or put it in a binder.	Pick the subject that you want the book to be about. Get inspiration. Get some maps and figurines to make drawing easier. Write down what you want to draw and write. Get a sketchbook. Collect all the pencils,crayons and markers you can find!  , Start drawing!, If you don't want to publish your book, then skip this step.
Making a movie by yourself means you'll have to strip away any other actors or any scenes that need multiple people to run. This eliminates most special effects and dialog, unfortunately. But these limitations can be liberating, leading to unique and creative workarounds. Some ideas to consider filming are:    Art Films: Pioneers like Sadie Benning and Bruce Nauman have made huge contributions to the art world with nothing by a camera and a willingness to experiment. You can do anything from video diaries to abstract videos exploring color or sound. Check out the free Video Data Bank for inspiration.  Short Documentaries: All you need is a camera and a microphone and you can be on the street interviewing and grabbing footage.  Talking Heads: Popular on YouTube and in shows like The Office, this is just you talking to your camera, delivering a monologue or performing a sketch. Sometimes this video is set next to a movie or game you are commenting on.  Stop-motion: Though time consuming, stop-motion is one of the few places a filmmaker can make a professional-looking film all by themselves.; , It doesn't need to cover the entire story if you are working with a loose idea, but having some ideas of paper will guide you when filming starts. Almost all videos tell a story, in some way shape or form, and almost all stories are broken into three parts:    The Beginning: Set up the world of your video. It can be you, the character, the location you're shooting on, or simply a color or mood you want to explore.  The Conflict: Something disturbs, changes, or morphs the original set-up. For art films or smaller pieces, this might just be a change of pace or the introduction of a new theme. The "story" is told through this change.  The Resolution: How does your story end, what is your message or thought? Some stories just end, but this just implies that nothing has changed in the end., All you need is a camera and a way to edit the footage on a computer, but there is additional equipment that will help build a movie by yourself as well:    A Tripod: If you want to film yourself in a scene, a tripod is the best way to get a steady camera that can be moved, spun, and raised/lowered into a variety of angles.  Lighting: One of the key differences between amateur-looking movies and professional ones is good lighting. Even 3-4 clamp lights bought at Home Depot can be enough to get strong, consistent lighting in your movie.  If you're making a movie on your own you want as many tricks up your sleeve as possible. Your camera is your best friend, and knowing how to manipulate it will be a big part of making your movie unique and original. The best way to learn is to play, but some things you need to look out for include:    White Balance: This changes the "temperature" of your film, or the coloring. A properly set white balance ensures that all of your colors look natural. While you can play with white balance to get different visual effects, this is often easier while editing.  Lenses: Different lenses will profoundly change your shot composition. Play with wide angles, fish eyes, and macro lenses to change up your visuals.  Focus: Focusing takes a lifetime to master, and you should start now. Focus dictates what part of the shot is clear and which is blurry. Many cameras have automatic focus, but to make great films you need to manually control the focus.	Come up with a simple, filmable idea. Write out a basic script. Round up your equipment. Experiment with your camera until you know every feature.
Border your ceilings with pieces of bamboo, and lay a couple of bamboo throw rugs on the floor. Use bamboo to accent lights, wardrobes, and chairs for an added tropical effect., This will give the room a more tropical feel, as many tropical rooms and resorts use canopies both as mosquito netting and as protection from the hot sun. Canopies also allow for a romantic and playful atmosphere., In order to make a room seem more spacious, group mirrors together. Mirrors reflect light instead of absorbing it, so hanging them strategically, such as on their side, can trick the eye into making walls appear longer., Place seashells on dresser surfaces and on your bedside table. When you go to the beach, find shells that catch your eye and display them in your room to bring the seashore home. This way, people will instantly think of paradise upon seeing your space.  Gather tropical plants, place them in flower pots, and scatter them throughout your room. Not only do plants provoke thoughts of paradise, but they will also help your health. Plants ease breathing and increase the humidity in the room, which can help fend off colds, sore throats, and dry skin.	Accessorize with bamboo. Hang a net-like canopy over your bed. Use mirrors. Decorate with seashells. Use plants as decor.
If it's a door, you're inevitably going to be in someone's way and irritate someone. Move to the side if possible; if there's no space, try to accommodate for others and move slightly to the side in the little space you have.  Too many people on one train can cause injury and crashes. If it's possible, try to catch a later train. It'll be a relief for people who are already stuffed in a crowded train like a sardine in a tin.  It wastes space, especially when people are going to board the train with luggage and etc.  If available, go into areas designated for prams/buggies/strollers, etc. or into the wheelchair area (as long as there are no people utilizing that area).	Be conscious of what you're standing in front of. If the train cannot fit anymore people on; don't try to get on. Do not stand when there are seats available. If you've got a buggy, try to keep out of aisles.
Install the NOOK software to your PC or Mac computer.

Don’t feel intimidated by the reality of creating a demo. It’s possible to create demos in DIY sound booths if you have the right padding to line your walls, the right mic, and the right audio equipment.   Another option for creating your demo is to pay for studio time. Some places offer low rates like $35 an hour to use their equipment. Consider that when looking for a place to record. Sell your finished demo at your shows for profit, place them online on places like Soundcloud and YouTube for exposure, and/or distribute them to labels., Nowadays, sending tracks to labels is as simple as finding the right email and sending over audio files. Send your promo package in a professional way by giving the audio file a sensible name, branding it with your band’s logo, and any additional marketing materials that your band may have.Make sure that the track is easily shareable in the event that a producer or exec likes it and wants to share it. When you’re sending a demo to labels, make sure that the CD or package you include has 2-3 of your band’s best songs on it.Amongst your marketing materials, there should also be a press release enclosed. Including a press release with the promo package you send to renowned music sites will help them publish a write up about your band more efficiently.  A manager can rep your band and make the phone calls and reach out to people if necessary. It might be possible to obtain a manager who won’t require a payday until they bring you results.	Invest money into creating and producing a demo for your band. Send out promo packages to labels. Start shopping around for a manager.
If the average rainfall during the summer is less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week, you will need to give the soil a good, thorough drenching once a week. Do so early in the morning or in the evening since watering plants in the middle of a hot afternoon can actually cause them to burn when sunlight reflects off the water.  Use a thin layer, just enough to give the soil a little added boost of nutrition.  The first feeding should be in the early spring, around the same time that you apply compost. The second should be about two months later.   Alternatively, you can skip the first feeding if you use compost and simply apply one coating several months later, after the initial benefits of the compost have worn off.  After applying compost and/or an early spring dose of fertilizer, lay 2 inches (5 cm) of wood chips or another mulch over the flower bed and around the stems of the flower. This mulch helps the soil to retain moisture and also prevents weeds from popping up.  Coreopsis flowers have thick, sturdy stems, and flowers of a moderate height will not need to be staked. If you have larger varieties and the heads begin to droop mid-season, insert a metal or wood pole into the ground about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from the flower and 4 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) deep. Carefully tie the step to the pole using twine or thick yarn.  When the petals of the flower start to wither and drop, use clean shears to snip off the head of the flower. Doing so redirects the plant's energy and encourages it to sprout additional blooms before the end of the season.  After the first major frost comes, you should trim the stem of the plant back, only leaving about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of stem above the soil line.  Do so in the early spring, when growth is just beginning to develop, or in the mid to late fall, right before the frost comes. Carefully dig the plant up by lifting it out with a shovel. Divide the plant into clumps. Large clumps can be replanted immediately, but smaller clumps may need to be potted and kept indoors until the weaker roots develop more. Weaker clumps that are removed can usually be replanted during the late spring or early summer., Aphids are the most common insect to appear, and leaf spot, rust, and wilt are the most common diseases. If these problems occur, you can treat the plant with an insecticide or fungicide. Only use pesticides as necessary, though. Do not apply preventative pesticides.	Only water established plants during seasons of drought. Apply compost every spring. Fertilize the flowers once or twice a season.Use an all-purpose, granular, slow-release fertilizer to make the feeding last longer. Lay mulch over the flower bed each spring. Stake the flowers only as necessary. Deadhead the blooms to encourage further blooming. Cut back the stems in late fall to early winter. Divide the plants every two to three years. Watch out for pests and disease.
Take a measuring tape and measure the circumference of your hips, or wherever you desire the thong to rest, to determine the length of the band for your thong. Then, to figure out how long your crotch pieces need to be, take the measuring tape and measure in line with your belly button, slightly below your hips, and pull the tape underneath your crotch, through your legs, and top the top of your hips on your backside.; , Purchase lace trim that is as long as the measurements for the waistband and two times the measurements for the crotch. Depending on the width you desire for your thong, the lace should be about two inches wide. You will also need a piece of cotton fabric for the lining that is about three square inches. Make sure the cotton fabric is similar to the color of lace you choose.  You will divide your lace into four pieces, two for the band of your thong, and two for the crotch of your thong. Taking your hip measurements, divide by two, then cut the lace into two pieces for those measurements. Next, you'll cut your crotch piece by taking your crotch measurements and cutting two equal strips to be the length of the measurements.   For example, if you measured 38 inches for your hips, you'll divide by two and you'll come out with 19 inches for each strip. Then if you measured 10 inches for your crotch piece, you'll just cut two 10 inch pieces of lace.  Before you begin sewing, you'll need to pin your lace together. First, pin your hip pieces together by laying one on top of the other and then place one pin vertically on each end.  Lay your crotch pieces on top of each other, but instead of two vertical pins, you'll create a line of horizontal pins through the middle of the lace. Start at one end of your lace and place pins horizontally going across the fabric. As you start to reach the other end of your lace, begin pointing pins toward the bottom corner of your fabric, creating a down diagonal. , Using a sewing a machine, or a needle and thread if you are courageous, sew both pieces together. For the best stitch, you'll want to use a serger or a zigzag stitch. Taking the waistband, sew both ends together, allowing the stitch to hang over the lace, meaning you shouldn't have any extra fabric sticking out past the stitch. , This piece will be sewn a bit differently as you'll be sewing through the middle of your pieces rather than the end. Follow the pins that you placed through your thong, sewing through the middle and then down the diagonal towards the bottom corner. This will create a wider piece for the front of your thong that meets with the waistband. , Taking your crotch piece, line up the wider side with one side of your waistband, both with the insides facing out and sew along the top of the crotch piece and the bottom of the waistband using a zigzag stitch. Then, do the same with other side of the crotch piece to the other end of your waistband.   You should see a continuous seam, meaning you matched the seam of the crotch piece up with each seam on the waistband.  This isn't necessary, but it is good for hygiene purposes and comfort. Taking your cotton fabric, cut a piece that fits nicely inside the crotch of your thong, and sew along three sides of the fabric, leaving the highest side (the side that will be more in the front of the thong) open.  After you've finished sewing, turn your thong right side out and try it on. Because the lace is stretchy you shouldn't have had to add any extra material. If you decide the bands are too thick or not thick enough, consider buying lace trim that is less than or more than two inches wide.	Measure yourself. Gather your materials. Cut your lace. Pin the waist band together. Pin you crotch pieces together. Sew the waist band together. Sew the crotch piece together. Line the seams up and sew. Add a cotton lining. Admire the finished product.
Ryuk has a rebellious way of dressing. He wears completely black, including several chains and studs. If you want to dress like him modestly, you could incorporate black, grey, navy, dark purple, and other dark colors into your wardrobe. He also wears black boots, which you could wear too. If you don't want to wear boots, especially in hotter weather, try wearing combat boots, flats, flip flops, or even black Converse or Vans, if you wanted. Footwear isn't crucial as long as it's in Ryuk's color scheme.   Wear a lot of black. Find a way to make it look as if your shirt is sewn into your skin.; , You could wear multiple belts, like Ryuk. Wear dark colored skinny jeans, patterned leggings, or even leather leggings or pants. Wear black skirts with ripped up black tights or pantyhose underneath.  When dressing like Ryuk, keep in mind that anything that's dark-colored goes.  Ryuk wears a lot of metal, like his earring. Wear some chains and a heart attached to a chain on your left ear.  It pulls the whole thing together.  Make up is key. Since most people aren't born with blue skin, you'll need a lot of blue makeup to get the look you want (that's not even starting with the lips or eyes). It's best if someone helps you with it.  Unless you want to go for his look at the end of the series (in which case, buy some blank contacts), Ryuk's eyes are necessary. They're haunting to someone who stares into them, like a Shinigami should be.  Since you've read or watched Death Note, you probably have noticed that Ryuk doesn't care much about Light Yagami, correct? After all, Ryuk is a Death God and he doesn't care much about humans or their opinion of him or other shinigamis. If you wish to act like Ryuk, it's best if you adopt an "I don't care" attitude. Wear what you want, do whatever you want, and so on and so forth. Ryuk is creepy and doesn't play for any sides.   Ryuk doesn't truly care about Light. While Light digs his own grave, Ryuk sits back and watches. For example, if someone were to spread stupid rumours about you, just laugh it off and carry on. That's what Ryuk would do. He doesn't dwell on dumb stuff that has no effect on him. In addition to your "I don't give a damn" attitude, however do give a damn about friends, family, your grades in school, etc.  Ryuk is very opinionated, sarcastic, and snarky. Keep in mind that some people don't like these qualities in a person. Yet, some do. Try cracking dry humour jokes. If someone is doing something wrong, give them your opinion on how they can do better or try harder. Being opinionated doesn't mean acting like an ass to people. Think of it as a "friendly suggestion.", Last but not least, Ryuk is loyal. True, he isn't fond of humans or of Light, but he remains loyal to him. He wouldn't necessarily risk his life for Light, as Rem, Misa's Shinigami did. For an example, he told Light that Raye Pen-bar was following him. He also was willing to help Light Yagami find out Raye's ' real name when Ryuk followed through Light's plan during the bus jacking.   Follow around a guy who acts like Light. Talk to him and tell him how to work the Death Note. , Like the other characters of Death Note, Ryuk has strange habits. For one, Ryuk is addicted to apples. He complains the apples in the Shinigami Realm are dry and disgusting. If you want to establish your addiction to apples, always be snacking on an apple or apple slices.   Ryuk's second "habit" is he goes through withdrawal if he doesn't eat an apple. Become irritable and loopy if you don't eat one for sometime. But don't make yourself or others miserable around you, and don't make yourself look like an idiot. Be slightly loopy and irritable, yet enough so others will comprehend that it's apples that cause you to become that way. Eat apples all the time. Say, "It's worth going to the human world for these apples." or something along the lines. Pretend to go through withdrawal symptoms if you can't eat apples.	Dress with flair. Wear such clothes as band shirts, plain dark-colored clothes, leather, suede, studs, crosses and spikes Think of drab, dark colors. Wear metal. Carry around a Death Note wherever you go. Use makeup for your skin. Buy yellow contacts with red irises. Act as if you don't care. Have opinions. Be loyal. Laugh evilly when something amuses you.  , Have a love for apples.
On Line 14, put your name and address. On Line 14a, put the name and address of the person who is registering the car for you. Note that this is where the registration renewal forms will get sent, so make sure the person is willing and able to take that action down the line. On Line 14b, put the address where the car will be stored or parked. This is likely to be the address of the person registering the car for you.; , The letter should contain the date, your name, your address, your phone number, your signature. You can write this in the body of the letter:   "I, , the sole owner of the vehicle with VIN # ((residing at ) complete authorization to operate and register my vehicle in the state of Texas. I am including a copy of the title along with a copy of my driver's license for your reference.

Choose and buy a suitable monofin, and then create a “sleeve” of neoprene. The latex must have something to adhere to. Break out the sewing machine and make a fabric tail for yourself. Don’t mistake Neoprene for Neoprin. They are different materials. Neoprin will stretch out eventually and your tail will no longer fit.   , There are many ways to do this step, and it is up to you which method you want to use. You can make scales out of foam that you punch circles out of. It is best to use the adhesive foam that you use to make art projects with. Used a filed pipe and a hammer to punch out a lot of the scale shapes then lay them in the shape of your scale mold. The other method would be one sculpt out the scales, using clay and a cookie cutter or foil folded into the shape you want.  The scale sheet should be completed in a box that you can then pour white hydro cal into. Be sure to build “walls” around the scales. You can see from the example above that we use 2x4 planks and then fill in the edges with clay.  You're only sculpting half of this tail before making two pulls of it. Pulls are what you “pull” out of the mold. Don’t make it too thick, since Latex takes forever to dry, and won’t hold up well with a thick mold.   Note: Sculpt the fluke very close to the monofins size.  Use a brush to paint the Latex into the mold. The unfortunate thing about liquid latex is that it has to air dry. This means that if you paint it too thick, it will never cure. To get a color base on the liquid Latex, add acrylic into it. This makes it so that when your tail gets scratched, there won’t be a giant white mark on it. You’re going to have to paint over the tail anyways, but this will ensure that you have something to base the color on.	Buy a monofin or swimming feet. Make the mold for the scales. Complete the mold. Make the tail or fluke. Complete the Tail/Fluke.
It’s important to use very fresh roses if you are harvesting petals. If you are harvesting your own roses, make sure the bush is hydrated before you cut the flowers. To do this, water the plant the night before you cut the flowers.; , Use a sharp knife to cut the stem. A clean cut means the stem will absorb water better than if you inflict a crushing cut from a blunt tool.   Try to make a diagonal (slanting) cut rather than a straight, square one. Doing this increases the area of cell tissue exposed to water so that the stem can drink more.  It’s important the rose petals are dry when you store them. If this is unavoidable, lay the petals out on a clean dry towel after harvesting and gently pat them dry.  Place your cut flowers in cool water in a clean container such as a vase until you are ready to use them. It’s a good idea to keep the vase in as cool a position as possible. A cool cellar or garage works well; at the very least store the vase away from direct sunlight and drafts.   You should avoid placing the vase near electrical appliances such as TVs as these emit heat. Try to change the water every other day.  Try to use a young, slightly closed rose bloom for taking petals rather than a fully open one or any bloom that is starting to drop petals voluntarily. However, don’t use buds that are too young and tightly closed. The bloom should be just about to open.	Pick petals from fresh roses. Make sure you cut young flowers in the early morning before the day heats up. Avoid harvesting roses just after it has rained as the petals will be moist. Keep your cut flowers cool until you are ready to pluck the petals. Pluck petals from closed blooms.
Before attempting to bend the steel bar, you need to wrap it in material to make it easier to grip and bend, as well as to protect your hands as you bend it. Suitable wrapping materials include the following:  Leather. Leather is the toughest material you can use to wrap the steel with and is the best material for adding leverage to your grip.       Cordura. Cordura, a synthetic canvas-like fabric, is used in professionally created bending wraps. It's as puncture resistant and durable as leather, but not as good in adding leverage to your grip. Cordura is initially stiff, but becomes more supple over time as it absorbs the oils from your skin.       Heavy cloth. A heavy cloth, such as a shop cloth or rag, is the cheapest suitable wrapping material, and has been traditionally used for nail bending feats. However, it is nowhere near as durable or puncture-proof as either leather or Cordura.  If you're using leather, cut strips twelve inches (30 cm) long by four inches (10 cm) wide. If you're using either Cordura or heavy cloth, fold the material into strips of these dimensions.  The chalk will keep the wrap from slipping once it's wrapped around the steel.  Wrap the strips around the bar as tightly as possible to keep them from slipping; you may wish to use a rubber band to keep the wrapping tight. Leaving a gap between the strips prevents one strip from bumping into the other as you bend the steel and preventing you from completing the bend.	Choose a suitable wrapping material. Fold or cut the wrapping material into strips. Coat the strips with chalk. Wrap each end of the bar with a strip, leaving a gap between the strips.
Your sinus cavities make your voice sound significantly different in your head than it sounds to other people. This means that, if you want to hear yourself how others do, you must record it back to yourself.This is the easiest, most private, and fastest way to find out if you can sing naturally.   You don't have to use fancy microphones or recording technology to find out if you've got a good set of pipes. Most computers and smart phones have built-in microphones and voice recording software. Alternatively, you can go analog and use a basic cassette voice recorder or go really old school and record your voice onto someone else's answering message. If you're nervous showing off your singing in front of others, this is a great way to get around the performance anxiety. Nobody needs to hear your recording but you; you can sing your heart out without fear of judgement.; , Despite what the auditions on American Idol and other talent shows would have you believe, singing a cappella (without accompaniment) isn't the best way to figure out whether or not you've got a good singing voice. It's important to give yourself a guide track, like a blank karaoke track, to find out whether or not you can match tones and stay in tune while you're singing. Blank karaoke tracks are readily available online, specifically on YouTube.   You can find simple, free, online MIDI versions of pop songs and old standards that you might like to sing. They might not sound like hits, but they'll give you a tune to work with. Also check out the pre-programmed tracks on Casio keyboards, or the instrumental version of songs from albums you might have.  Once you've chosen your song and your recorder, find a nice quiet place to try out your singing. This way you won't have to worry about whether or not anyone will be hearing your voice and judging you. Cue up your track and hit record.   If you've got a basement, or a garage, sneak out and settle in, or wait until you'll get some alone time. You could also just sit in the car for a while and record yourself there. Remember, you're not trying to record a hit to put on the radio. You're just trying to evaluate how good your singing voice is. Don't worry about getting it all right, or the quality of the recording.  Good singing isn't about doing those vocal acrobatics that Mariah Carey does. If you can't do that, don't worry. It's much better to be able to sing simply and carry a song in tune. Forget about warbling your voice with vibrato and flying all over the place. Just sing the song in its simplest form, or just how you sing it comfortably.  This is your moment of truth! After you've got your recording, take a deep breath and press play. Listen to how well you move through the chord changes in the song, whether you're able to follow the tune and hit all the notes the song requires.   Listen to the track in a variety of ways. Check it out on your cheap computer speakers, then plug the track in and listen to your car speakers, then check it out on headphones. Some things don't sound good on cheap, tiny speakers, but sound better coming through high quality headphones. Listen closely and listen a few times.  Voices aren't all alike, and we can't all sing songs in the same range. That's why choirs are made up from different kinds of voices, and songs are written for different vocal ranges. If your recording doesn't sound great, that might be because you chose a song you like instead of one that is in your range.   Download a cheap tuning app that analyzes your voice and sing in your normal vocal range. When you sing alone, what feels most comfortable? Sing that. Check out where it registers on the vocal tuner. Then try singing your lowest note and your highest note and note those on paper. Figure out how many notes are between your low and your high and you'll have some idea of your range. Pick a song that fits that range.  Tone deafness is a real thing. Some people aren't able to hear a tone and simultaneously match their voice to that tone which is, of course, a skill required for accurate singing. In addition to recording your voice and listening to the playback, take a quick, free, online tone-deafness test.  You've given yourself your best shot at finding out whether you can sing: you picked a song within your range, learned out to sing it using the right technique, and practiced until you had it memorized. Now it's time to put your voice to the test in front of your family.   Pick a room that will help you present your voice at its best. A large room with high ceilings will make your voice sound better than a carpeted basement with low ceilings will. If you get nervous or embarrassed, stop singing and start over. You aren't in Carnegie Hall; this is about your voice, not your stage fright issues. Those can be addressed later. When your performance is finished, ask your family to give you an honest opinion. No matter what they say, you should probably take it with a grain of salt; they may try to save your feelings or give you a good ribbing, as families sometimes do. However, their reaction should give you an inkling about whether your voice is good. If you feel confident enough to keep going, it's time to take it to the next level.  There are many opportunities to perform in public: you can go to an open mic night at a club or lounge, sign up for a talent show, or do karaoke. Find a venue that works for you and prepare to sing a song for strangers.   As you sing, watch the crowd's reaction. They aren't as invested as your family in making sure you walk away with your self-esteem intact, so you may be able to get a better sense of whether your voice is easy on the ears. Have a friend in the crowd ask some strangers whether they thought you were a good singer. Random strangers don't always appreciate being polled, so you shouldn't place your singing future in their hands; just collect opinions and continue taking steps to determine whether you have a good singing voice.  Another way to get feedback from the public is by busking in a train station or in a busy shopping area. If you can, set up a microphone and a small amplifier so that people will be attracted to your singing. You can sing for free or set out a hat or bowl in front of your setup to make a little cash while you conduct this personal experiment.   Choose a popular, seasonal song to draw more people in. If people seem to avoid the area instead of drawing closer, your voice may not sound appealing. This could simply be a result of bad amplification, so don't let it completely dishearten you. Don't base your conclusion on how much money you make or how many people gather around. Commuters and busy shoppers don't always take the time to stop and acknowledge buskers, but that doesn't mean they didn't like the sound of your voice.  If you have a wonderful singing voice, you will know it by now. If not, you'll likely also know it. But, just as a guitar player has to go through an awkward period of fumbling over the strings, singers have to work hard at singing to improve their voices. It's not something that you're born with. It's something you can work on with dedication and practice.   If someone tells you that you can't sing, but you've got a passion to work on your voice, then continue practicing and working hard to get your voice improved. Don't listen to the noise. Even so, some people can just never sing no matter how hard they practice. You should already know if this is you.  Paying someone to teach you how to use your voice as an instrument can make a big difference in how well you sing. Choose an instructor you can trust to give you honest feedback about your ability.  If you've concluded that you don't have natural singing ability, but you love to sing, keep working at it. Your instructor will be able to help you make the most of the vocal chords you were born with. The joy of singing is available to everyone who wants it, not just people who are naturally gifted.  Singing as part of a choir is an excellent way to determine whether you have a good singing voice. You'll get feedback from the choir director and the other members of the choir, and you may get the chance to hear your voice as part of a professional recording.   Jump at the chance to sing a solo. You'll get more one-on-one instruction from the choir director, and when you perform you'll get more feedback than you would as part of the group. Talk with the choir director about ways to increase your singing ability. You could also ask the director point blank if he or she thinks you have singing talent.	Record your voice. Choose a back-up track. Sing in private. Sing naturally. Listen to the playback. Find a song in your range if you don't like what you hear. Take a tone deaf test. Perform for your family. Perform in public. Try busking. Learn to take constructive criticism. Take voice lessons. Stick with it. Try joining a community choir.
As cars get older, lots of dirty deposits build up along the fuel lines making it harder for fuel to get to the engine. Adding a fuel cleaning additive to your car (as stated in the instructions on the bottle) will help clean these deposits out.; , It will take a little bit of time for the fuel cleaning additive to mix with the fuel and to reach the engine.   If the car runs worse than before, change the fuel filter. This is because the deposits that the cleaner has removed from the fuel tank has clogged up the fuel filter.	Add a fuel cleaning additive to your fuel. Drive the car for a week in order to make sure the fuel additive has had time to clean all these deposits.
You can do this simply by yawning.Try to keep that feeling of yawning in your mouth and throat while you sing. Can you mimic that feeling without even yawning, too?   Singing well (and singing with vibrato) is largely about being relaxed and open. If your throat is closed, the noise won't flow and your tone won't be warm and rich. You may be able to belt a few notes, but your full range will be cut off.; , If you are not relaxed, you will not be able to sing with vibrato. It should come naturally if you relax and don't strain your voice. Shake out any tension from your wrists to your ankles. Do circles with your neck, stretching out the sides. Get loose on the outside so you can avoid tension on the inside.   This includes all the muscles in your face and head, too, like your jaw and tongue. They should be doing very little work, regardless of whether you're singing with a straight tone or with vibrato.  In order to master breath flow (which is alarmingly important), keep good posture by standing with one foot slightly in front of the other, and your neck, head, and back all in a straight line. Subglottic pressure is actually regulated by your abs, lower back, chest, and butt muscles.If you're sitting, sit on the edge of your chair with your back straight and your head facing directly forward – you shouldn't be looking down, even if you're reading music.  Take a good, solid, deep breath into your core. Your shoulders should not go up and your diaphragm should lower. When you sing the note, concentrate on it naturally cycling in front of you. Let it go on its own – it should do it for you.   Proper singing isn't work. If you're feeling like you're forcing out a specific sound, you're not doing it right. Vibrato is natural; don't bother forcing it if it's not there. It just means you need to concentrate on other aspects of singing first. Vibrato is the icing on the cake, not the flour in the batter. It comes last.  Not breathing or breathing inconsistently is surprisingly easy to do while singing. To produce the sound you're aiming for, keep the amount of air you produce steady and even. If it's not steady, your vibrato will wobble all over the place.   In addition to being steady, your breath needs to be even to keep vibrato consistent. If it's not even, you may notice your vibrato slowing down or speeding up – both of which should be avoided.  You've probably heard a few singers whose vibrato is so strong it takes over the song. It just won't stop, and it's a little distracting. Don't be this singer. Vibrato sounds much better when it's light and natural. It should be like surprise ice cream, not ice cream splattered all over you and splattered everywhere.   What's more, know when it's appropriate – which isn't all the time. If you sang a song entirely in a straight tone, that song wouldn't be aurally interesting. If you sang it entirely with vibrato, that song wouldn't be aurally interesting either. So use it sometimes, don't use it others, and switch it up. Use it when you feel like it fits.  If vibrato doesn't come naturally to you, well, for starters, don't give yourself a hard time. Many pros fake it or do it incorrectly (more on this in a bit). Vibrato is trendy more than anything. That being said, continue to work on your singing and it'll come. When you have solid technique, vibrato will be a piece of cake.   Focus on your resonance and timbre, instead. You'll develop the right habits of singing freely, breathing properly, and being relaxed. You'll start placing the sounds correctly in your mouth, letting go of your jaw and tongue, and the vibrato will start spilling out.  Some vocal teachers will help you concentrate on developing your "vibrato" by teaching you a few exercises that force it out. This isn't true vibrato – this is you imitating vibrato. If you're singing correctly, vibrato will develop – it's a natural physical result of singing correctly.   This is very much so an aspect of singing that comes with time. There's no magical way to develop it overnight. It takes a rich, healthy tone and proper breath support for it to even start – and you can't run before you walk.  Technically speaking, vibrato is an even, steady tonal oscillation of a pitch's center. It's a slight variation in pitch and is the natural function of a well-produced tone.It cannot be naturally manipulated.   Most people believe that vibrato adds a warmth and depth to the voice. It's perceived by the ears as a pitch variant, but in actually it's part of the tone, centering it.  Sure, vibrato sounds good, but it's also helpful for the voice. Not only does it center the pitch, but it also helps the muscles relax. It's your larynx pulsing in order to properly deal with the pressure that's being put upon it.It's there to protect your vocal folds from over-exertion.   Think about lifting weights. When your muscles are under duress, they automatically start shaking. Have you ever thought about why? It's a similar mechanism throughout your entire body.  So many people "fake their vibrato," which is to say that they don't actually have a true vibrato at all. Let's discuss "trillo, "wobble", and "tremolo":Trillo. This sounds like a goat bleating, point blank. It sort of sounds like a very fast, staccato vibrato. It is caused by breath that has not properly placed and becomes dispersed.  Wobble. This is when the cycles occur slowly and far apart. There's usually a larger variation in pitch, too. It generally happens from a lack of focus in tone or poor breath management.  Tremolo. Juxtaposing the wobble (which is too slow), the tremolo is too fast. It comes about from too much glottal pressure, resulting in tension around the base of the tongue.  Place your hands at the bottom of your chest and feel where your ribs come together in the middle. Now move your hands slightly below this point (it's the soft area a few centimeters above your belly button). Now sing a note on one pitch in your easy range – any note will do. As you're singing this note, push in gently with your hands. The key is to push in, then pull out, and push in, then pull out and so on. Try doing this at a rate of around 3 to 4 cycles a second.   For the record, this type of exercise generally produces a tremolo sound. The volume changes while pitch remains the same, which is not true vibrato. However, it can give you a good idea of what muscles are involved and start retraining your muscles.  Some teachers instruct their students to hold a finger on their larynx and wiggle it up and down while singing on a sustained pitch. This will result in a strange sound similar to a vibrato, but again, not true vibrato. That being said, it can help get new muscles working in new ways.   Take these exercises with a grain of salt. As stated many times previously in this article, true, natural vibrato comes on its own. These are simply to get you and your voice thinking in different ways.  Another method teachers employ is to have their students switch between two notes at quicker and quicker rates until it's reminiscent of vibrato. The aim is for 6-8 cycles per second.   As you can likely tell, this isn't vibrato either. It's a mimicking technique that gets close to the sound. Just make sure the two notes you're switching between are a semitone or less away from each other.  You know those singers whose jaws move up and down with every hint of a vibrato cycle? This isn't how you're supposed to do it, whether you're Whitney Houston or not. Your jaw should be completely relaxed during singing, along with every other part of your body. So, yes, moving your jaw up and down can mimic that sound, but it's not natural or healthy.   This is often called "Gospel Jaw" because it's seen so prominently with Gospel singers. It's also called "jaw vibrato" as it's not emanating from your vocal folds – it's just vibrato produced with your jaw.	Open the back of your throat. Relax your muscles completely. To help you breathe correctly, stand correctly. Sing with your diaphragm. Keep your breath flow steady and even. Keep it subtle. Master other things first if need be. Know that your vibrato will develop naturally in time if you sing correctly. Understand what vibrato is. Know why it's helpful. Know that vibrato is not the same as "trillo," "wobble," or "tremolo.", Try a diaphragm exercise. Consider placing a finger on your larynx. Switch between two notes, one note and another a semitone away. Don't give yourself "Gospel Jaw."
; , How high may depend on your teacher's preference.  Press your palms together as though you are praying, then, slowly, raise your hands above your head (still with the palms pressed together). Slowly rotate your palms outward then lower your arms. Your shoulders should now be sufficiently back. Do NOT do that on stage.  Your thumb should be on the inside of your fists. Place your thumb against your palm and cover your thumb with the rest of your fingers.  If you've seen Irish dance, then you probably know that a good Irish dancer will hold her arms close to her side, and she will keep them straight. You should do the same. Straighten your arms and tuck them just behind you. They should always stay against your body and, ideally, you should look armless if viewed from the front.  It will look very strange if your wrists are turned out, behind you. , The middle of your right foot should be touching your left toes  , When you are about to begin dancing, bring your right foot straight out to "point" Your right foot should be directly out from your left knee  , To point, curl your toes downward and point your entire foot. Straighten your legs so that you have a smooth line from your hip, to your knee, down to your toes.  Only your big toe should touch the floor. You can achieve this by turning the inside of your right ankle out (to the left).	Stand in a neutral position, arms at your sides, heels together, toes apart. Hold your head to should show that you are proud, but your chin should only be so high. Roll your shoulders back. Clench your hands, then relax them slightly. Pull your arms in. Check to be sure the inside of your wrists are turned in, towards your body.Turn your feet out (toes pointing to either left or right, heels pointing inward)  , Cross your right foot in front of your left. Point. Curl downwards. Turn out.
In order to be sure that a given fungicide will actually work, you’ll first need to verify that you’re using the right product. Inspect your plants closely to look for symptoms like rotting, discoloration or a strange powdery residue. You can then conduct a quick search to find out the specific infection and how best to treat it.Rotten or blackened areas are typically a symptom of blights and leaf spots. Cankers most often appear as cracked, dried patches on the trunk or stem. Tiny spore-producing structures may sometimes spring up around the affected area. A mildew is likely to blame when fungal growth or discoloration begins to form on the leaves of the plant. Wilting occurs when an infection begins to kill a plant. Most of the time, wilted plants will need to be carefully pruned to remove the diseased sections.; , There, you’ll be able to find an extensive selection of fungicides, including organic formulas. You’ll also have a chance to describe your problem in greater detail to knowledgeable garden experts who can help you find a solution.Organic fungicides are also typically sold in the gardening departments of superstores like Walmart. If you’re unable to find the product you need in stores, try an online retailer that specializes in organic gardening supplies., However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re organic. Products that are truly organic must be made up of at least 70% organic compounds.It will be in the best interest of your garden to only use products that are certified organic. While shopping, check each product’s packaging to see if it’s been certified by the USDA. This means that the product was made using only organic active ingredients., Fungicides that come in powdered form can be sprinkled over the foliage, which will fight the infection without harming the plant. Liquid products, on the other hand, tend to work faster because the antifungal compounds have already been dissolved in water. There’s also less chance that they’ll be carried off due to wind or rainfall.While all fungicides are designed to do the same basic job, the method of application can make a big difference depending on the type of plant you’re treating, current weather conditions and other factors. Powdered fungicides tend to contain more concentrated amounts of chemicals, and aren't recommended for treating young or delicate plants., Copper has mildly acidic properties which make it useful for killing invasive bacteria and fungi. It can be used to clear up almost every type of infection, including blights, powdery mildew and anthracnose. For this reason, copper is a go-to solution for many organic gardening enthusiasts.Most commercial organic fungicides contain some amount of copper.In high concentrations, copper can be toxic to humans and animals. It should therefore be used sparingly to avoid creating deposits in the soil or runoff water.  Like copper, elemental sulfur is naturally antifungal. Plants displaying symptoms of leaf spots, rust or botrytis can benefit from regular application of the diluted chemical. Sulfur is more potent than other organic compounds, however, so it should be handled with caution.Never apply sulfur-based fungicides to young growth, or in extremely hot temperatures. If you’re not careful, it can burn right through the foliage. Avoid using sulfur on “sulfur shy” fruiting plants like grapes, gooseberries, currants and apricots., Bordeaux mixture is a special fungicide solution made from a combination of copper sulfate, lime and water. Gardeners have been using Bordeaux mixture for centuries to fight a multitude of botanical diseases while preserving the health of their plants.When putting together your own Bordeaux mixture, it’s best to follow the 4-4-50 rule—4 pounds (1.8kg) of copper sulfate and 4 pounds (1.8kg) of lime diluted in 50 gallons (189L) of water. This will produce a solution that’s strong yet safe.You can also purchase premade Bordeaux mixture. Commercial varieties are available in either dry or wet form to give you more control over their application.  Items like grain alcohol, apple cider vinegar, oil soaps and baking soda are readily available and helpful for eliminating infectious growth. Most of these substances can simply be diluted with a few ounces of water and applied using a spray bottle.Try whipping up a basic DIY fungicide solution by infusing alliums (pungent plants like crushed cloves, garlic and onions) in a small amount of water or citric acid. Homemade organic solutions will be most effective for dealing with slow-moving diseases such as blights and leaf spots. More serious infections like wilts should be pruned to keep them from spreading.Natural ingredients are generally mild enough to be used on plants of all species and ages, including seedlings and offshoots., The most important thing to remember when purchasing a fungicide is to select one that’s capable of killing the specific disease affecting your plants. The best way to do this is to compare a product’s active ingredients to the compounds recommended for treating a particular disease. Think of it as prescribing medicine to cure an illness.You can usually find a list of plants and diseases that a product can be safely used on somewhere on the packaging.In general, it’s a good idea to start with a gentle fungicide, such as apple cider vinegar or a bicarbonate spray (a mixture of water and baking soda). If that doesn't work, you can move on to more a intensive method like elemental sulfur.  Fungicide manufacturers provide specific directions for how to apply their products. Always go by these directions rather than attempting to figure it out yourself. If you use too much or too little fungicide, or apply a product under the wrong conditions, you could end up doing more harm than good.Different products will come with different instructions. Some organic fungicides like Soil Guardian are meant to be applied directly to the soil or to new seedlings. Others, like sulfur and lime, can cause damage to plants if applied in hot temperatures.If you're using a homemade remedy, it's best to apply the solution once or twice a day, then observe the plant's health after a couple days. If it doesn't appear to be working, you may need to increase the frequency or try a more potent fungicide.  Once you’ve determined the correct amount of product to use (diluting it as needed), load the sprayer and spray it lightly and evenly over the plant. Try to cover all affected parts of the foliage. For your own safety, be sure to wear gloves, goggles, a breather or ventilator and protective long-sleeved clothing.Wait for clear, dry, windless weather to prevent runoff and keep the fungicide from blowing back on you or other unaffected parts of your garden.When applying a powdered fungicide, spray the plant lightly with water beforehand to help it stick.  Diseases won't typically clear up over night. It may be necessary to regularly reapply the fungicide to keep an infection under control. Only use as much fungicide as directed for each application and make sure the plant receives plenty of water and sunlight in the meantime. With proper care, you should notice an improvement within a few short weeks.Most experts recommend applying fungicides every five days for roughly three weeks. Be sure to follow the specific instructions included with the fungicide you select. It will help to keep the plant pruned, dry and separated from other plants while you attempt to combat the disease.	Identify the disease infecting your plants. Visit your local gardening center. Learn the difference between “natural” and “organic.” Fungicides marketed as “all natural” may contain natural active ingredients (such as copper or sulfur). Decide whether you need a powdered or liquid product. Treat common diseases with copper. Use sulfur to deal with serious infections. Make your own Bordeaux mixture. Try a homemade remedy. Use a fungicide that's formulated for the disease you're treating. Follow the included instructions. Sprinkle or spray on the fungicide. Repeat as needed.
Heavy digging and cultivation can cause weed seeds to come to the surface and begin growing. Only disturb the soil when you have to, so that you don’t inadvertently raise weed seeds.Weed seeds can lay dormant under the soil for years.Hoeing or tilling in weed prone areas may inadvertently bring up dormant weed seeds in the process.; , If you are having an issue with weeds growing in between cracks in a walkway or sidewalk, try using salt to prevent future weed growth. Be warned that salt will also kill other vegetation in the area, so make sure to use it only in spots that are weed prone.   Amine salt is a good solution for killing weeds and can be combined with water in a spray bottle for easier application.Borax is another, more caustic solution to killing weeds in small cracks. Make sure to use gloves when handling it., Weeds like to grow in open areas that are abundant in nutrients and minerals. You can prevent them by maintaining a thick and healthy lawn that has grass and other lawn plants to compete with weeds that may want to grow in the area.   Keeping your lawn fertilized will promote healthy growth for all plants on your lawn or garden bed.Reseeding lawns in the fall will promote healthy grass growth next season because many weeds die late in the fall, and the grass seeds will have less to compete with.	Refrain from disturbing the soil. Sprinkle weed prone sidewalks with salt. Maintain a thick and healthy lawn.
Wood sorrel enjoys growing close to the ground. It springs up in woodlands and on shaded slopes. One type of wood sorrel is also considered a weed that grows commonly on lawns in eastern North America., Sorrel is quickly recognizable by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers cluster near to the ground and have five petals apiece. White and yellow are its common colors, although there are pink and violet variants., When you are unsure, look at the leaves. Sorrel leaves grow in clusters of three. The leaves look heart-shaped with a fold down the center. The leaf veins branch off from the middle of the main vein, unlike in clover leaves, where many veins split off in parallel lines from each other., The outer leaves are mature. Leave behind the small leaves, which are near the stem. The leaves can simply be picked off by hand or cut using a knife.You can take some of the leaf cluster stems, but most of them will be too tough.  As spring progresses, the edible flowers will begin to bloom. Once they have grown, cut them off for use as a garnish. You may also cut them off before they blossom so that the plant's leaves grow quicker., You’ll see tiny pods growing on separate stems underneath the leaves. They look green and resemble pea pods. When they are small and immature, they can also be cut off and eaten., Place what you’ve picked under cold, running water. Remove any rotten parts as you go. Set the sorrel aside and allow it to dry. When used immediately, sorrel will taste best, but you can keep sorrel for several days in a sealed plastic bag., Excess sorrel can be dried out and crumbled over food. Line the sorrel on a pan in the oven or in a dry area under sunlight. When using an oven, set the heat as low as possible. Once the sorrel is dried out, store it in a sealed jar., Boil a pot of water. Drop the leaves in and leave them there for two minutes. Remove the leaves and immediately place them in a bowl of ice cold water. Drain off the moisture, seal the sorrel in a freezer container, and then store it in the freezer. It will last up to a year.The leaves can also be blended into a liquid and added to an ice cube tray. Freeze and then move the sorrel blocks to a freezer container. Another way to do this is to steam the leaves, roll them up, then move them to a sealed container inside the freezer.  Finely chop or blend leaves. Place the leaves in a jar and mix them with vinegar and sugar. You’ll have a green sauce that will last indefinitely when refrigerated.You can also keep the leaves whole and cover them in olive oil. Push down on the leaves in the jar to remove air. Store them in the refrigerator for up to three weeks.	Check shaded areas. Look for white or yellow flowers. Identify the heart-shaped leaves. Pick the outer leaves. Cut off maturing flowers. Collect seed pods. Rinse off the sorrel. Bake leaves to dry them. Blanche and freeze leftover leaves. Preserve leaves by pickling.
If you want your string braid to be one color, cut three lengths of the same string. If you want a multi-colored braid, cut three lengths of string in different colors.   Make sure that you cut the string in the same exact length each time. A length of one foot is a good starting point for braiding string.; , Pull them so that they are even.  Cut a three-inch (7.5cm) piece of tape and then tape the knotted end to the table.   Smooth the tape on the table’s surface so that it will stay while you pull on the string., Pick up the right string between your right thumb and index finger. Pick up the left string between your left thumb and index finger.  As you braid, you will pass the middle string between the middle fingers of your right and left hands.  Your wrist will turn counterclockwise.  Twist the left string over center string. You wrist will rotate clockwise. , With practice, you will learn to control the tightness of the braid.	Purchase spools of string. Gather the ends of the string. Tie a knot 2 inches from one end. Separate the three pieces of string on the table. Pick up the third, and middle, string with your right middle finger. Twist the right string toward the center, over the middle string. Grasp the new center string with your left middle finger. Repeat this motion, exchanging the right string for the center string and the left string for the center string until you reach the end of your string.  , Twist tightly so that your string braid is tight. Knot the end.
It can be any size, since you can cut the molding to whatever length you need. The mirror does need to have straight edges, like a rectangle or square shape, as opposed to a round one.; , You can find molding at a lumberyard or a home supply store, usually for just a few dollars a foot.   Choose a style of molding: There are traditional, unfinished styles and more decorative ones that come with rosette corners and different patterns. To determine how long each piece of molding should be, measure the length and width of your mirror, then add 2 inches (5.1 cm). Use a miter saw to cut the four pieces, and cut 45-degree miters on both ends of each piece. Check the opposite parts' lengths by holding them against each other to make sure they're equal. Assemble the frame on a flat surface: Paint the inside of the corners with construction adhesive or wood glue, and then use painters' tape to hold the pieces together temporarily. After the adhesive dries, fill in any gaps in the miters with Spackle or wood putty. After the spackle dries, paint the frame, if you wish.  Your backboard should be a piece of plywood that is also two inches longer and wider than the mirror. If your mirror is already on the wall, you don't need a backboard, and you can skip this step.  Your lattice pieces should be two inches wide; two of the pieces should be the length of the mirror, and two should be two inches longer, so that they frame the entire perimeter of the square. This is another step you can skip if your mirror is already on the wall.   Use wood adhesive to attach the lattice pieces to the backboard. Make sure the mirror is fitted snugly inside the lattice pieces. Secure the lattice pieces with spring clamps, and let the adhesive dry for about 24 hours.  Line them up so that they extend just slightly over the lattice edges onto the mirror. Glue the molding to the lattice pieces.   Be careful not to get any glue on the mirror. If you are using rosettes, glue them into each corner. Weight the mirror with a piece of plywood, and let the glue set for about 24 hours. Cover the molding with towels to protect the wood while the glue dries.  Immediately check the frame with a level, and then make any adjustments before the glue dries. Use painters' tape to hold the frame to the wall while the glue dries.  Turn your molded mirror over, and use an electric screwdriver to screw a one-inch screw into the center of each rosette. Insert two evenly spaced screws into each horizontal piece and one into each vertical piece, about a third of the way from the bottom.  Insert one into each vertical side, about a third of the way down.   Cut the wire long enough to run between the two rings, with enough for the peak of the wire to hit three inches below the top of the frame. Twist the wire into each D-ring. Attach vinyl picture bumpers to each corner, to prevent the mirror from scratching the wall.  Finish the mirror by sanding the edges of the frame, if they are rough, using a sanding sponge or sandpaper. You can also opt to paint the frame with a glossy finish.	Select the mirror. Purchase and cut the molding. Center the mirror on the backboard. Glue the lattice pieces around the mirror. Lay the molding pieces on top of the lattice pieces. If you are framing a mirror that's already hung on a wall, apply your adhesive to the back of the molding, and press the frame against the mirror, leaving a one-inch overhang on all four sides of the mirror. Secure the molding to the backboard. Attach a hanging picture wire using two D-rings. Add finishing touches, and then hang the mirror.
Citrus fruit that is less than 2.5cm/1 inch in diameter is often in abundance and the tree cannot carry all these fruits to maturity. Some of these will fall naturally as part of a thinning out.,   Citrus trees that are not watered adequately have a tendency to drop their fruit prematurely. The next season, be sure to mulch adequately around the tree to improve water retention and keep an eye on its need for more water. Equally, over-watering can force fruit dropping.  A citrus tree subjected to frosts as the fruit develops is more likely to drop the fruit.  A lack of potash is a common cause of citrus trees dropping fruit before it is ready to eat. Always prefer a specialized citrus fertilizer over a more general one as the nutrient balance will be right for the tree.  The citrus rust mite can cause discolored portions on citrus fruit; the mite is best squashed rather than sprayed as you will also lose beneficial life on the tree. And the fruit still tastes just fine and is not damaged by this mite.	Expect some natural fruit thinning. Assess the level of water provided to the citrus tree. See if the tree has been frost affected. Check the nutrient levels of your citrus tree. Look for a mite if you have fruit discoloration problems.
Starting from one of the narrow ends, fold your bill like a fan or accordion using ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) folds. Do this for all of the bills that you have.You will need about 30 to 35 bills., Cut some colored paper down to the same size as your bills, about 2½ by 6 inches (6.35 by 15.24 centimeters) first.Then, fold them into fans starting from the narrow edge. You will need about 30 to 35 pieces as well.Add school spirit by using one or both of your school's colors. Cardstock or colored printer paper will give you a nicer look, but you can use construction paper if you have nothing else.  Fold your fan in half, widthwise. Tape the two side edges together. When you are done, you should have a half-circle, fan shape.Do this for all of the folded bills and colored pieces of paper. Set them aside when you are done.  This will make the base of the lei.The ribbon can be any color you want, but something that matches one of the school's colors would be ideal.  Seal the ends of the ribbon with a flame. This will keep it from fraying., Place the flat side of your first fan against the ribbon. Fold the two ends together over the ribbon, sandwiching it in between. You should now have something that looks like a disk. Tape the two ends of the paper together to secure the disk.Start from the center of the ribbon and work your way outward.  Alternate between money and paper. You can do money-paper-money, or money-money-paper. Stop when you have about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) of ribbon left on each side., If you have enough ribbon left over, you can tie the ends into a bow. This is not completely necessary, but it will give the lei a nicer touch.	Fold a dollar bill into a fan. Make some more fans using colored paper, if desired. Tape the edges of your fan together. Cut a 4-foot (1.2-meter) long piece of ribbon. Start taping the folded fans to the ribbon. Continue taping the folded fans to the ribbon. Tie the ends of the ribbon together.
The more organic material in your soil, the better chance your plants are going to thrive.Topsoil that is too light in color is lacking this material, and will impede the growth of any plants or food that you are trying to plant. In addition, check the surface of the soil for a light or white residue that may indicate the presence of salts or lime, which are both chemicals that can have toxic effects on a garden or lawn.Extremely black topsoil indicates a lack of minerals in your soil. Look for something that’s dark brown, but not black.If the topsoil you want to buy has already been packaged, ask the owner if he has any sample soil you can look at. If the soil is blue-green or gray, it means it’s been continuously wet or saturated which is not good for topsoil. Avoid buying soil that looks like this.; , A quick run of your fingers through the soil will give you a good idea of what it’s made up of. Good topsoil should crumble in your fingers. You should feel the grit in it which indicates minerals that are needed for your plants like phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium. Avoid soil that is too hard, as it indicates low organic matter.Soil that clumps up into balls or large chunks is too rich in clay. Topsoil that is heavy in clay interferes with plant’s ability to aerate and stops water from effectively reaching the plant’s roots.Look for large stones or weed roots which are also bad for topsoil.  Ideally your topsoil is going to be a perfect combination of silt, clay, and sand. Place a portion of wet soil in the palm of your hand. Rub the sand around and pour a little more water over it while it's in your hand. As the sand becomes wet, you can physically feel for its properties. Gritty soil indicates high sand, smoothness indicates high silt, and stickiness indicates high clay. The sand should be dark and posses a combination of stickiness, grittiness, and smoothness. Ideally you don’t want any one element dominating your topsoil. It should be an equal combination of all three.You can also see if your soil has any unwanted seeds while doing this. If the topsoil you’re examining is not ideal, ask the soil seller if he has anything else available.  Good topsoil will smell sweet. Avoid any soils that have an off-odor or smell like chemicals such as gasoline. This indicates unwanted and unnatural chemicals which can stop plants from growing, and makes for terrible topsoil.Topsoil takes hundreds of years to be created naturally, and decomposition should have already taken place. If the soil in question smells like rotting material, stay clear of it.	Look for a darker tone in the soil. Touch the soil to make sure that it’s crumbly and has a good texture. Wet a sample of the soil to see what it’s made of. Smell the soil and make sure that it smells sweet.
Different air conditioners have different filter cleaning requirements. Some filters need to be cleaned once every two weeks.Some manufacturers recommend cleaning just once every 30 days.Still others require cleaning only one to four times per year.Consult your manufacturer’s directions for information about how often you should clean your filter. You should clean your filter more frequently if you have pets or allergies, or if you’re using your air conditioner regularly.  Despite your careful and regular cleaning, your filter will eventually wear out. If you notice and tears, holes, or damage to your filter, replace it with a new one.You can buy an air conditioner filter at your local home appliances store or online.  Cleaning the condenser coils can make your air conditioner more efficient and improve its lifetime. If you have a window-mounted air conditioner, you’ll need to blow compressed air in short bursts at the back end of the unit (the part of the air conditioner that sticks out the window).Alternately, use a soft-bristled brush to scrub between the grating of the air conditioner’s intake. Be careful not to bend any of the coil fins. If you want to clean the condenser coils of your large central air conditioner unit outside, remove its outer case, then blow compressed air across its surface in short bursts. You could also choose to use an industrial-strength vacuum fitted with a soft-bristle brush attachment to suck the grime and dirt from where it has collected between the coils.	Clean your filter regularly. Discard your filter if necessary. Clean the condenser coils.
If you are able to buy large trees and shrubs you will be able to have an instant garden; if you can’t afford them then you will need patience to grow young plants. For instance, Perennials can bloom and reach their maximum height in the first couple of years, so don’t spend money on big plants. Besides, it will be very interesting to see them grow as time goes by.  Many people get excited and try to cram too much into a small space, but overcrowded plants tend to be unhealthy, so always think about what their final spreads will be when drawing up your plan. The best way to make your plants look fuller is to put them all in a group together.  If you group plants in the shape of a sausage (which works well for cottage and prairie styles), or in triangle shapes they will look better and you will be able to create harmony among disparate groups.	Figure out the cost of your plants. Organize your plants. Decide which shape to use to group the plants.
If the saddle's base is uneven, the strings may be supported at different heights, changing the intonation. You may push shims underneath the saddle to correct this, but this can make the saddle more fragile.It's much more effective to compensate the saddle, but this repairs requires wood tools and the skill of a professional luthier.  To measure this, you'll need a cheap tool called a radius gauge. Place the radius onto the 12th fret, cycling through the gauges until you find a good fit. Now place that gauge on the saddle, after tuning your guitar. The tool should touch and mute both E strings, and get close enough to the middle four strings to cause a sitar-like buzz.  You can also measure string height with a ruler with 132{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{32}}} inch marks. The bottom of the low E string should be 332{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{32}}} inches away from the 12th fret, and the high e string should be 232{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{32}}} away.  If you want to try this yourself, you can buy a pre-compensated saddle that you think will adjust the problem strings in the correct direction. The results are usually not perfect, but the cost is lower than a professional repair, usually falling between $5 and $100 US depending on material.  You can also buy "blanks" and experiment in filing your own compensations into the saddle. Be sure to leave a sharp edge on the lower side of the saddle to stop all string vibration there.  In some cases, a weak soundboard provides an unstable surface for the bridge, knocking it out of alignment. This is a diagnosis and repair best done by a professional.  Some guitarists who want their intonation as perfect as possible claim that certain unusual fret boards improve the setup. Fanned-fret guitars are one example.	Check that the saddle lies flat and even. Install a pre-compensated saddle. Reinforce the soundboard. Buy a guitar with non-standard frets.
Purchase a cutting of horseradish from a greenhouse or grocery store. Most of the time, these places will sell crowns (the uppermost part of the plant) or roots that are pre-cut and ready to plant. Most gardeners start horseradish from crowns, as the plant grows from the roots and only its weed-like flowers produce seeds.Like carrots or potatoes, horseradish roots are ready to go straight into the ground.; , Set aside an area in the corner of your garden to plant the horseradish crop, or designate a unique space such as a barrel or hanging planter to keep it from overtaking other plants. Horseradish takes roots quickly and flourishes in cool conditions, and it can quickly spread throughout your garden if you don’t check its growth.Horseradish is a perennial, so plant it somewhere you'd like to have it growing for years to come. If you are working with a smaller garden, look into alternative planting methods such as terracing or using contained planting methods like a half barrel or Smart Pot., Loosen the soil about 12 inches deep where you decide to plant the horseradish. Make the hole wide enough to accommodate the entire length of the root, as it should be planted at an angle. Space the horseradish 18-20 inches (46-51 centimeters) away from the nearest plant so that the roots have plenty of room to spread and grow.  Place the horseradish crown or root into the hole at roughly a 45 degree angle, with the thinner, bottom portion of the root slanted down. This will allow the roots to radiate out beneath the soil while keeping the leaves of the crown vertical above ground. Fill the hole with a shovelful of compost to act as a fertilizer.         Horseradish roots can be buried completely, or you can leave the top of the root visible to track its development.  Horseradish should ideally be grown somewhere open with ample sun exposure, but a slightly shaded area is also acceptable. Unlike more temperamental plants, horseradish doesn’t require direct sunlight to thrive, although it will help it grow faster. Avoid planting horseradish near walls or fences or beneath trees that might strangle root growth.Horseradishes are perennial plants, so they will come back every year.  Horseradish roots are very good at retaining moisture and therefore only require watering once or twice throughout the week. Water horseradish plants more frequently in the hot summer months when the soil tends to be drier. Be careful not to overwater horseradish, as this is one of the few conditions that can be harmful to its survival.When watering horseradish, it’s only necessary to keep the soil around the roots slightly damp. Don’t drown them.  Fertilize during the spring with a high-phosphorus, low-nitrogen fertilizer. Fertilizing is optional, as the compost you used to plant the horseradish should provide sufficient nourishment, but can help the roots grow larger. Keep an eye on the progress of developing horseradish plants and use a fertilizer if the plants’ growth seems stunted or if soil health is poor.Do not fertilize more than once per growing season: in the case of horseradish, once a year in the springtime.  As the horseradish grows, it will begin to sprout tall leaves known as “suckers” and various types of weeds. Keep these pruned down to prevent them from spreading. A healthy horseradish plant should have only 3-4 leaf stalks—any more may cause unintended spreading and irregular shaped roots should they be allowed to continue growing.Horseradish weeds can also spread undesirably to other plants. Some weeds take the form of tall, spiked stalks that grow white flowers. This is a common sign that the horseradish has survived the harshest winter weather., A cold-hardy vegetable, horseradish reaches its peak in size and flavor after it has been through a frost, so wait until late fall to harvest horseradish crops. It usually takes around one year for a horseradish plant to reach maturity after its initial planting, so if you first planted the root in fall it should be ready to harvest by the following fall.The growing season for horseradish is one year from fall to fall. A harsh frost will often kill off the foliage that grows at the crown of the plant. This is a good way to know when the horseradish is ready to be pulled., Use a shovel or trowel to gently loosen the soil beneath the plant’s leaf stalks. Once the root is visible, take hold of it and pull until the entire root system has been removed. Fully-grown horseradish plants will be between 6-10 inches in length, so dig deep to keep from damaging the root.         Accidentally severing any part of the root may result in unwanted growth and spreading.  Snip away the green leaf stalks on the horseradish crown. These can be thrown away or used as compost. Cut the horseradish into small, thin sections that can easily be used later for cooking or other purposes. Unused horseradish can be stored in a plastic sandwich bag and will keep in the refrigerator for 3 months or longer.         If you know you want to continue growing horseradish, let a few root segments remain in the soil when you harvest. Wash and dry horseradish roots thoroughly before using them to prepare food.  If you decide to replant the harvested horseradish, cut the plant roughly 3-4 inches beneath the crown (around the root’s midpoint) and return the root portion to the soil, keeping the crown portion to use in the kitchen. The roots will reestablish themselves on their own, and you can resume regular watering and weeding.     Although the crown of the horseradish can produce a new plant, best results will be achieved by replanting the root system. If you don’t want the horseradish plant to return after a harvest, you’ll need to make sure that all traces of the plant’s roots have been removed from the soil. Otherwise, they will continue to take up growing.	Obtain horseradish crowns or roots to plant. Find an out of the way place to plant the horseradish. Dig a hole about a foot deep. Plant the horseradish diagonally. Make sure the plant gets plenty of sunlight. Water the horseradish once or twice a week. Fertilize as needed. Prune suckers and weeds from the plant. Wait until late fall to harvest horseradish. Loosen the soil around the roots and remove the plant. Cut away small sections of horseradish to use or store. Replant roots sections to keep the plant growing.
Dry storage may ultimately be less expensive than storing your boat in the water, and dry-stored boats are less likely to develop blisters on their hulls. However, dry-stored boats may be more susceptible to damage from sudden freezes than boats stored in the water. Consider your local climate and discuss your options with boating experts in your area., You may wish to rent a climate-controlled storage unit, store your boat in a heated garage on your property, or store your boat in a dry-stacking facility. These options will help protect your boat from the elements, and may be especially important in areas where hurricanes and winter storms are a concern., This is a good idea even if the boat will be stored in a heated garage or another type of storage facility. Your cover should be tight fitting, waterproof, and strong enough to hold up if snow or debris falls on it. Whichever type of cover you choose should be well ventilated to prevent trapped moisture inside your boat.A few popular types of boat coverings are:Shrink wrap. The major downside to shrink wrap is that it can trap moisture and lead to mildew if not properly treated and ventilated. Custom fabric covers. While the up-front cost of a fabric cover may be high, it can be re-used for many years, and will ultimately cost you less than repeated applications of shrink wrap. Fabric covers also have the advantages of being well-ventilated and easy to remove and replace. Polyethylene tarps. Tarps are a fairly inexpensive boat covering solution, but the tarp you select should be thick, and must be supported to prevent damage to your boat from accumulation of snow and debris. You may need to build a frame out of wood or PVC pipe that can be fitted over your boat to support the tarp cover.	Decide between wet or dry storage. Store your boat in a climate-controlled setting, if possible. Cover your boat.
Depending on your reasons for making the video, you may want to invest in a high-quality camera to create a professional-looking project, or you may want to use whatever is available for a cheaper option. Whatever the case, getting a camera to shoot video on should be your first step.    Cellphone videos are super-cheap and really easy to use. They can be a little shaky, however, and the sound is usually not very good, but if you want to grab some video quickly and easily, the camera on your cell is a good option.  Digital photo cameras regularly have video features, and some are quite cheap and fairly high-quality. Cameras with SD cards are widely available and user-friendly.  HD Cameras can run anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars and will look very professional. Many low-budget Hollywood movies have been shot on basic HD cameras you can buy at electronics stores like Best Buy, or even explore renting options in your area.; , Whether you're shooting a birthday party, concert, a wedding, or some other event, get to the place early and do some scouting to see the right angles for shooting video. Find a few comfortable positions and shoot from multiple angles to get different footage that you'll be able to edit together later into a nice product.   If you've got a helper, you can shoot simultaneously from different angles to provide cuts in your finished product with editing. This can be a cool effect that will make your finished product seem finished and professional. Try to stay out of peoples' way, especially if there's a sizable crowd. You want to get the close shot and the right angle, but you're not the only one there. Make sure everyone can see and shoot from a reasonable distance., To be ready for spontaneous moments, keep the camera going! Pick the right time to start and let the camera warm up, so the video begins before the actual action you want to capture. If you Try to fire up the camera when you see your kid sprinting toward the goal, ready to take a shot in the championship soccer game, it's likely you'll miss it. If you've been filming since half-time, though, you'll be ready.   Don't try to edit together your video on the fly. It's better to avoid lots of stops and starts to the video, because you'll have trouble remember what shot happened when, which will be much easier to sort out if you've got longer shots. You can edit out the unnecessary bits later, but most cameras have lots of room on them, so take advantage of it.  If you're using the camera on your cellphone, or any camera that isn't steadied with a tripod, Try to hold it as steady as possible. Shakiness and blurriness from an unsteady hand can make important video footage frustrating and unwatchable. Sit down while shooting and steady your arms on your knees, if necessary, or invest in a tripod that'll keep the camera steady on the ground.   A common mistake on iPhone cameras involves holding the phone vertically while taking video, as opposed to horizontally. When you upload the video to your computer later to edit it (if you want to) you'll have annoying bars on either side of the screen. Shoot the "landscape" style and hold the camera long-ways. It'll show up sideways on your phone, but you can tilt it later on your computer and it'll look right.  If you're just using the built-in mic on your camera and not trying to capture sound with other microphones, you'll have a lot of trouble hearing the action unless you're quite close.	Get a camera. Find the best angles. Keep rolling. Stay as steady as possible. Get as close as possible if you want to capture sound.
Imitation is often the quickest way to learn the basics of something, and screaming is no exception. Try to find a singer who does not scream his or her entire vocals. Instead, when learning how to master this, try listening to a song where there's a scream within the song, but doesn't scream all the lyrics.   As you practice your own scream, you can vary the style to suit your voice and image as desired. For now, however, focus simply on producing the basic sound and worry about tailoring it to your own tastes later on.; , Screaming will be much less harsh on your throat if you moisten your throat first. Something lukewarm or warm is preferably to something cold, since warm fluids can soothe the throat while cold fluids can cause the muscles to tighten and ultimately feel more sore.   Warm tea with honey is one of the best options, but you could also settle for lukewarm water or room temperature juice. Avoid cold drinks. Stay away from drinks containing caffeine or alcohol, since these will only dry out your throat more.    Take a deep breathe through your nose before you begin to get as much air into your lungs as possible. The more air you start with, the longer you can sustain the sound. Breathe out from the diaphragm. The air should be forced up from the bottom of your lungs, and you should force it out in a controlled, steady stream instead of letting it loose all at once.  Narrow your throat so that there is only a small gap for you to force air through. Apply more energy to your "ah" until you can eventually feel the sound between your throat and chest.   Your throat should be as tightly closed together as it can be while still allowing air to flow through.  If you take your time, it could take several weeks of consistent practice before you master this scream. You should still practice this slowly to avoid ruining your throat, though.   If your throat begins to hurt as you practice your screaming, stop immediately and drink something warm. Warm tea with honey is especially good at this point. Only continue with your practice when your throat feels completely fine.	Listen to any singer who screams. Drink something warm. Whisper the "ah" sound.Force out a lot of air as you whisper, but make sure that you can retain enough air to sustain the sound for 15 to 30 seconds. Close your throat and apply more force. Practice.

You might have noticed going over potholes and bumps isn't as smooth as it used to be in your ride, which is probably a sign that your shocks are worn out and need replaced. A good easy way to test your shocks and make sure they're worn out enough to be replaced is to push down hard on the trunk or the hood directly above the wheel well. Good shocks should bounce up once and settle relatively quickly. If the body bounces any more than that after pushing, it's time for a new set.   You also need to know if your vehicle uses stand-alone shocks that attach to the vehicle suspension or frame, or if it uses shock-absorber units which integrated into a suspension strut, such as the MacPherson or Chapman strut. Your car may even have a combination, using shocks in the front and struts in the back. Struts can be difficult to replace, so it's best to let a professional handle that job.; , If you're unsure what type of shock absorbers you need, speak to someone at your local auto parts store or an auto mechanic to be sure you buy the right shock absorbers or piston for your vehicle.  You can get identical replacements of the shocks you have in your car currently, but taking the time to change out your shocks is also a good opportunity to perform any upgrades, if you're interested. Performance shocks are appropriate for heavy-use daily drive vehicles, especially trucks.Coil shocks are manufactured with a coiled spring around the body of the shock, which supports the weight of the vehicle and controls the movement of the suspension. These are adjustable, which means you can alter the height of your truck for optimum performance.  Twin-tube shocks have a set of tubes, one inner and one out, that house the piston, along with a layer of shock fluid and air, which can have a tendency to create a foamy, frothy mixture that can affect performance, though some modern variations feature a nitrogen mixture that addresses the issue. These are common on off-road vehicles.  Monotube shocks feature a tube and two pistons, which work essentially like the twin-tube shocks work, with one piston separating the layer of nitrogen from the air. It runs cool and is a popular performance choice for trucks.  Reservoir shocks are filled with fluid, and either pressurized air or nitrogen. As the shock absorbs bounce, the fluid contacts the gas, causing resistance and dampening the spring action.  Park your car on a level surface and loosen the lug nuts on both sides of the front or back end. Secure your vehicle with ramps and/or jack stands. Check your owner's manual for the correct jack positioning. When you've got the car up, remove the wheels and locate the shocks.   Shocks will be affixed with a vertical bolt that has to be extracted from within the engine bay or the trunk, or may be positioned at the top by a horizontal bolt that has to be unfastened and knocked out of position.  The most difficult part of the job is removing the old shocks, which can have a tendency to be really gunky with both age and road-grit, making the bushings and bolts somewhat difficult to remove. Check out the mountings to see if they're loose enough to get off, or if you're likely to crack the rubber around the bushing. It's ok if you do, since you're changing out the shock anyway, but it's usually easier to spray some WD-40 or PB Blaster in there and let it sit for a few minutes to try to loosen things up before you get to work.  Lots of cars have the top bolts under the fabric in the trunk of the car, which means you'll have to lift up the lining to get to the shock bolts and remove them with a ratchet and socket. As always, consult your shop manual for more specific guidelines regarding the location of the shock tower bolts. In general, though, they'll be in the trunk.   To unfasten the bolts, turn the socket and ratchet counterclockwise, greasing the bolts with penetrating fluid to eliminate any surface rust, if necessary.  Use a socket set or a nut splitter to disengage the nut that connecting the shock to the suspension, and remove it from the bolt. If there isn't enough room to operate the splitter, you can apply penetrating solvent.   Depending on the assembly, you may also need to disengage the knuckle at the top of brake assembly to get the the shock. Consult your owner's manual to find out for sure. Use the same process to remove the nut that is positioned at the top and keep the nuts separate so you will know which one goes where when it is time to install your new shocks., Wiggling the shock off the bolts can be surprisingly difficult, especially if the shocks are mounted on studs with a retaining bracket and everything's rusty. Wiggle it around a while and it should come off eventually.   One common frustration occurs when your piston rod keeps turning with you as you're trying to loosen the nut. You can use locking pliers on the end of the rod and keep it from turning with the pliers while loosening the nut with a wrench, but that can be just as frustrating. There's a hollow hex kit that fits over the rod and a tailored wrench made for the purpose, available at any auto parts store for about eleven bucks. If you need to bang on the bolt with a hammer or the end of your wrench to get it loose, that's ok, but make sure you put one the nuts back on to use as a hitting surface. Don't risk misaligning the bolt and messing up your ability to reinstall the shock properly. Let the metal cleaner do its work and take your time. It'll give.  You might need to use some pressure to constrict the shock as it falls into place, and you might need a help to help lift the suspension back up to reinstall the bolts in the correct positions. It can be kind of a balancing act, so it helps to have another set of hands. Screw on the nuts hand tight.  Reattach it and screw the bolts back on hand-tight. Replace the shock tower nuts you removed at the beginning of the process, probably in the trunk of the vehicle.  Before you go tightening everything back down, recheck the specifications for torque to be sure everything's secure.  Most of the shocks should wear out at the same time, so if you're going to do one, you're probably going to end up doing them all. Do in following the same steps and then put the wheels back on and tighten the lug nuts to finish the job.	Make sure you need new shocks. Purchase new shock absorbers. Consider upgrading your shocks. Jack your vehicle in an appropriate location. Check the shock mountings and spray them with metal cleaner. Remove bolts from the shock tower. Disconnect the shock from the suspension. Remove the shock absorber from the bottom and top bolts. Fit the new shock back onto the suspension control arm. If needed, you may once again affix the anti-roll bar if you removed it earlier. Check your torque specs in the service manual. Repeat the steps to replace the other 3 shock absorbers, if necessary.
This will be the length of your glove. The finished glove will extend from the top of your palm/knuckles, down past your wrist, and onto your forearm. If you want a shorter glove, cast on fewer stitches. If you want a longer glove, cast on more stitches.Leave a long tail on you yarn. You'll be using it to stitch the glove together in the end. Use medium worsted weight yarn (size 4) and size 8 knitting needles.; , This will create a bumpy, purl pattern on both sides of you work. How many rows you knit depends on how wide your palm/forearm is. For most people, however, this will be about 48 rows.Do not alternate between knitting and purling. You want to knit on every row. This will allow the glove to stretch both ways  , Cast off your work first. Cut the yarn, and pull the tail end through the last loop. Gently tug on the tail end to tighten the loop. Do not cut the tail end off.  The cast on and cast off stitches should run up the side of your arm and palm. The side edges of the piece are now the top and bottom of your glove. Place your hand over the folded piece, with the top of your palm against the top edge. Take note where you thumb starts.  Thread the tail end onto a yarn needle. Keeping your work folded in half, whipstitch down the long, side edge until you reach your thumb.Pass the needle through both of the edges of the piece.  Once the top part of your glove is long enough to reach your thumb, tie the yarn to itself. Weave the tail end back up the seam, then trim the excess off.  Place your hand against the glove, and note where your wrist is/the base of your thumb is. This will be about 5 inches (12 centimeters). Thread the bottom tail end of your work, and sew up the side of your glove using a whipstitch. Stop when you reach the wrist area/base of your thumb., When the glove is sewn together, you'll have a hole in the side seam for your thumb. If you are happy with the size of the hole, tie the yarn to itself. Weave the tail end back down a few inches/centimeters, then cut the excess off.  These gloves are reversible. There is no left or right glove, so you can measure the second glove against the same hand.	Cast on about 40 stitches. Knit every row until the glove is wide enough to wrap around your palm or forearm. Cast off, then tie the yarn off. Fold your work in half, lengthwise. Sew down the first 2 inches (5 centimeters) of so of your glove. Tie the tail off, then weave it back up the seam. Sew up the bottom edge of your glove. Tie the tail off and weave it down the seam. Repeat the process for the other glove.
You can find them cheaply online. You'll need a few more tools, too, listed below.; , This is where we'll connect the step-up step-down module.  Pull out the tiny wires inside.  We only need the red and black wires in the cable.  Be careful not to use too much pressure. The wires are very small; too much pressure and you'll cut the wire instead of stripping it.  The end that goes into the PC/console gets screwed to the "IN" terminals and the other end for the headset gets screwed to the "OUT" terminals. Red wire for the positive and black wire for the negative.  To do this, plug in the USB cable into your PC or console. You'll be using the USB ports on the PC or gaming console as your power source, but really you could even plug it into a phone charger and use that as your power source. This particular module can take any input of 3.5-28V and give an output of 1.25V-26V. Once it's plugged in you'll need to use our 1.4mm screwdriver to adjust the small screw on the module. Using your multimeter to read the voltage, turn the screw until the output of the module reads 3V. , Pull out the wires.  Strip the ends of the red and black wires. Set the cable aside for now. , Be careful of the part with the speaker in it. It is only connected by two small wires that could pull out of their soldered joint.  (Alternatively, you can drill a hole through the side to insert the cable through. Use a bit slightly larger than you USB cable. Use silicone, or more preferably, a hot glue gun to keep the wire in place.)  , There should be a speaker wire connected here.  Make sure you solder it to the one with speaker wire as well. Keep in mind you aren't soldering these wires to either of the terminals that has the red wire connecting the positive and negative terminals.  You've just turned your wireless headset into a wired headset!   Just remember we aren't replacing any receiver, just the batteries, so don't throw it out!	Buy a DC-DC step-up step-down module. Cut the USB cable about 6" - 10" from the end that plugs into your PC or console. Use the utility knife to slice the insulation of the USB cable, about an inch down from where you cut it, on both sides. Cut away the other wires and excess insulation. Use your wire cutters to strip about half of the each exposed wire. Twist the bare stranded copper and insert them into the module. Adjust the voltage output of the module. Cut the other end of the USB cable off (the end that would plug into a phone or something).  , Use the utility knife and slice the insulation about 3" - 4" down from the cut. Cut away the excess wires and insulation. Remove the ear pad from the side that the batteries insert into.  , Use a small screwdriver (or T6 Torx if you're working on the X42) to remove the screws and reveal the wires insides. Take off the cover for the batteries and insert the end of the USB cable in through the opening by the spring. Using the soldering iron, solder the red wire to the positive terminal. Solder the black wire to the negative terminal (the one with spring on the other side). Close it all back up and put the ear pad back on.
A ladder stitch brings two areas of the hem together to match a project that has been sewn inside out to create a hem. The area you use to turn the project right side out will be the area you will ladder stitch.       ; , You may need to pop the corners out with a sewing needle through the entry point. You may also need to stuff the inside of the project before sewing up this last part of the hem.  You want it to match the seam allowance on both sides of the stitch. If it doesn’t stay turned inward very easily, you can iron the open section so that it will lay flat while it is turned in.  If possible, hook your pin through the rough edge of the hem on the inside of the opening. It will be less likely to poke through and reveal your stitches later on.  You will want to double thread it for extra strength. Pull an eight-inch to one-foot section (20 to 30 cm) of thread through the eye of your needle.          Then, pull it until the ends meet and the needle is in the middle. Knot it several times at the ends. Test the knot by pulling it between two fingernails. The knot should be tight and strong. Snip off the threads below the knot. Leave about one cm (0.4 in) of thread remaining.  Pull it up through the machine stitch and ensure the knot is secure and hidden between the folds of the project before continuing.  Make sure they are perfectly matched at the point where the machine stitch stopped. Think of the two folds as the right and the left side of “the ladder” the makes the stitch.  It is important to always insert the needle through the inside edge of the fabric, where the hem was folded inward. It ensures that your stitch is hidden within the fold, rather than showing on the outside edge of the fabric.  Pull it through the center.  Pull it through toward the center. , Stitch into it to connect the stitches on either side.  The thread should close your stitch and hide the ladder stitch you just made within the fold of the hem. Pinch the thread and fabric where it emerges so that you don’t lose any of the tension before you secure the stitch.  Thread your needle through the loop and pull it taut.          Repeat several times to secure it.  Tuck the ends into the fold.	Ensure your project is turned right side out. Smooth out the project. Fold the hem of the opening inward. Pin the opening closed. Thread your needle. Insert your needle inside the opening, continuing where the machine stitch ended. Pinch the folds together. Insert your needle through the right side of the fold. Make a one half to one cm (0.2 to 0.4 in) stitch into the inside fold on the right side. Make a small, equal stitch through the inside fold on the left side. Alternate right and left stitches to form your steps up a “ladder.”        , Continue until you reach the end of the machine stitch on the other side of the fabric. Pull the thread taut when you reach the end of your open section. Knot the end of the thread by bringing your needle through the inside stitches and looping it. Cut the end of the thread close to the fabric.Done
Before you begin flipping your way through your favorite recipe books, you should first take some time to consider the food allergies that your partner may have. You wouldn’t want to spend the time making a delicate peanut butter pie for dessert only to remember that your partner is allergic to peanuts. Make a list of the food allergies your partner has, if any, and cross check any recipe you are considering with that list.   You should also consider your partner’s dietary preferences. Cooking a steak dinner might not go over very well with a vegan girlfriend. You could also consider foods that you know your partner loves and try to work these foods into your menu.; , When considering what to cook, stick to dishes that you have tried before. Testing out a new souffle recipe on your loved one may result in a disastrous (but potentially memorable) meal. Choosing a simple meal can make the whole process a bit less stressful; there is nothing wrong with breaking out your family’s favorite fettuccine alfredo recipe for this special occasion.   Consider meals that you have cooked in the past that are simple to make but look fancy. Or, think about making a variation of a meal that you have not tried that you feel confident you can prepare well. You could also browse the internet or search wikiHow for recipes that are rated well and that seem to be in accordance with your skill level. Some recipes you may like to try include: Filet mignon, risotto, shrimp scampi, salad nicoise and French macarons (for dessert)   , If you are planning on serving several courses, try to pick out courses the compliment each other. Once you have picked out your main dish, consider selecting an appetizer(s) and dessert to accompany the main course. Consider the ingredients that you will be using in your main dish, and then try to find appetizers and desserts that pair well.   In general, you may want to try to stick to one type of cuisine. For example, if you are thinking about preparing fettuccine alfredo with chicken and vegetables for your main course, you may want to browse Italian appetizers and desserts. You could consider starting out the meal with a caprese salad, or melon wrapped in prosciutto (both of which are easy to prepare even if you have not made them before), and ending the night with Italian gelato and fresh fruit for dessert.  Once you have selected your dishes, consider creating a pretty menu that you can put on the table for your partner to look at when they sit down. Write down each course and consider writing the main ingredients of each dish below the name of the course, like you often see in restaurants.  If you are deciding between a couple of dishes, or are thinking about trying a recipe you have never tried before, you may want to try cooking them before your romantic evening if you have the time. Doing a test run can help you to figure out whether the dish will go over well.   Practicing the preparation of your meal will also help you to resolve any challenges you face during while cooking, such as overcooking or undercooking the meat, or leaving the noodles in the pot too long.  To create a romantic evening, try to avoid dishes that smell heavily of things that are not terribly romantic, like intense fish or fiery garlic. Leaning in for a kiss from your loved one could end up less than romantic if you both wreak of boiled broccoli.  Like smelly foods, foods that could upset your stomach should also be avoided if possible. Burping or passing gas in the middle of dinner could quickly kill the romantic mood if your partner is offended by that sort of thing. Of course, everyone reacts differently to different kinds of food, but in general the foods that cause the most gas include:   Beans and lentils. Vegetables like broccoli, peas, asparagus, and cauliflower. Fruits like peaches, apricots, raw apples, and pears. Milk and rich dairy products.  If you are the legal drinking age, consider pairing your meal with a nice bottle of wine. The wine you choose will depend on the kind of food you are eating. If you don’t like wine, or cannot legally buy it, consider making a fancy non-alcoholic beverage, like a Shirley Temple.   If you are considering wine, click here.  Once you have picked out the dishes you will be preparing, go shopping for supplies. The ingredients you select should be good quality and fresh. For example, if you are planning on cooking beef, select a nice cut. If possible, go shopping a day or two before your romantic meal.   Remember that the freshness of your ingredients could change the flavor of your meal, so always try to pick out the freshest items.  Your goal is to have everything ready at the same time. Try to aim for everything being ready to be put on the table about five minutes before you plan to eat. For example, if the rice needs to cook for an hour but the chicken only bakes for fifteen minutes, you'll need to start them at different times. To help plan out your cooking schedule:   Write down how long everything takes to cook and then begin cooking them in the order from longest time to shortest time. If you need to boil something, don’t forget to factor in the time it will take for the water to heat up to a boil (generally around 10 minutes). The same goes for heating up the oven (this will depend on your oven and the temperature you are heating it to).  If your timing is slightly off and one dish is done before the rest, try to keep it warm by placing the food in a covered container. You can also keep things warm by sticking them in the oven on a low temperature, but do not keep dishes in the oven for too long or they could dry out. You can also keep items you cooked on the stovetop warm by turning the heat to low.   Try to avoid relying on the microwave to warm things up if you can help it.  Everyone has a different opinion about how much salt is too much salt. Try to err on the side of too little salt, as this can always be remedied by adding more. Place a salt shaker on the table so that your partner can choose to add salt if he or she feels like it.  If you the food you are cooking is hot, consider putting it in serving dishes that will keep it warm until you are ready to eat. On the other hand, if your appetizers, or even your main dish, are cold, consider arranging them so that they look beautiful on the plate.   You could even put a flower on the plate next to the food to give the arrangement an extra touch.  Once you have finished cooking and everything is being kept warm or is already plated, try to wash up the dishes and kitchen as much as possible.   If you don’t have time, fill the sink with hot water after the scraping the plates and put the dishes in so that they will be easy to clean the next day.  Generally, you will want to try to do this before you begin cooking. Lay out a nice tablecloth and consider adding placemats where you will both be sitting. Try to match the plates and bowls, and lay out the necessary cutlery.   For example, if you are eating steak, make sure that each place setting has a steak knife to make cutting the meat easy.  Candles are a lovely touch that you can add to heighten the romantic feel of your dinner. Dim the lights and place candles in accent spots around the room and on your table.   Keep in mind, however, to try to use candles that do not have too strong of a scent. Candles that are heavily scented can interfere with the taste of your dinner. Stick to neutral, light smells, or unscented candles.  For an extra special dinner, place freshly cut flowers in a vase and put it on the table. However, try to keep the vase and flowers short so that they do not block your view of your loved one while you eat.   You can also get rose petals that you can sprinkle on the table, or place on your partner’s plate.  Play music that you both like, but put it on a low setting so that it does not interfere or distract from your conversation. Consider putting on music that does not rely heavily on lyrics, such as jazz, classical music, or spanish guitar.	Be aware of your partner’s allergies. Pick out a dish (or dishes) you know you can cook well. Decide how many courses you are going to serve. Write up a menu (optional). Consider testing out a couple of dishes before the big night. Try to avoid dishes with very strong odors. Try to avoid foods that might make you or your partner gassy. Plan out what you will drink with your meal. Pick out quality ingredients. Estimate how long it will take you to prepare each dish. Keep the courses warm. Limit the amount of salt you use. Arrange the food on the plate or place the food in serving dishes. Try to clean up as much as you can before your partner arrives. Set the table. Light some candles. Set out flowers or use rose petals. Put on some music.
An air-tight door though is not a very recent or novel concept, its importance has enhanced due to the changes in the environmental conditions. With growing noise and air pollution becoming a regular part of our daily life, an air-tight door can also reduce noise levels.  As already stated above, an air-tight door can prevent dust and smoke from coming in, and can serve as an air trap. Some other uses are as follows:  Thermal insulation: Air-tight doors are ideal thermal insulators for any room because they do not let the outside prevailing temperature affect the inside temperature. Water penetration: Using air-tight doors can stop water from entering, thereby preventing many common problems arising due to the penetration of water, such as mold, fungus, insects, etc. Acoustic silencing: The peace usually needed for concentration and sleep can be marred by the growing amount of noise in the atmosphere, finding its way into our rooms even though the normal doors are shut. When the doors are air-tight, once the door is closed, nothing can hamper the peace and work can progress in a very silent manner. Smoke and air resistant: Air-tight doors have the ability to resist smoke and air from outsides and help maintain freshness inside.   Use to keep air-conditioning constant inside, so use in rooms that receive the benefits of cooling or heating that is circulated; this will help to keep an even temperature maintained Use for the study, for a work-from-home space, for bedrooms Use to keep the noise of the games room or playroom from the rest of the house!	Consider whether an air-tight door is suitable for your needs. Understand what air-tight doors can provide for your home. Consider where it is best to place air-tight doors in your home.
Fill a large pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a heat-safe glass container inside the large pot. The top of the glass container should be above the water level.          If you have a metal beaker used for candle-making, you can use this instead of the glass container.; , If you don't remove the wrapper, you will end up with a soggy mess. Here are a few easy ways to remove crayon wrappers:          Peel and tear the wrapper off. Start at one end (top or bottom) and the seam of the wrapper. Nick your fingernail under the wrapper, and start tearing it off. If the wrappers are difficult to remove, run a craft knife down the length of a crayon and gently cut the wrapper open. Peel the wrapper off.Soak the crayon in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes. The water will soften the paper and make it easier to remove.Some crayons have very loose wrappers that are not glued on. You might be able to slide these off like a sock or a paper wrapper off a straw.  If you have a bunch of crayons in different colors, you can sort them by color. This will save you time later when you are melting the crayons. You do not have to group specific colors together, such as putting all of the "periwinkle" blues together and the "royal" blues together. Instead, just group all of the blues together, all of the yellows together, and so forth.  You want the pieces to be about ½ inches (1.27 centimeters) long.This will help them melt quicker and reduce the number of lumps that might form.  Once the water starts boiling, lower the temperature and keep the water at a steady simmer.  Do not put all of the colors in all at once, or you will get a murky brown color. Instead, drop the crayons in based on color. If you sorted the colors out beforehand, you can just drop the color piles into the container.          If you are making crayon candles, then add some shaved candle wax and a few drops of essential oil or candle fragrance.If you are making crayon-based lipstick, then you will need to start with one crayon (you can use one color, or different colors amounting to one crayon) and ½ teaspoon of shea butter, and ½ teaspoon of oil, such as almond oil, Argan oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, or olive oil.If you want to add any extras, such as glitter, fragrance, or essential oil, now is the time to do so.  Stir them occasionally with a spoon so that everything gets heated evenly. Do not leave the stove unattended and be sure to use good ventilation; the fumes given off by the melting wax can cause headaches.         If the water level in the big pot starts to get too low, add more water.  The glass container will be very hot, so be sure to use an oven mitt or pot holder to protect your hand. You can pour the hot wax into silicone ice cube molds or candy molds to make fun-shaped crayons. You can also use this wax to make crayon-based lipstick or candles.	Assemble a double boiler or bain marie. Peel the wrappers off of the crayons. Consider separating the crayons by color. Cut the crayons into smaller pieces using a craft knife or a kitchen knife. Turn on the stove and bring the water to a boil. Drop the crayon pieces into the glass container. Wait until the crayons are melted. Take the container out of the water and use the wax.
Most plants benefit from a seedling stage. It provides them with the opportunity to grow in optimal conditions.; , If you are raising seedlings from seed, make sure that the seeds are fresh and healthy. This ensures that the seedlings get an excellent start in life.  Don't reuse seed-raising mix; that risks transferring plant diseases that can decimate your seedlings.  This means:   Wash and sterilise all pots, planters, trays, etc. to be used unless they are new biodegradable trays (these can be obtained at nursery stores for a very low cost) Wash down benches where you are handling the seedlings Wash your own hands!	Decide whether or not the plant is best raised as a seedling first. Grow from healthy seed. Use fresh seed-raising mix every time. Clean everything that is to be used for raising seedlings.
The dynamic of driving in reverse is quite different than that of normal driving because the wheels you turn to steer are at the front of the car. As you back up, make small adjustments by turning the wheel in the direction you want the back of the car to turn toward.Turning the wheel to the left as you back up will cause the back of the car to go left and vice versa. Stop the car if you feel uneasy about the direction it is heading, then set off again once you’ve gained control.  As you turn the vehicle, the front end of the car will swing in the opposite direction the back end is turning. Check the area around the front of the car frequently as you back up slowly to ensure you don’t hit or run over anything with the front wheels.If you are turning left as you back up, the front of the car will swing to the right, and vice versa. Make sure you are going slowly enough that you can check the front of the car for clearance without hitting anything.  If you are backing up a hill or need to turn, you may need to utilize the gas pedal occasionally while backing up. Once your right foot is completely off of the brake, move it over the gas pedal to the right of the brake. Press down on the pedal slowly to control the amount of speed you pick up as you back up.Make subtle adjustments to your speed by applying pressure to the gas pedal. Bring your foot back to the brake once you have gained sufficient speed or if you need to slow back down.  If you need to turn around an obstacle while backing up, you may want to use both hands to manipulate the steering wheel. Using one hand, you can usually only turn the wheel up to ninety degrees in each direction, so if you need to take a steeper turn, using both hands may help. Make sure that you can still see behind you as you place your right hand back on the wheel if you need to.Never cross your hands over one another while turning the wheel. Instead push the wheel with one hand and pull it with the other.  Backing up can feel quite different than driving forward, and your view is often compromised by the back of the car and a limited view out of your window. Do not hurry yourself while backing up and instead take your time to prevent accidents.Never drive your vehicle in a manner that feels unsafe. Feel free to stop the vehicle and take a minute if you feel uncertain about what you’re doing.  When you’ve backed up far enough, press your foot back down on the brake pedal gradually to come to a smooth stop. Be careful not to apply too much pressure too quickly, or you will stop the vehicle abruptly.Use only your right foot to apply the brakes in your vehicle. Keep your foot pressed on the brake once the vehicle has stopped.  With your foot firmly on the brake pedal, press the button the shift lever in automatic vehicles and press it forward until it is aligned with the “P” that indicates that it is in park. In standard transmission equipped vehicles, simply take the shift lever out of gear (in neutral) and apply the parking brake by pulling up on the handle or pressing down on the pedal.If you are unsure where to locate your parking brake or how to engage it, refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance.	Turn the wheel in the direction you want the back of the car to turn. Check the clearance of the front end. Transition your right foot to the gas pedal if needed. Use two hands to steer when turning. Never go faster than you feel comfortable controlling. Press the brake with your right foot firmly to stop. Put the vehicle in park or set the parking brake when you’re done.
The trench will need to be dug down to the footers of the foundation and be about 4' wide. You will also need to dig a trench away from the foundation to either a percolation trench, dry well or to daylight if the slope of the land allows. (Percolation trench is also called an infiltration trench similar to the trench you have around the foundation. You will then add perforated pipe at the percolation trench. This is the best way to manage the run off. A dry well is either a pit filled with crushed stone or a structural camber. The easiest way is running it to daylight if the building site has a steep enough slope.); , Along the bottom of the trench, you will unroll the filter fabric, lapping the filter fabric up the sidewalls of the foundation. Smooth the remaining fabric away from the foundation.  Cover the filter fabric with a 3-4” layer of crushed stone. Now, install the 4” perforated pipe around the whole perimeter of the foundation. Perforated pipe can be installed on level ground. Use a solid 4” PVC tee to connect the ends of the perforated pipe. You will now connect the solid 4”PVC pipe to the tee, which will leads to a percolation trench, dry well or to daylight. Cover the pipe with crushed stone, 8-10” above the footing of the foundation. Then, pull the excess filter fabric over the crushed stone, making sure it laps against the foundation. It is important that the fabric completely cover the crushed stone, this will prevent the soil clogging the pipe.  Fill with a minimum of 6” of gravel or coarse sand is recommended to prevent soil getting under the fabric and clogging the drainage system. Now back fill the trenches. The soil should slop away from the foundation.  You have your drainage system almost completed. Lay a layer of filter fabric over the soil. Plant your favorite shrubs and cover filter fabric with bark mulch or pea stone. Not only will you have a dry basement, you will have lovely landscaping.	Dig a trench around the perimeter of the foundation. Lay the filter fabric. Layer crushed stone and pipe. Cover with gravel. Landscape.
You should plug a lamp (test it first) into the outlet that you intend to change and then turn off the circuit breaker to make the lamp go off. If the device isn't working, find a different method to determine the power is off.          If the outlet doesn't function at all, and you are not sure which breaker turns it off, then you may want to turn off the main breaker. This will shut down the entire house, but it is better to be safe than to risk electric shock. A voltage detector ("power sniffer") is also useful for detecting voltage. The light fixtures are usually on the lower value amp circuit breakers (usually 15 amps). If you leave the light fixtures on, it gives you better lighting to work on the plugs and switches. Standard outlets are usually connected to 15 and 20 amp circuits breakers. If the outlet in the room isn't protected by circuit breakers, but by fuses, make sure that fuse has been removed.  Traditional outlet plates usually have one screw per outlet (but some - including GFCIs - have two) and switch plates two per switch. There may be multiple switches or outlets in one box, but you can replace just one if needed.          If you need to replace more than one, work on each one at a time so that you do not confuse the wiring. Make a diagram (or take close-up digital photos) to have a clear record of how it looked before you disconnected anything.  These hold the switch/outlet to the electrical box. Remove these two screws and gently pull the switch or outlet out.  Use the same mark for each wire connected to the same terminal screw of the device.          The "hot" (usually black or red) wires should be connected to the side that the shorter plug slot is on and generally have gold colored screws. The "neutral" white wires should be connected to the side that the taller plug slot is on and generally have silver screws. The bare-copper or green wire will connect to the green ground screw attached to one of the outlet mounting brackets. There may be one, two or more sets of wires connected to your outlet, depending on its location in the circuit. It does not matter which wire of a colored pair goes to which screw unless the outlet is controlled by a switch.; , Use a screw driver to open the screws until you feel you might have room enough to pull the wires on, so don't open them too much.  Make sure that the wires wrap around the screw completely without touching the plastic edges and without breaking off the tip of the wires themselves. Pull the wires around each of these screws until they are seated and won't disconnect if accidentally pushed backwards.  Tighten them until they are tight and the wires are touching the metal piece on the side of the outlet behind the screws.  Make sure that the top screw tab is in line with their respective holes. ,, Use an small electrical appliance or one that won't draw too much power (such as a television set, computer system or mobile device), but be careful as open areas are now live. A better way to test an outlet is to use an electrical outlet tester. These can be purchased at your local hardware store, and usually cost between five and ten dollars.          If the outlet tester reads "open ground", connect the grounding wire (green or bare) to the green grounding screw. If your home does not have grounding wires, you should replace the outlet with either a two-prong outlet or a GFCI outlet. If the outlet tester reads "open hot", connect the hot wire (red or black, unless re-identified) to the hot screw. If the outlet tester reads "open neutral", connect the neutral wire (white) to the neutral screw. If the outlet tester reads "hot/neutral reverse", switch the positions of the hot and neutral wires on the outlet. If the outlet tester reads "hot/ground reverse", switch the positions of the hot and ground wires on the outlet. , Label the wires with some sort of identifying mark on masking tape wrapped around each wire. Use the same mark for each wire connected to the same terminal screw of the device. #* Look for an indication of "LINE" and "LOAD" on the body of the plug near the terminals. Each LINE and LOAD side has a gold and silver screw. It is very important to pay attention to this detail.  Power source hot (most likely black or red) must connect to the LINE gold screw. Power source neutral (most likely white from the SAME cable carrying the power source hot) must connect to the LINE silver screw.   A GFCI receptacle can provide "downstream" protection to other receptacles. For example, a GFCI in a kitchen may protect one or more other kitchen receptacles. If you have other "downstream" devices that are wired so that they are protected by the GFCI receptacle, there will be another cable(s) in the box. The cable(s) that feed the protected downstream plugs must be connected to the LOAD gold and silver terminals, and also the ground (green) terminal. If you connect any of these wires incorrectly, you will lose ground fault protection and/or damage the device.  Some devices should not be connected to GFCI receptacles because of the possibility for "nuisance tripping"; for example, refrigerators, fluorescent lights, laser printers, garbage disposals, trash compactors, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, home heating and cooling systems, artesian well and driven point jet type pumps,microwave ovens and freezers are some of the more commons items.   For switches:  Label the wires with some sort of identifying mark on masking tape wrapped around each wire. Use the same mark for each wire connected to the same terminal screw of the device Determine the type of switch you have. A single-pole switch (one switch controls the light fixture(s)) will have two screws and be marked "ON" and "OFF" if a toggle type, a 3-way switch (two switches control the light fixture(s), typically at each end of a stairwell) will have three screws, one of which is black, and a 4-way switch (three switches control the light fixture(s)) will have four screws, two of which are black. Both the 3-way and 4-way switches do not have "ON" and "OFF" markings. A "two pole" switch has four screws as well, but unlike the four way switch; has ON and OFF markings Do not confuse these two switches. You must use the same type of switch that you are replacing!    , Regardless of the way it was wired when you opened the box, electrical device (receptacles, switches, etc.) terminals are designed for one conductor per terminal.   Furthermore, outlets are not allowed to "complete" a circuit - this is sometimes called "daisy chaining". This means that you should not have to rely on the outlet to maintain power to the rest of the circuit. This is accomplished very easily by using wire nuts and "pigtails" (a 6 - 8 inch long piece of wire with stripped ends). Simply gather the wires that have the same identifying mark, and a "pigtail" and twist all of these wires together and secure them with a wire nut. Gently fold this wire nut bundle towards the back of the box, leaving the pigtail sticking out towards the front of the box. Put the same label on the end of the pigtail as those under the wirenut that you just put on. This is the new single wire that represents the group that was attached to the device when you started. Repeat this procedure for each wire with the same label. Obviously, if there are any wires that have unique labels, they should not be pigtailed, unless they are too short to easily connect to a terminal. After you have securely tightened the wires (wrap the wire clockwise around the screw, i.e., in the direction the screw turns as it tightens) to the new switch or outlet, gently push the wires back into the box and secure the outlet/switch to the electrical box. Inspect for damaged insulation / exposed conductors. Tape off exposed conductors. Do not wrap electrical tape over wire nut connections (the wire nut should stay on by itself if it is properly connected). Replace the cover and turn the electricity back on. Test the circuit to make sure it is functioning properly.	Make certain that the electricity is turned off to the circuit that you are working on. Remove the outlet or switch cover plate. Find the two screws, one at the top and one at the bottom. Label the wires with some sort of identifying mark on masking tape wrapped around each wire. Loosen the screws on the new electrical outlet/switch where the wires will be held. Connect the wires as was described in the step 1 of this "part"/subsection above. Tighten the screws, as you keep a firm hold on the outlet to ensure the wires don't slip. Push the electrical outlet back into the electric box. Screw the electrical outlet back into the box.         , Turn back on the power, using any method as described above, turning on the breakers or reinstalling the fuses.         , Test the outlet one more time. Remove the small electrical device and replace the outlet's cover plate.         , Make sure the following devices are connected to GFCI   For Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) receptacles (these have "Test" and "Reset" buttons and are required in bathrooms, garages, outdoors, and other locations within 6 feet of a water source, such as plugs serving counter top appliances near a sink in kitchens). Determine which devices are not connected to GFCI. Make sure to mark each wire in the box per device with a label, and have the new replacement devices to connect.
A “barre” is when you use the same fingering across more than one string.In this intermediate version of the chord, start by placing your first finger on the fifth A string at the second fret. Press it down it flat across to the first E string. All five strings should now be pressed down at the second fret.  Just as the previous method, put your second finger on the second B string at the third fret., This is different from the previous method in that you put your third finger on the fourth D string at the fourth fret. , You’re actually going to put your fourth pinky finger on the third G string at the fourth fret, right next to your third finger., For this intermediate version, you’re not going to play the sixth E string. Instead, start your pick or thumb on the fifth string and strum through to the first to play the chord. Do not include the sixth E string.	Barre your first finger. Place your second finger. Place your third finger. Place your fourth finger. Strum the chord.
Glass painting requires a little more than just paint and brushes. You will also need to prepare your glass piece properly, so that the paint will stick. Some paints also need to be cured in an oven. Here is a list of what you will need to get a basic painting done:   Glass object to paint Cotton balls Rubbing alcohol Design printed on paper Masking tape Glass paints Paint brushes Plate or palette Oven (optional); , You can paint things like jars, cups, or wine glasses. You can also paint a glass panel. The best place to get a glass panel is from a picture frame. When you are done painting, you can display the finished piece inside the frame. Make sure that the panel in the frame is glass, however; some frames come with an acrylic panel instead of glass.   You can take the back out of a picture frame, or leave it in. If you decide to leave the back in, you might want to cover it with some white paper. Most glass paint is translucent, so it will show up best against a white background.  Even if the glass looks clean, you will still want to wash it. Any oil, dirt, or dust may keep the paint from sticking to the surface.  It needs to be printed on paper. If you are painting something like a cup or jar, the paper needs to be trimmed down so that it can fit inside.   The best patterns to use are just outlines, like from a coloring book.  If you plan on using this glass piece for eating or drinking out of, move the pattern to a place where food, drink, or mouths won't be touching it. Even if a glass paint is labeled as "non-toxic," it may not be food-safe.If you are painting on a flat sheet of glass, place the pattern face down on the glass. Tape the edges down with masking tape, and flip the glass over. If you are painting on a cup, place the pattern inside the cup. Move it around until it is where you want it to be. Press the paper against the wall of the cup, and tape it in place. Keep borders in mind. If you are going to put the glass panel inside a frame, make sure that the frame won't be covering your design., Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol, and wipe down the entire surface of your glass piece. Any oily residue left on the glass from when you handled it may keep the paint from sticking.Try not to touch the area where the pattern is from now on.  You are doing this, because the first bit of paint often tends to gush out in a glob. It is better for this to happen on a sheet of paper than on your painting.   Some glass paint liners are labeled as "leading" or as "dimensional." Most glass liners come in black, but you might also find them in other colors as well, such as silver and gold.  Hold the tip just above the glass, and start tracing the design. Use long, continuous strokes. If you make short strokes, your lines are more likely to end up uneven and goopy. Also, try not to drag the tip on the glass. This will cause the paint to come out too thin and streaky.   If you are left-handed, try to start tracing from the right side first. If you are right-handed, start tracing from the left. This will help prevent you from accidentally smudging the wet outline while you work.  Once you have finished outlining your piece, look over it carefully. If you see any lumps or clumps, you can wipe them away with a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol. If the paint has dried, you can scratch it away with a craft knife., Most glass paint liners will take about six to eight hours to dry.You might want to refer to the label on the bottle for a more specific drying time, however, as each brand will be a little different.   If you are pressed for time, you can hold a fan or hairdryer over the paint. This will help it dry faster. If you are using a hair dryer, make sure that you are using the lowest setting., If your glass paint comes with a pointy tip, you can apply the paint to the glass directly from the bottle. You can also squirt the paint onto a pallet and apply it with a paintbrush; this will give you the most control.   You can use both synthetic and natural brushes for glass painting. Synthetic brushes may cost less, but they will be more likely to leave behind brush strokes. Brushes made from soft, natural fibers, may be more expensive, but they will leave behind the smoothest finish., Do not press down too hard with the brush, or you will wipe the existing paint off. Instead, let the brush glide across the surface that needs to be painted. If the paint is too thin in one area, wait until it dries before applying a second coat. If you try to go over wet paint a second time, you may end up wiping it off.Glass paint will shrink a little when it dries. Try to paint all the way to the outline. If you are having troubles reaching a tight area, such as a point or corner, use a toothpick to spread the paint.The thicker you lay the paint on, the more it will level off. This reduces brush strokes.To create a swirled, marbled effect, put a few drops of two or more colors into the space you want colored. Use a toothpick to lightly swirl the colors together. Do not over-mix, or you may lose the swirled effect and end up with a solid color., When you are ready to move on to a new color, dip the brush in water and swirl it about to remove any excess paint. Lightly dab the brush against a paper towel. If you see any color on the towel, rinse the brush again. If you don't see any color, keep tapping the brush until there's no water left on the bristles. If water gets into the paints, it can cause beading., Look over your piece carefully, and see if there are any places that need touching up. It is much easier to touch things up while the paint is still wet than when it is dry. Use Q-tips, paintbrushes, and toothpicks dipped in rubbing alcohol to wipe away any excess paint. This is especially useful if you went outside the lines.Use a pin or needle to pierce any bubbles that may have formed in the paint. Be sure to do this while the paint is still wet.  Some brands of paint need to dry for several days before they can be used, while others need to dry for up to a month. Some brands might require you to bake your piece in the oven. Always refer to the label on your bottle of paint.Some labels will tell you to "cure" your paint for a certain amount of time. This simply means to let the paint "dry."  , Depending on the brand of paint you used, however, the paint may not be cured all the way. If the paint feels sticky or gummy, it is not cured and needs to dry longer.   Most glass paints will be completely cured after 21 days.  This will allow you to wash your piece in the dishwasher. Place your painted piece onto a foil-covered baking sheet, then put the baking sheet into a cold oven. Set the oven to 350°F (175°C), or whatever temperature the manufacturer recommends. Bake the item for about 30 minutes, then turn the oven off. Do not take the piece out of the oven yet. Instead, let the piece and the oven both cool down first. Removing the glass too soon may cause it to crack.   Most paint with glitter in it cannot be cured in the oven. You must allow them to air-cure for 21 days. The label on the bottle will tell you whether or not the paint can be oven-cured.If you are using glass paints from different brands, know that they may have different curing temperatures and times. To avoid burning the paint, stick with the lower baking temperature and time., Most glass paints are delicate after they cure, and should only be hand-washed using a soft cloth of sponge. If you cured your piece in the oven, you might be able to wash it in the top rack of a dishwasher. Never leave painted glass sitting in water, even if you oven-cured it. The water will cause the paint to flake away. Also, never use a scratchy sponge on a glass piece; you will scrape the paint off.	Gather your supplies. Find a glass piece to paint. Clean the glass with some soap and water. Have your pattern or design ready. Place the pattern where you want it to be. Wipe the surface of the glass down with rubbing alcohol. Get some glass paint liner and squeeze a tiny amount out onto a sheet of paper. Use a glass paint liner or dimensional glass paint to trace the outlines on your pattern. Make any touchups, if necessary, when you are done. Let the outline dry all the way. Squirt some glass paint onto a pallet or plate. Fill in the spaces with glass paint. Be sure to rinse and dry your brush before moving onto a different color. Clean your painting up again, if needed. Read the instructions on the paint bottle. Allow the paint to dry for at least 48 hours.After this, the paint should be dry to the touch, and can be gently handled. Consider baking the item for durable finish. Know how to wash your glass piece safely. Finished.

Because you have chosen to knit a baby hat, you will more than likely select a baby yarn.          Consider buying extra-soft baby yarn, but know that you do not have to buy a yarn that is specifically made for babies. Know what yarn weight you need. Most baby items are made from lighter weight yarn, either “superfine” (1) or “fine” (2). ; , Remember that not all parents want pink for a girl or blue for a boy. Consider a gender neutral color or primary color.          Consider choosing a variegated baby yarn instead of a solid color. There are also some new yarns that form a pattern as you knit.  Many baby hat patterns require size 6 (4mm) needles.          Start with straight needles if you are just beginning to knit. Circular needles are generally used by more advanced knitters. Determine how big your needles need to be. The needle size determines how big the loops are in your hat, and the wrong needles may lead to the hat being the wrong size. Note that there are metric and US sizes, so you may need to convert the size. , Casting on is the way that you begin your knitting by creating a row of loops on one of your needles. See How to Knit for step-by-step instructions for casting on.          Cast on 60 loops (if using 4mm needles) (more if the hat is not for a newborn). Hold your needles so that the left needle has the knitting on it, the needle points are facing away from you, and the yarn is leaving the needle to the right, on the bottom side of the needle.  This will probably be about 50 rows if you’re using a fine baby yarn.          Hold the needle with the cast-on loops in your left hand and pass the needle in your right hand through the stitch and behind your left needle. Wrap a loop of yarn counter-clockwise around the right needle point. Pull the right needle off through the stitch on the left side, and push the top stitch off of the left needle. Each knit stitch will add one loop to the needle on the right and remove one from the needle on the left. When you finish a row, change the needles to your other hands so that you start each row with the knitting on the left needle. Be sure your knitting trails to the right as you are knitting, towards the (at first) empty needle.  After knitting for about 5 inches, begin to decrease the length of your knitting.         Instead of going through one stitch with your right needle, go through two stitches. Continue the 2-stitch decrease until you have only one loop left on your needle.  Be sure to leave yourself a nice long tail of yarn for sewing the sides of the hat together. Tie the tail in a simple knot where it leaves the knitting before you begin to stitch with it.  Use a large sewing needle or a bobby pin, sew the hat sides together. Weave the excess yarn in and out along the two sides. Tie off the end and cut off the remaining tail.  The stitched seam should be on the inside, where it won’t be seen.  Wrap it nicely or include it in a display that includes other practical baby items, such as on top of a “diaper cake.”	Select the type of yarn. Decide what color of yarn you prefer. Select the right needles. Cast on your knitting. Knit a 5 inch swath using a basic knit stitch. Taper off for the top of the hat. Cut off your extra yarn. Sew the hat together. Flip your hat inside out. Decide how you want to give your hat as a gift.
Keep food in covered containers and utensils clean. Discard any food that has come in contact with flood water, been at room temperature for more than two hours, or that has an unusual odor, color, or texture. Also discard foods from cans that are swollen, dented, or corroded, even though the product may look safe to eat.   Thawed food usually can be eaten if it is still “refrigerator cold.” It can be re-frozen if it still contains ice crystals. To be safe, remember, “When in doubt, throw it out.”  , Alternative cooking sources in times of emergency include candle warmers, chafing dishes, fondue pots, or a fireplace. Although canned food can be eaten out of the can without warming, you can heat the contents by removing the label, thoroughly washing and disinfecting the can (use a diluted solution of one part bleach to 10 parts water), and opening the can before heating.  If the weather is cold enough, set food outside, perhaps in a hole in the ground or buried in the snow. Or, use dry ice. 25 pounds of dry ice will keep a 10-cubic-foot freezer below freezing for 3-4 days. Use care when handling dry ice, and wear dry, heavy gloves to avoid injury.  Do not allow garbage to accumulate inside, both for fire and sanitation reasons. ,	Understand that sanitation is vital so that germs do not spread via contaminated cookware or food. Cook food using the available implements. Look for alternative storage space for perishable food if you are without power for a long time. Keep garbage in closed containers and dispose outside, burying if necessary. Keep your hands clean by washing them frequently with soap and water that has been boiled or disinfected.  , Use only pre-prepared canned baby formula for infants and avoid using powdered formulas with treated water.
Most yarn comes in a skein that is not convenient to knit from, so your first step before starting to knit should be to make a yarn ball.	Make your yarn ball.
Remember, the 5th string is the the second highest string from the top, or the A string. Place your middle finger just to the left of the second fret (for right-handed guitarists), as near to the fret as possible so that you get a clean, clear tone.       ; , Your ring finger simply goes right underneath your middle, holding the second fret on the D string. This is the third string from the top. Again, keep your finger near that second fret, but still on the head-side of the guitar.          The head of the guitar is the small piece at the end of the neck with the tuning knobs.  All an E-minor chord requires are those two strings and two frets. Make sure you use the tips of your fingers on the frets so that you don't accidentally mute the lower strings -- you want them free to ring out.  The Em chord uses every string on the guitar, so you can strum away freely. However, for a deeper, darker sound, limit yourself to just the top four strings or so. For a lighter sound, like in many ska and reggae songs, just play the bottom 3-4 strings.  If you already know how to play an E-major chord, you can get to the Em by simply lifting your index finger off the first fret. Your final chord will look like:          --0-- --0-- --0-- --2-- --2-- --0--	Place your middle finger on the 5th string, second fret. Place your ring finger on the 4th string, second fret. Leave the other strings open. Strum all the strings at once. Alternatively, remove your index finger from an E major chord to get to the Em instantly.
Boat licensing is done on a state level and you will need to research your state's requirements. Every state will have some variance in the requirements that will need to be met. Try doing some research into your state's requirements to learn more about what you need to do to obtain your license.You can try looking at the DMV's website http://www.dmv.org/boat-registration.php  Some states have exceptions for vessels without motors. You may not need to have a license or register something like a canoe or kayak.Other states may not require any licenses at all.; , Many states will offer both on-line and in person classes. Both types of classes will allow you to obtain your boating license in the same way. Picking the right learning environment for your needs can help you successfully get your boating license.   Online courses provide lectures and tests in the same way in-class lectures do.You can check for online classes at http://www.boaterexam.com/  Your state will have their own website for in-person classes., In order to enroll in a boating license course, you will need to pay the course fee. The exact fee will vary between states. You will need to do some research into what the fee is for your own state or on-line course to learn more.   For example, New York state generally charges around $10.00 per course.Some online courses are $29.95 Some online courses only charge you when you pass the exam., Parts of the boating exam will test how much you know about boating safety. These topics will allow you to demonstrate that you can keep your boat in working order, make sure you are prepared for emergencies, and ensure that you can operate your boat correctly. Expect some of these questions to appear on the test:Where should you place a fire extinguisher on your boat? What should you do in case of a fire? Which boats are most likely to capsize?  , There are many rules and practices that you and other boaters should be aware of. These rules will help make sure everyone is kept safe while boating, preventing any needless accidents from occurring. You can expect to find questions like these on the exam:What should a power boat approaching a sail boat in darkness do? Which direction does bad weather usually approach from? What side of your boat should you pass red markers on? What area is indicated by red and green buoys? Which side of the boat is the port side?  , Although boating is a lot of fun, it can also present some dangers. It's important that you know how to keep you and your friends safe while out on the water. You will likely see some questions that are similar to these on the test:What are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning? What are the symptoms of hypothermia? How can you help someone recover from hypothermia? What is the H.E.L.P. position?  , Before you take your boating license test, it can be a good idea to get in some practice. There are a few options on-line that you can use to get a better understanding of what's on the test. Take some time to look over the practice exams to increase your chances of passing the exam.You can find a practice exam here http://www.boaterexam.com/canada/practice/quiz.aspx   , When you sign up to take a boating license exam, you will likely be given material to study.

If rioting is imminent, secure your home and business. Rioting often brings looting, and looters can pillage and destroy your property. Make sure your doors are locked, and board up all your windows. Remove small valuables to a safer place if possible, since determined rioters will get in just about anywhere.  First-floor windows are more vulnerable than others, and doors without deadbolts are less secure. It’s possible that civil unrest incidents can spill over to other areas, such as your house, and you need to ensure that you have adequate locks on all of your doors and windows., It is important to know local laws governing self defense, no matter how you plan to defend yourself and your home. You don’t want to find yourself in trouble after the unrest has been controlled because you violated the law. This is equally important if you are in another city, state, or country.   You’ll want to learn federal, state, county, and city laws that apply to your address.	Secure your home. Check your locks and windows. Know the law.
The less attention you draw to yourself the better.If possible, pick up attire similar to what the crew is dressed in so you look like you belong.  If you start freaking out and talking about how excited you are to see the band, people will begin to catch on. Play it cool. You can try to look busy or bored. If you want to fit in, it should seem like it's just another day at the office for you.   Talk like you belong. If a crew member walks by, casually say hello. A simple nod works well, too. Don't overdo it and end up drawing their attention. If they stop you and question you, laugh it off. Then tell them you work at the venue, or you're with the band. Make eye contact. Don't hang your head down or try to stay unnoticed. The more you act like you aren't doing anything wrong, the better the chance you have.  Don't stop or slow down too much. Keep moving like you know where you're going, even if you don't. Watch where the staff and band members go and observe what they do. Pick up on it and follow like you belong there. By watching enough people, you'll figure out how to blend in and seem inconspicuous.	Wear dark, casual clothing. Act natural. Head to your destination.
Virtually any type of stone will work well for this project, so focus more on its condition, rather than what type it is. Favor those with smooth, rounded surfaces. Avoid chipped, broken, or jagged ones.Don’t limit yourself to stones with “perfect” shapes, like exact circles. Be on the lookout for oddly shaped stones that suggest designs uniquely suited to them, like a snowman or the Cheshire cat from Alice in Wonderland. Waterways are ideal places to find stones that have been worn smooth by currents. However, be careful about where you look, since public parks may forbid removing them. If you can’t find any available in the great outdoors, visit a local craft or gardening store, which often carry them.; , Expect paint brushes to wear out pretty fast when used on something as rough and hard as a stone. Save your money and leave expensive sets on the shelf. Buy a cheap set that offers a variety of sizes.If not already included in the set, also buy some wide, flat brushes to paint your background (or any other element covering a large surface area) in addition to the smaller brushes for your detail work. A paint palette is also advised if you're going to be using lots of different paints and shades, rather than just one or two colors. The longer the bristles, the better, since these will hold more paint and last longer.  If you are painting stones to add a touch of color to your garden or lawn, expect them to suffer more abuse over time from the sun and weather. Choose the right materials for the job. Favor paints designed specifically for exterior use. Then seal them with a spar urethane sealer for more protection from the elements., If, on the other hand, your plan is to bring the outdoors in and raid your garden for stones to paint and place inside your home, use any acrylic, craft, or water-based paint. Then apply a coat of Mod Podge or acrylic spray for a sealant.Of course, there's no harm in using materials meant for exterior use here. So if you have some handy, feel free to use them instead.  This step isn't strictly necessary, so feel free to skip it if you're just looking to have fun and aren't too concerned about the finished product. However, if you prefer perfection, practice your design on a sketchpad. Then use tracing paper to copy it, which you can then use to trace the outline on your stone. Additionally, expect the stone's natural shade to possibly affect the paint's color after drying, so dab your paints on a test stone with a similar shade to see what happens., If you’re using stones that you found outside, wash them first. Don’t worry about special cleaners. Just wash them in warm water and soap to remove any dirt that might muck up your paint or stick to your bristles. Rinse them off with more water and then either let them air-dry, pat them down with a towel, and/or use a hair dryer to get rid of the moisture.Store-bought stones should be relatively clean and ready to go, but washing them to get rid of any dust won’t hurt either.  Use a wide flat brush to apply your background color with minimal effort. Start your first coat on whichever side you choose: the back of the stone or its face. Let it dry completely before flipping the stone over and painting the other side. Once that side has dried, repeat the process with a second coat to minimize any alteration in color that the stone’s natural color may cause by bleeding through the paint. Expect drying times to vary depending on temperature, humidity, the type of paint used, and how much.When flipping the stone over to paint a new side, make sure any paint that may have dripped onto your dropcloth has dried as well. If necessary, replace your worktable’s protective covering with a fresh one.  If you’re going to paint your rock freehanded, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, use a pencil or fine-point marker to copy your design onto the stone (or, if you’re simply painting a bunch of squares in various colors, you can use painter’s tape to outline the first to be painted). For now, only worry about copying the largest elements. Leave the smaller elements for later, since anything you trace now may end up being covered by your next coat of paint. For instance:Let’s say you’re painting Lisa Simpson’s face onto a blue background. For the moment, just trace the outline of her head (minus her eyes) as a single shape. Leave out her lips, inner ear, eyelashes, eyeballs, and pupils until later.  Always color these in before moving on to smaller details. Avoid the risk of painting over your detail work, which could easily happen if you save the largest areas for last. Depending on how large or small your stone is, choose between a wide flat brush or a thick round one. Let the paint dry completely before moving on to smaller elements or fine detail work.Again, let’s say you’re painting Lisa Simpson. For now, simply fill the outline of her head with yellow paint.  Once your last coat of paint has dried completely, repeat with smaller elements. Always work from biggest to smallest, letting one set of elements dry completely before moving on to the next smallest. If you’re less sure of your painting skills when it comes to extremely fine lines, consider using variously colored fine-point markers or marker paints instead of a brush and paint.With Lisa Simpson, move onto her eyeballs next, since these are the second largest elements after her head. Paint them white and let them dry. Doing so once the yellow has dried helps prevent the two colors from mixing accidentally. Once the white paint dries, proceed to add her lips, inner ear, eyelashes, and pupils, as well as a fine black border around each feature.  Protect your artwork from wear, tear, and moisture. Add or one two coats of sealant. Be sure to read the directions for the particular sealant you choose, since some may recommend only using outdoors and/or with a ventilator mask in order to prevent inhalation of hazardous fumes.Once the sealant has dried, feel free to glue any add-ons (like pipe cleaners for whiskers, googly eyes, or bows) to the surface, if desired.  Almost any sort of container can be used for this. Just be sure there aren’t any holes in its bottom or sides so cement doesn’t leak out. If necessary, trim the sides so they’re only a little higher than the stone you intend to make for easier access to the cement once it’s poured inside.Possible molds include metal baking pans, plastic bowls, buckets, or containers, or even paper milk cartons cut to size.  Depending on how large you wish to make your stone, the amount needed will vary. However, let’s saying you’re making two stones using a couple of standard-size loaf pans as molds. For this, measure about 2.5 lbs (0.9 kg) into a plastic bucket. Then pour 1 cup (237 ml) of water into the mix. Stir to combine until all of the cement mix has been moistened.The directions to your particular brand of mix may advise a different ratio. However, for this project you only need enough water to get all of the cement moist, rather than make a wet soup like you see in the movies.  First, spray the inside of your mold with cooking oil to lubricate the sides for easier removal. Then pour the cement in as evenly as possible. Once it’s filled, lightly rap the mold’s bottom on a hard surface a couple of times, which will help any trapped reach the surface and escape. Then smooth the surface with a spade or even just your hand., Consider adding other elements in addition to (or instead of) painting your stone. Set mosaic tiles into the surface immediately after filling the mold, while the cement is still wet. Wait 30 or 40 minutes after filling, and then use stepping stone stamps to press names, words, or numbers into the cement's surface, like your family name or street number., Keep watch over your stone for the first hour after filling the mold. Pat the surface dry with paper towels if any water is forced to the surface as the cement dries. After that, simply let it sit for 24 hours. Then flip the mold upside down over a soft surface and whack the bottom until the stone falls out.	Choose smooth stones. Use cheap brushes. Buy the right paint and sealant for outdoor stones. Do the same for indoor stones. Sketch your design and practice on test stones. Clean your stone. Paint your background first. Trace your outline. Paint large areas in first. Add smaller elements and detail. Apply sealant. Choose your mold. Combine cement mix with water. Fill your mold. Decorate the surface, if desired. Let it dry for a day.
Make beds with plants that like natural mulch near the trees in your yard that shed leaves. When there are leaves on the ground, run them over once with a mower. Then rake them right into the beds.For your bed, consider shrubs, garlic, roses, and tender perennials.; , Several inches of leaf layer is natural and even an ecosystem. Wildlife like salamanders, turtles, chipmunks, and other species survive on such mini habitats.Leaf litter also provides an overwintering shelter for beneficial insects and earthworms. However, if thick piles of leaves are smothering your lawn, you may want to break them down, if not collect them.Consider collecting the leaves if they cover over a third of your yard and you can’t see the top of the grass blades.You may need to collect the leaves if you have a Home Owners Association that has specific requirements about autumn cleanup. If you decide to collect them, don’t try to do a whole season of leaf pickup in a single day. Plan leaf cleanup for several days in the autumn season., You may want to separate pine shedding from deciduous leaves. Pine needles are acidic, and there are certain plants that like acidic soil – and others that don’t. Therefore it’s beneficial to separate the pine needles to use as their own separate mulch.Rake the needles as soon as you notice them on the ground, since they usually fall before leaves do. Pack the pine needles in garbage bags and store them in a dry place. Use them when you need acidic mulch.  Wet leaves will form a more stable pile, but they are also heavier to rake.Choose dry weather if you want to use a leaf vacuum, as wet leaves can clog the vacuum.Don’t rake wet leaves if you have allergies, as mold and mildew in wet leaves can upset your sinuses.  You can choose to do this before or during leaf cleanup. Gather up the sticks in your yard and put them aside in a pile. Consider keeping the brush pile there as a shelter for birds, chipmunks and other wildlife. You can also set sticks aside for use as fire kindling.Use a wheelbarrow or yard waste bin if you want to move the stick pile somewhere else in your yard.	Add landscaping near deciduous trees. Decide if you need to collect the leaves. Rake pine needles first. Decide if you want to rake wet or dry leaves. Pick up sticks.
Overspending is the single most common reason for financial regrets. People spend more money they can afford, and then find themselves saddled with debt over unnecessary purchases and investments. Once you’ve put together a monthly “money regrets” budget, stick to it; don’t give into the temptation to purchase goods or services that put your total expenditure over your total income.It’s worth noting your motivation for overspending so you can reign in these impulses in the future. For example, do you overspend absentmindedly, or do you overspend socially (only when out with friends)?  , Many people also experience financial regret due to a lack of savings funds. For an individual without savings, any financial emergency—from medical bills to car payments—can be ruinous. To help leave your savings account intact, view it as money for emergencies or for unexpected expenses; don’t think of savings as a large reservoir of spending money.As a rule of thumb, you should always have on hand (e.g. in an easily accessible bank account) at least six months of net income.  No matter your age—provided that you’ve at least graduated from college—you should be thinking about your retirement, especially once you’ve found a career or are steadily employed. A large source of financial regret for individuals later in their lives comes from the fact that they did not plan ahead or save enough for retirement.You can avoid this mistake by increasing the amount of monthly savings you set aside (earmarked “for retirement”) or by increasing your monthly payments into your employer’s retirement system or a 401k account. As a general rule, about 20% of your income should be saved for financial priorities, including retirement and debt payment (if applicable).	Stop overspending. Bulk up your financial savings. Plan ahead for retirement.

This is a simple snake that you can make out of a paper plate. It lays flat on your table, but springs up into a long snake when you hang it! Here's a list of what you will need:   Paper plate Acrylic or tempera paint Paintbrushes, spongers, etc Pencil or pen Scissors Crayons, markers, or googly eyes Red paper or ribbon White school glue or tacky glue String, thumbtack, hole punch (optional) Rhinestones, glitter, etc (optional); , Be sure not to go too far into the middle or else it may not be big enough.   If you don't have a paper plate, use a small plate to trace a circle onto a large sheet of paper. Cut the circle out using a pair of scissors, and use that circle instead.  You can paint the snake however you want. You can use a paintbrush, a sponge, or even your fingers. Snakes come in many different colors and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Paint the plate a solid color and let the paint dry. Next, dip a sponge into a different color and tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel. Then, dab the sponge all over the plate. If you want to add another color, wait for the first one to dry. This will give you a scale-like effect.Wrap a sheet of bubble wrap (bubble-side-out) around a rolling pin and secure it with tape. Pour two colors of paint onto a palette and gently roll the pin across. Next, roll the pin across the plate. You will get a scale effect.You can also color the other side of the plate to make the snake's belly. Most snakes have a plain, light colored belly. Do this once the top of the snake dries., Make the spiral about half an inch thick. It doesn't have to be perfect, but try to make it even all the way around. The center of the spiral will be the snake's head, so make it rounded.   You are drawing the spiral on the back so that you won't see it on the top.  Start front the outside of the spiral, and work your way in. Try to do this right on the line, because you don't want the line to show on the finished product.  At this point, you can paint on some extra designs to make your snake even more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Paint thick stripes across the spiral to make a striped snake. Paint Xs or diamond shapes across the spiral to make a diamond pattern. Glue some colorful rhinestones using white school glue or tacky glue.Try not to add too many, or your snake will be too heavy. Make some squiggles and patterns on the snake using white glue. Then, shake some glitter onto the glue. Tap off the excess glitter and let the glue dry.  You can draw the eyes on using a marker or crayons. You can also paint the eyes on. If you have googly eyes at home, you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue.   Remember, the head is the rounded part in the middle of the spiral.  Cut a thin 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08) long rectangle out of red paper. You can also use a piece of thin, red ribbon. Cut a V shape into one end of the rectangle. This will be the snake's forked tongue. Lift the head up and glue the tongue under it.  You can punch the hole at the end of the tail, right between the eyes, or even in the tongue. Thread a piece of string through the hole and tie it in a knot. Use the other end of the string to hang the snake from a door knob, a stick, or even a thumbtack in the wall.	Gather your supplies. Cut off the raised edge of a paper plate. Paint or decorate the paper plate. Draw a spiral on the back of the plate. Cut out the spiral shape. Add more decorations to the snake. Add the eyes onto the front of the head. Add the tongue. Punch a hole through the snake if you want to hang it.
Chilies are one of the most wonderful plants to grow, because they come in such a wide variety of colours, sizes, tastes, and spice-levels. Chilies can be either an annual (must be replanted each year) or a perennial (grow back on their own). There are also three general types of chili: sweet, hot and ornamental. All three types have some level of spice, but sweet chilies are the mildest, ornamental have lovely colours and shapes (but can be very hot), and hot chilies are used primarily for their intense spice and flavour.   Chilies range from green, butter yellow, peachy orange, and fire-engine red, to plum and a pitch black hue. The colour doesn't have a direct correlation to the flavour or spice level of each chili pepper. Visit a local nursery to find out what variety will thrive in your local environment. Certain chilies are used in different areas of the world for special recipes; for example, Serrano chilies are used primarily in Mexican dishes, while the Calcutta pepper is used in Asian curries.; , Chilies are heat-loving plants, and are the most successfully grown in areas that have plenty of sun. Choose a plot in your garden that gets full sun or at least mostly sun for the majority of the day. If you live in a desert area, you may need a location with a bit of shade so that the chilies do not get sunburnt. If you live in an area that gets lots of rain, try to find a location in full sun with good drainage; too much water will drown out the chilies and cause them to grow less fruit.  If you don’t live in the traditional chili growing zones (near the equator), then you may benefit from growing your chilies indoors in pots during the winter, and then transplanting them outdoors in the spring when the weather warms up. Although you can certainly just plant your seeds directly into the ground, you might not have as high of chances of them sprouting than if you start them indoors and transplant them as seedlings.   You can grow chilies from seeds or starts from nurseries, but you’ll have much more variety with growing the former. Starting seedlings is easy; just plan it out at least 6 weeks prior to transplanting the chilies outdoors. Chilies can be transplanted outdoors after your area's last frost date.  The soil in your garden may need to be altered slightly in order to produce the biggest, healthiest, and heartiest crop of chilies. Chilies prefer soil that has good drainage and that has plenty of nutrients. Therefore, mix a bit of sand into your soil to help it to drain better, and incorporate in compost a few weeks or months prior to planting. If your soil has poor or average drainage, you can enhance it by mixing in a bit of sand. If potassium is not already present in sufficient amounts, then you’ll notice a significant growth boost if you increase the amount of potassium in the soil as well. Always test your soil first. If your soil is low in potassium, then visit a local nursery to choose a fertilizer that has lots of potassium and little nitrogen (like a 0-20-0 blend).Test the pH of your soil and determine if you need to make further adjustments; chilies like soil that has a neutral or slightly acidic pH of 6.5-7. The further in advance you can prepare your soil, the better your chilies will grow.  To help make the coating of the seed easier for the new growth to penetrate, you can use a damp paper towel and plastic bag to soften them up. Place a folded damp paper towel in a plastic bag and then place the seeds inside of the towel. Put the bag in a dry, warm place, such as a cupboard in your kitchen and leave them there for two to five days. The seeds should start to sprout within this time frame and then you can plant them., You can purchase seed trays for your seedlings, or you can simply use individual planting pots for each seed. Fill each small tray or container with your soil (already amended with fertilizer and compost). Then, place a single seed about ½ an inch below the surface of the soil in each container.  Seeds will need to be watered on a daily basis, so that the soil is kept moist at all times. Give seeds the biggest amount of water after first planting, and then continue adding about a teaspoon of water daily after that.  If you’ve planted seeds before, you may have a heat lamp on hand; heat lamps are perfect for aiding your seeds in growing quickly. If not, place your seeds in a location that gets plenty of sunlight, like a south facing window, and lots of heat, like near a radiator. Just be careful the seeds are neither too hot nor too cold, as both will result in little to no growth.  It will take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks for the seeds to first sprout. The seeds will sprout a pair of leaves to start, known as ‘seed leaves’. After a bit, a second pair of leaves will sprout; these are known as the ‘true leaves’ and signals that the chilies are ready for transplanting. You can continue waiting for them to grow and for the heat outdoors to rise, or you can plant them as is when their true leaves come in., Seeds that are grown indoors are used to a constant temperature with little fluctuation; when they are introduced into the ‘wild’, they can experience a bit of shock from the varying temperatures, moisture levels, and changing sunlight. Harden them off by placing their pots or trays outdoors for a few hours every day. Start at only 2 hours a day for about a week, and then add one hour to each additional day they are placed outdoors until they can stand being outside for a full 24 hours. At this point, they can handle being planted outside without fear of shock.  Wait to plant outdoors until after the last frost of the spring, typically around March or April depending on your local weather. Plant on a sunny day in the late morning or early afternoon when it’s not too hot, so as to avoid transplant shock.  Chilies should be planted individually to avoid crowding, even if you are planting seeds directly outdoors. Dig small holes slightly larger than your seed or root ball using a garden trowel. These should be spaced about 1 foot (0.3 m) apart, but depending on the type of chili you’re planting the spacing may need to be greater. Research the chilies you’re growing to find out the perfect spacing conditions for your plant.  Place each chili plant or seed into the holes you've dug. Replace the soil over the top of each, so that only about ¼ inch of soil is on top of the roots or seeds. Don’t tamp or press down on the soil too much when you’re finished, as the chilies will grow better in loose, well-draining soil.  Chilies will thrive when their soil is moist, but not soaking wet. After the first planting, give the chilies a bit of extra water to avoid transplant shock. Then, water them on a daily basis so that the soil is damp. If you’re growing sweet peppers, you can make them even sweeter by giving them more water than usual.  It will take a month or longer before the chilies begin flowering and bearing fruit, so you will need to maintain their health during this time. Pull out any weeds that you encounter, as these will steal space and nutrients from your chilies over time if you leave them. Incorporate compost and potassium fertilizer into the soil on a monthly basis to keep the nutrient levels high. You can also add a layer of mulch to the top of the soil, to lock in moisture and block out weeds.   Depending on the type of chilies you are growing, you may need to use a trellis. For example, bell peppers do better with the support of a trellis.  Time to harvest will vary between species of chilies, but you can generally tell when they’re ready by their size. Chilies will change colours, so unless you have a clear idea of what colour the ripe chili will be, don’t rely on colour as an indicator of ripeness. If you’re questioning whether a chili is ripe for picking, give it a taste! You’ll know whether it needs to continue growing for a bit longer, or if it’s ready to make a debut in your kitchen.If you're aiming to make chili powder or pepper flakes with your chilies, leave them to shrivel and dry up on their own on the branch before harvesting.

In a large stove pot, combine equal amounts of water and white vinegar. Mix the ingredients together, then set the pot on the stove., Measure out two or three tablespoons of lime or lemon juice. Dump them into the pot of water. If you don’t have juice, you can slice up a whole lemon and add it to the pot., Turn up the heat on the stove and allow the water to boil. Once it does, turn the heat back down to a simmering level.  Let the tarnished area of the aluminum soak in the water for 10-15 minutes. Again, if your piece does not fit in the pot, stop up the sink and dump the water in there along with the aluminum.Again, take precautions when transferring boiling water. Cover exposed skin and slowly pour the water into the skin.  Place the aluminum under a faucet. Use warm water to rinse off any of the acid left over., Most of the corrosion comes off during boiling. For anything left over, use a soft-bristled scrub brush, non-abrasive sponge, or toothbrush to attack the tarnished areas.   Steel wool does help rid the aluminum of tarnish you can’t otherwise remove. Scrub back and forth rather than in a circular motion. Steel wool does scratch aluminum, so use it as a last resort.  Use a soft cloth or a paper towel to remove all leftover moisture from your aluminum piece. This will ensure that it doesn’t gain water stains.	Mix water and white vinegar. Add citrus juice to the water. Bring the water to a boil. Place the aluminum into the water for 15 minutes. Rinse the aluminum with warm water. Scrub the aluminum with a soft brush. Dry the aluminum immediately.
Spill on hard floor: Dampen paper towels with mineral spirits and blot the spill before it dries. Spill on carpeting: Use the same method as you would use on a hard floor.

Although there are hundreds of named petunias, they tend to fall into four basic categories, which are determined by flower size and growth habit. Some of these types of petunias work better being grown in a container, while some are better suited to the garden.Grandiflora have the largest flowers and are the most commonly-used type of petunia. Some have single blooms while others are doubles and are available in both upright and cascading varieties. Multiflora petunias have smaller flowers but have masses of blooms and provide big splashes of color. Milliflora grow close to the ground and have small flowers. They are easy to control and thus work well as an edging plant. Ground cover petunias spread and trail along the ground, from window boxes, and cover large areas quickly. This type will need more frequent watering.; , After you've chosen the type of petunia you want, you'll need to pick the petunias themselves. There are some things that you should look for in terms of the best bedding plants.   Choose plants with healthy leaves and visible fresh growth. Contrary to popular belief, plants with the most flowers on them are not the ones you should pick. Instead, pick plants that have a few flowers and lots of bushy growth. Pick petunia plants for bedding that are compact (not tall and leggy) because these will thrive better.  All types of petunias need at least five to six hours of full sunlight per day, although they can tolerate some shade. The soil needs to be well-drained, although it doesn't have to be particularly nutrient-rich.   Petunias work well in containers, as well as planted in the garden. However, if you're going to plant them in a container you will want to make sure that you use a soil-less mix (a soil-less mix is composed of things like peat moss, composted pine bark, or coir, as well as inorganic components like sand)., Make sure to dig the soil so that it is nice and loose (allowing for better drainage). You want to both condition the soil and fertilize it to make it ready for petunias. If you're planting in the garden, condition the soil with organic matter like baled peat moss, leaf compost, or well-rotted manure. You'll need to spread this organic matter about two to three inches (5.1-7.6 cm) thick.   Incorporate the organic matter into the soil by using a garden fork to about the depth of eight to ten inches. This can help break up heavy clay soil, allowing for better water drainage or increase the ability of sandy soil to hold nutrients and moisture. Fertilize your soil by using a balanced fertilizer (like 8-8-8, 10-10-10, or 12-12-12) into your garden's soil. You'll want to do this at the rate of about two pounds per hundred square feet. When the season changes (early to mid-July) you'll want to give liquid fertilizer that's meant specially for flowering plants a try, at about every three weeks (although, weekly for spreading petunias). Now, if you're using a window box, or container, you'll need to mix timed-release fertilizer into the soil.  Most petunia varieties require at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) between plants in full sunlight. If you have to use a shadier location, then go for several inches closer together (around 10 in or 25.4 cm). There are some exceptions to this rule to keep in mind.   Milliflora petunias can be placed closer together than the other types with as little as four to six inches (10.2-15.2 cm) between them. Spreading (or “wave”) petunias, on the other hand, should really be spaced as much as one and a half feet (0.45 m) apart.  You want to begin bedding the plants in early spring to help acclimatize them to the outdoors. If you're planting them in the ground you should make sure to wait until after the danger of frost as past (or you can cover them at night to protect them from frost).You want the soil temperature to be about 60 degrees F (15.5 degrees C). Colder than that and the petunia won't flourish. If it is really hot, make sure to provide some shade for the petunias. Although they love and thrive on lots of sun, too much can have an adverse effect on them.  Petunias aren't exactly easy to grow from seedlings, but it can definitely be done and it usually means that you can cultivate more petunias for cheaper! Start your seedlings 10 to 12 weeks before you plan to plant them (early spring, is recommended, such as March in the northern climates).   Try to get pelleted seeds, because these are easier to handle, especially for inexperienced gardeners. Petunia seeds can be difficult to handle, because of their size, so make sure you take that into consideration.  Petunia seeds require specific conditions in which to sprout. They need somewhere warm and bright (about 70 to 85 degrees F or 21.1 to 29.4 degrees C) indoors, because they cannot yet handle being outside yet.   Spread the tiny seeds on top of fresh damp potting soil or sphagnum moss. Make sure that you spread them sparingly, so they don't crowd one another out as they are trying to grow. Press them into the potting material gently or water with a fine mist to wash them into the potting soil. Cover with clear plastic wrap and store in a bright warm spot away from direct sunlight until they begin to sprout (which usually happens seven to ten days after planting).  When the seedlings begin to sprout you will want to remove the plastic film. Move to bright, cool spot after sprouting. This usually takes place about seven to ten days after you plant the petunia seeds.   Move them to a brighter, cooler spot after they have sprouted. The best temperatures are 64 degree F (17.8 degrees C) days, with the temperature at night ranging from 55-65 degrees F (12.8-18.3 degrees C). Water your petunias gently every few days.  You will want the petunias to be at least four to six inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) beneath the light fixture. Make sure that you put a timer on the lights so that they are lit between 16 and 18 hours each day.   Raise the lights as the seedlings grow, so that there is always that four to six inch space between the petunias and the lights. You don't particularly need to get an expensive light fixture that is especial to growing plants. Ordinary fluorescent light tubes work just fine. Make sure that the plants are directly beneath the lights (unlike before they sprouted when you want the seeds away from direct sunlight).  You'll know it's time to transplant the seedlings when they have three true leaves each. Then it's time to put them in their own individual peat pots or packs that hold several plants each.   Feed them diluted liquid fertilizer until frost danger is past and you can plant outdoors. Be sure to plant in moderately fertile well-drained soil.  You'll do this by putting the young petunias outside on days that are sunny and warm. When it cools down for the night, bring them back inside, so that they stay warm.   After doing this for several days you can plant them outdoors permanently. It’s best to transplant on cloudy days because the hot sun can make transplant shock worse  , Depending on the type of petunia you'll need to do some deadheading and some pinching to encourage new growths and flowering side shoots. This will encourage more flowers.   For grandifloras and multifloras, when they reach about six inches (15.2 cm) tall, pinch them back so that you encourage the rapid formation of their flowering side shoots. Avoid pinching millifloras or "spreading" petunias. Maintain constant blooming of your petunias during the season by pinching off faded blooms (deadheading). Remove the entire flower structure, including the stem, down to the next “node” (or bump) of leaves. Multifloras won't need deadheading. Trim the plant by a third if it becomes too scraggly and isn't blooming well to encourage new growth and vigor.  You want to make sure that your petunia is healthy without over-fertilizing it. If the foliage of the petunia is looking healthy and vigorous, but the petunia isn't blooming, or isn't blooming well, you need to reduce the amount of fertilizer.   A good idea is to fertilize your plants monthly, because this will ensure good growth without over-fertilizing. Double-flowered cultivars, however, should have a biweekly dose of fertilizer.  Most petunia types are fairly easy-going when it comes to water. So a thorough watering about once a week should be good enough, unless the weather is incredibly dry. You want to soak to about a depth of six to eight inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) each time to you water.   Spreading types of petunias do need to be watered more frequently (more than once a week). Petunias in containers also need more watering depending on their size and the volume of the soil that they contain. Often petunias in containers need to be watered as much as once as day. A good rule of thumb is to allow at least one inch of soil on the top to dry before you water them again.  You will see signs of aphids and caterpillars, pests that can destroy your petunias. You will want to get rid of them so that the petunias will keep thriving.   If you see that you have aphids make sure to get rid of them by spraying the petunias with a strong blast of water. Keep doing this until the aphids are gone. Watch for small black droppings and holes in leaves and buds which may indicate caterpillars are after your petunias. Treat with environmentally friendly insecticide.  Sometimes the new flowers will wilt before they actually bloom. When this happens it's because you aren't watering them evenly. Allow the soil to dry out and water thoroughly.Make sure that you're watering at the base of the plant and not on the plant itself.  There isn't a whole lot that you can do about diseases like soft rot and mold. However, if you live in a rainy area, you might try planting the rain-resistant multiflora, rather than one of the other petunia kinds.   It's super important that you don't over-water. This can lead to problems with soft rot and mold.	Pick your type of petunia. Select your petunias. Choose the right place to plant them. Prepare the soil for planting. Space them correctly. Plant them in the right season. Start your seedlings. Prepare the seeds for sprouting. Take care of the newly sprouted seedlings. Place the petunia seeds beneath fluorescent lights.

Unwind roughly 6 inches (15 cm) of 0.5 mm brass craft wire. Cut the wire using side cutting pliers.   If you choose to use smaller or larger beads for this project, the amount of wire you'll need will also change. The length of wire you cut should always be approximately twice as long as the combined width of your teardrop beads, if not a little longer.; , Feed six 1-inch (2.5-cm) long teardrop beads onto the cut length of wire.   Ultimately, the pointed ends of all the teardrop beads must point in the same direction. The beads should also be positioned toward the center of the wire. You can alter the size of the teardrop beads as desired to create smaller or larger flowers, but the beads must all be the same size.  Wrap the center of the wire into a tight loop, drawing the points of your teardrop beads together.   There should still be some space at the center of the formed circle. The teardrop beads should be side by side, but they should still lie flat when placed on a flat surface. If you need help forming the loop, you can wrap the wire around a pencil or wooden towel.  Wrap the ends of the wire around one side of the top portion of each bead to help hold the beads in place.   Feed one wire end into the hole of the bead, then wrap it over the top side of the same bead before feeding it back into the hole again. Repeat for all six beads. Wrap three of the beads with the right wire end and the other three beads with the left wire end. Note that the wrapped side of the beads will be the back of the flower.  From the front of the flower, thread both wire ends through the center of a 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) round bead. Pull the wire ends until the round bead rests in the center of the flower structure.   Pull the wire ends up from the back of the flower to the front. Direct the ends so that they cut through the center of the flower structure. Feed the right wire end through the right side of the round bead and the left wire end through the left side of the round bead. Pull the ends in opposite directions to draw the round bead down into the center of the flower. If you use smaller or larger teardrop beads, the round bead will need to be smaller or larger, too. Choose a round bead that roughly matches the width of your teardrop beads.  Draw the ends of the wire back down to the bottom of the flower. Twist them together beneath the round bead to secure the entire structure.   If necessary, use round nose pliers to twist the wire tightly.  You can use this flower to decorate jewelry or other crafts. Simply position the flower over your chosen backing and twist the excess wire ends over and around that backing to hold the flower in place.   Once you've mounted the flower, use cutting pliers to trim the remaining wire. Hide the sharp wire ends beneath the beads.	Cut a length of wire. Thread the teardrop beads onto the wire. Wrap the beads into a loop. Secure each bead. Feed the wire ends into the round bead. Twist the wire. Use as desired.
You can also use less cornstarch to produce a more watery slime.          Because you’re using cornstarch rather than borax or liquid starch, this slime is a safe alternative for small children.  Stir with a spoon or with hands to combine.  Continue stirring until the desired consistency is achieved. Glow-in-the-dark craft paint is available at most craft stores as well as in the crafting section of many major stores.          As an alternative to glow-in-the-dark paint, you can instead use the ink from a highlighter to color your slime. Pry off the bottom of a highlighter and drop the ink filament that’s inside the highlighter tube into the bowl of water and cornstarch. With a gloved hand, squeeze the filament to extract the ink.Note that if using highlighter ink, it may only glow under a blacklight. You can also add drops of food coloring to change the hue of the slime, just remember that the food coloring may make the slime glow a little less.  Enjoy your glow-in-the-dark slime!	Pour the cornstarch into a medium-sized bowl. Add the water to the bowl of cornstarch. Add the craft paint. Finished!

The roots of trees keep the tree in place and are like hoses, seeking water for sustaining the tree through absorption. Tree roots are encouraged by:   Leaks in pipes and sewers: Here is an easy source of water to access! Cracks in pipes: Tree roots aren't capable of cracking pipes. Rather, tree roots seek water and if there is a crack, the root will enter via any crack and start increasing inside the pipe as the crack widens under the pressure, until there is a blockage caused by the roots. Surface of the soil: Most moisture and nutrients sit at the surface of the soil; hence, tree roots will form at the surface to take advantage of this. If it is a large and vigorous species of tree, this surface growth can crack pavement, pavers, etc.; , Siting the tree properly from the outset makes good sense. This even includes trying to think about future building on your site should this be something you might want to do down the track. Things to consider include:   Finding out where draining and water lines are and planting trees well away from these. Avoiding planting trees that you know will grow too large. Ask your local municipality if it can recommend which species of trees to avoid planting. See "Tips" for some of the more common problem trees.  Knowing where to avoid placing trees requires knowing how big the tree's roots will grow. The general rule is that trees produce roots equal to about three-quarters of the tree's mature height. This means a tree 20 meters (65.6 ft) high will have roots of 15 meters (49.2 ft).  You don't have to miss out on shade and greenery. Instead, prefer smaller tree species. At the same time, ensure that your plumbing is in good order and replace broken and cracked pipes as soon as you are aware of them.	Understand what happens with tree roots. Be considerate about where you plant trees. Know the general rule. Find smaller trees if you don't have the space.
, Pour 1 cup (100 grams) of all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl, then add ½ cup (150 grams) of salt. Next, add 2 to 4 tablespoons of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ground allspice, ½ teaspoon of ground cloves, and 2 teaspoons of ground ginger. Stir them together with a whisk until they are all evenly combined., Pour in a little bit of water, and stir it in with a rubber spatula. Stir in some more water, and mix again. You may end up using up to 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. Avoid using too much more, or the dough will turn out too sticky.  The dough should be soft and smooth. If it is sticky, add some more flour, and knead it some more., You can make your garland all one color, or many different colors. Start by separating your dough into clumps—one for each color. Next, add a few drops of food coloring into each clump, then knead it in until the color turns consistent. Fall colors, such as red, orange, and yellow work great for this.You can always paint the pieces after you bake them, but the paint may cover up the wonderful aroma.  Lightly flour a smooth surface, and roll the dough out using a rolling pin. Try to get the dough to be about ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) thick.  Hearts and stars are very popular, but you can also use circles, leaves, or other shapes.  Use a straw or knitting needle to punch the holes; keep them about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) apart from each other.If you'd like a touch of extra fragrance and design, stick whole cloves, pointy-side-down, into your ornaments., Return them to the oven, and let them baking for another hour, or until they are completely dry.Don't raise the temperature. This will cause the dough to rise and form bubbles., If the holes got covered up, gently open them back up by twisting a wooden skewer or knitting needle through them., Although not necessary, this can make your garland look prettier. Try not to get too carried away, however!Once you have decorated your pieces, let them dry.   For fancier ornaments, decorate them using glitter and glue. For rustic ornaments, glue some simple, 4-hole buttons onto them., If you choose to use ribbon, be sure to use the thinnest kind you can find. How long you cut your string depends on how long you want your garland to be. Most garlands will be about 4 feet (1.22 meters).  Take an ornament, and push the needle up through the first hole, then down through the second. Drag the ornament along the string until it is a few inches/centimeters from the end.  Leave some space between each ornament. If you decorated your ornaments, make sure that they are facing the same direction.  You can hang it from hooks or nails over a window, doorway, or fireplace mantle. You can also wrap it around a Christmas tree instead.	Preheat your oven to 285°F (140°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix together the dry ingredients. Stir in the water until the mixture turns to dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and knead it some more. Consider adding some color. Roll the dough out. Cut the dough into shapes using cookie cutters. Poke two holes into the center of each ornament. Transfer the ornaments to your prepared baking sheet, then bake them for 2 to 3 hours.After 1 hour, use a spatula to turn the ornaments over. Take the ornaments out of the oven, and let them cool. Consider decorating your ornaments. Cut some ribbon, yarn, or twine for your garland, then thread it through a yarn or tapestry needle. Thread your string through your first ornament. Continue threading the ornaments onto the ribbon or cord. Tie small loops into each end of your garland, then hang your garland up.
Set aside and allow to dry.; , Place the contents into a separate dish or bowl.	Collect used teabags. Remove the contents from the teabags.
Pinching carnations as they grow encourages the growth of lateral stems, which means more flowers will grow. Pinching is especially important if you want to grow flowers for cutting.   Pinching also helps the plant to grow bushy rather than as a single tall stem, which some gardeners prefer. The height at which you pinch the plant stem off is the height at which it should start to bush from. This allows you to influence the height of your plant.; , Leaf nodes are the swollen bit of stem from which the leaves will later emerge. The leaf nodes usually appear when the plant is about 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall.   Do a second round of pinching about 4 weeks later once the lateral (side) stems emerge. Again, you should pinch the lateral stems once they are about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long. Nursery plants will often have had their first pinching already if you purchase plants that are at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) high. However, you may want to pinch the lateral (side) stems once they reach 6 inches (15.2 cm) in length if this doesn't seem to have been done at the nursery. If you grow carnations yourself from seed, you’ll need to do pinch the plants yourself.  Once the plant is about 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) in height and has about 5-6 swollen leaf nodes in evidence on the stem, remove or pinch off the tip of the stem above the sixth leaf node. The stem should be tender enough to do this with your fingertips.   After this first pinching, lateral (side) shoots should emerge. Repeat the pinching process once these side shoots reach 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) in length. After you have pinched your plant, it is a good time to stake it. Tie it loosely to a support such as a sturdy garden cane using string or garden wire.  Over pinching can delay blooming, so stop pinching once the leaves start to form. If you want to ensure a long flowering season, pinch only half of the lateral stems. This way you get two flushes of blooming.  Perpetual carnations can be encouraged to flower again by making sure they are watered during dry weather.   This means watering them about every 5-7 days through the summer or perhaps every 3 days in very dry, hot weather. Also give your carnations regular feeds, pinch the stems and remove the withered flower heads.  It’s important to protect perpetual flowering carnations from frost. You can grow them under glass or in a polytunnel, but it’s vital to keep them above 45F so you may need a source of heat, even in a greenhouse. Of course, you can also grow them as house plants.  Avoid using manure or high-nitrogen fertilizers for carnations, as they won’t bloom as well. Also keep in mind that you should never mulch carnation plants.   If planted outside, you should add lime to the soil to improve the alkalinity, and use a fertilizer that isn't too high in nitrogen relative to other components, such as potash (potassium) and phosphorus.  During the growing season carnations will need feeding regularly – about once every two weeks – with a weak solution of water-soluble fertilizer. Avoid slow release fertilizers or ones labeled ‘granular’. These release nutrients too slowly to be of much use during the growing season.  After a few years, even perpetual carnations won’t perform as well. You can rejuvenate your carnation plants by dividing at the root to make new plants. To divide a carnation:   Dig it up and gently separate the root mass using your hands. Replant the divided sections and water them well. Continue watering for the next few months once the soil is dry below the surface.  Taking cuttings is also a great way to reproduce your carnation plants after a few years. Make sure your plant is healthy before you take cuttings from it.   Starting early in the morning, cut a piece of fresh shoot about 4 inches (10.2 cm) in length from a section of stem that isn't flowering. Cut below a swollen leaf node; make sure your tools are sharp and not dirty. Strip off any lower leaf growth. Dip the stem in some a rooting powder and bury half the length in some sand. Give the cutting some water, cover with a transparent plastic bag and put it into a well-lit place but not in direct sun. A window ledge that is not facing sun is ideal. Make sure you keep the cuttings watered until they root.  An unusual method called ‘layering’ can also be used to make new carnation plants. Mix some sand and compost in the area close to the plant you wish to propagate from, then water the mix. You want to get a healthy side shoot and remove any leaves from the lower part.   Halfway along the length make a vertical slit in the stem using a thin blade such as a craft knife. This allows you to bend the stem over and plant the cut middle stem area into the soil mix. You may need to weight this down using a piece of bent wire to ensure it remains in the ground where it will root eventually. Keep the soil mix watered moist for up to 2 months when it will have rooted enough to be removed from the parent plant for replanting elsewhere.	Pinch your carnations to help flowers grow. Start pinching carnations after the first half dozen sets of leaf nodes emerge. Pinch your carnations with your fingers. Stop pinching when the leaves start to form. Make sure to water your plants regularly during dry weather. Protect your plants from frost. Don’t use nitrogen manures or fertilizers. Feed the carnations with water-soluble fertilizers every two weeks. Divide your carnations for continued plant health. Take cuttings from carnation plants. Propagate your carnation plants using the layering technique.
Use a tape measure, yardstick, or meter stick to measure the length and width of your room. Also account for the dimensions of any alcoves or other recessed spaces in the room.; , You can use formal grid paper, but you can also sketch it out on notebook paper or plain printer paper. Determine how much space you can spare for furniture and sketch out a few different ways that furniture can fit into the room. You should also factor in at least one yard (1 meter) of free space in between pieces of furniture. Anything smaller than that will make you feel as though you have to squeeze in between your furniture as you walk.  Measure how wide your doorways are to prevent potential delivery mishaps. You do not want to purchase a piece of furniture only to discover that you cannot get it into your house.  After determining how much space you can spare for furniture and where you want potential pieces to go, mark those spaces on the floor to get a better visual. Use painter's tape or spread out sheets of newspaper.  If your living room will act as a daily family hangout, you will need sturdy, stain-resistant furniture, especially if your kids are still young. On the other hand, if your living room will only entertain the occasional guest, you can opt for more fragile pieces made with delicate fabrics.  Some rooms contain built-in design elements that may help you determine the type of furniture that will look best inside the room. For instance, if you have a rustic fireplace, cabin décor may be a better option than stark modern furniture. Modern furniture may be the best option for a living room of an apartment with a view overlooking the city, however.	Take measurements. Create a floor plan. Check your doorways. Stage your living room. Think about how the room will be used. Note the room's natural architecture.
Greens with dark leaves (such as spinach) and many root vegetables (such as carrots and beets) tend to work well as food dyes because they have deep, consistent, opaque coloring. Your natural food dyes will be most effective if you choose veggies that are mostly one color throughout (and which have a color that is bright or deep).Some vegetables may seem like good candidates for natural food dye, but if they have high water content (as does celery) they will actually produce very weak, light shades. Many vegetables (even those with vibrant coloring) lack the thick, concentrated juices produced by many fruits. In general, do not expect vegetable-based food dyes to be as bright or even as those made from berries. Beets (for red) and carrots (for orange) are exceptions to this rule.; , Some vegetables leach color into the water when boiled. The vegetables that work best for this are those with lots of water content (and therefore juices) that are also deeply hued. Red cabbage (for purple) and beets (for red or pink) are two great examples of vegetables that can be boiled to extract their coloring.For a more concentrated color, only use as much water as is needed to barely cover the vegetables. The colored water becomes the dye -- the more you dilute it, the lighter the shade. A good rule of thumb for figuring out which vegetables produce the best colors is that those that stain your fingers when handling them will also easily dye the foods with which they come into contact.  Use a food dehydrator or set your oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit and place the item(s) inside on an oven-safe tray. Cook them until they are as dry as possible (without becoming burned); this could take up to six hours.For large vegetables (especially sphere shaped ones), cut them into extremely thin slices before dehydrating them. This will speed up the process and dry them more consistently. Once dried, your vegetables can be safely stored in an airtight container for several months to a year.  Use a coffee grinder or food processor to do this most efficiently. The finer the powder, the less the dye will affect the texture of the food you wish to color.You can also use a mortar and pestle to grind the veggies by hand, but this will take much longer and could result in less even consistency. Thoroughly rinse off any utensils you use to make the powder before using them to grind up a different color of dried food. This will keep you from contaminating the color and flavor (if any) of your next veggie powder.  Many vegetables/herbs can be purchased in dried, powdered form, which eliminates the need to do the drying and grinding yourself. Just be sure to select those without added spices or flavoring so you don't influence the flavor of the food you wish to color.   If you are not worried about watering down your food, you can mix the powder into a small amount of water or other liquid and then stir this into the food. Do this gradually to achieve the right color and avoid over-saturating your food. For yellow dye, use stale turmeric. Turmeric is often used to give vegan puddings and tofu scrambles their "eggy," yolk-like shade. Stale turmeric tends to have lost quite a bit of its natural flavor, so use this to avoid influencing the taste of your colored food.	Choose vegetables with consistent coloring. Boil your vegetables. Dehydrate your vegetables or herbs. Grind the dried veggies into a powder. Select foods that are already in powder form.
You don't need to splurge on fancy bedding for your baby's crib. You can stick to plain colored sheets and blankets over decorative colors, which may be more expensive. If you can't afford a large printed blanket, go for four smaller printed blankets.Make sure any bedding you get is baby safe. You can save money by foregoing things like extra decorations while still buying from a reputable company.  Dressers can be pricey, but many stores sell bookshelves for relatively cheap. If a dresser is out of your budget, get a bookshelf instead. Fold and stack your baby's clothing in this shelf.If you want a little more organization, invest in baskets and storage bins. You can use these to separate your baby's toys and clothes.  You can save money by thinking ahead. Do not buy items exclusively for a baby's room. Look for items that will age along with the child. For example, a dresser with cutesy cartoon animals may not fit in a nine-year-old's room. However, a brightly colored dresser with something like stripes or polkadots will still be acceptable as your baby gets older.	Opt for minimal crib bedding. Use a bookshelf for a dresser. Look for pieces you can keep long term.
In areas not used to grow other crops, you can apply tebuthiuron (Spike) to your soil. This can kill blackberry bushes, but may also harm other surrounding vegetation.Place tebuthiuron pellets to the base of blackberry plants to control their growth long-term.Be aware that tebuthiuron is toxic not only to vegetation, but can also be to mammals, too.It is also water soluble, so it can easily contaminate ground water. Wear protective clothing when you apply tebuthiuron to minimize your exposure to the pesticide.Make sure to check and see if it is legal to use tebuthiuron where you live. It has been banned in Europe since 2002 because if its toxicity.  One of the most effective ways to kill blackberries is by applying an herbicide directly to the plant while it is actively growing. This allows it to get into the plant’s structure and kill rhizomes, thus deterring regrowth.Use foliar-based herbicides, which you apply to the part of the plant visible above the ground, in early summer or at the start of the growing season when their tissue is rapidly expanding.Spray herbicides such as glyphosate, dicamba, or triclopyr on the blackberry bush.You can purchase these at many home improvement and hardware stores. Be careful when mixing and applying these chemicals because they can kill other plants. Make sure to avoid contact with your skin as well.  Since the bark at the base of the bush helps transport the nutrients needed for the plant to survive, treat it with an herbicide. This can help kill the bush at any time of year and also minimize contact with chemicals.Use a concentrated form of triclopyr to treat the basal bark.Spray the solution directly at base of the bush directly on the bark.Cover about 6-12 inches of the basal bark with spray, depending on how large the plant is.Make sure to not oversaturate the bark with the solution, which can cause toxic runoff., An alternative way to administer triclopyr is to spray the dormant stems and leaves of your blackberry bush. This can also kill the plant while minimizing your contact with the chemical.Use this solution only in the fall and winter when the plant stem and leaves are dormant.Spray the plant until it is thoroughly wet, again avoiding oversaturation that can cause toxic runoff., If your blackberry bush growth is especially pernicious, consider hiring a landscape professional. He can help you assess and deal with the problem without killing off all of your other vegetation.Discuss your concerns with the landscaper and ask about how to manage the situation more effectively after his treatment. The Landscape Contractors Association can help you find a qualified landscape professional in your local area.	Place an herbicide in the soil. Apply an herbicide directly on the plant. Treat the basal bark. Spray the dormant stems and leaves. Hire a landscape professional.
To achieve ASE certification, you need at least two years of experience working in the industry in some capacity. You can elect to take the test first, provided you've secured employment, but it won't go into effect until after you've worked for two years. It's up to you if you want to work first or take the test.   The two-year experience requirement can be waived if you have completed a three- to four-year apprenticeship program or two-year co-op program.

For the simplest brass cleaning option, buy a rotary tumbler. Rotary tumblers are machines that polish and clean, and are a good option for cleaning brass casings in that they operate quietly and cost less than other tumblers. The disadvantages of this tumbler are that they operate slowly and use more polishing media than other tumblers., Vibratory tumblers are a loud but fast option for cleaning brass casings. Depending on the model you choose, and the size and condition of your casings, cleaning might take between 2-3 hours.Choose a newer model with a built-in timer to make cleaning easier, and determine what size you should buy based on your needs (e.g. large models can hold up to 900, 9mm cases).  Keep up to date on what products are available for case cleaning by visiting message boards online or browsing online stores. For the best clean, choose a cleaning solution that will remove powder fouling residue, dirt, and discoloration. For instance, the Iosso case cleaner kit contains a bottle of cleaning solution, as well as a bucket and strainer bag, to submerge and clean up to 1,500 brass casings., If you only need to give your brass casings a light cleaning, opt for corn cob media. Brass casings which have only been fired once, or that are not overly tarnished, can be cleaned with this media. Shop for treated corncob media, which contains an extra polishing compound that will leave your brass looking extra clean., Brass casings that are more heavily tarnished, either used without a cleaning for many re-loadings or left on the ground for too long, need an aggressive media. Walnut shell is a good option that can be used in both rotary and vibratory tumblers. Purchase treated walnut shell media rather than untreated walnut shell media, which would require you to add extra polish to clean your casings effectively. , Stainless steel pins are the most effective media for cleaning brass casings as they clean them inside more effectively than walnut shell and corncob. This media also does not require extra polish, but it can only be used in a rotary tumbler. Add dish detergent or a cleaning product to the mix for the most effective clean possible. , Always make sure to sort your brass casing by size and type before cleaning them. If you do not sort them, the smaller casings may become lodged inside the larger casing during the tumbling process, or be damaged by them. Lay down an old towel or sheet and spread out your casings on it, then separate them into different containers., To start cleaning your casings, add the media of your choice to the machine, as well as some polishing powder, and your brass casings. If you are using stainless steel pins as media in a rotary tumbler, add water and dish detergent, or another cleaning product. Shut the tumbler firmly and start the machine.Refer to the directions for your particular machine to determine the quantities of media and polishing agent to add.  If you are using a vibratory tumbler, run it for 2-3 hours to clean your casings. If you are using a rotary tumbler, you will have to run it longer (closer to 8 hours). Check your casings when you stop the machine to determine if you would like them to be cleaner, and add time accordingly., To remove any debris that might remain from the cleaning media, rinse your brass casings under water. Separate them from the media by hand and place them in a large strainer, or in a large bucket (using a small strainer to rinse one small portion of them at a time). Rinse under water until all signs of debris are gone., After rinsing your casings, lay a dry towel onto the ground, Spread out your newly washed casings in a single layer on the towel. Leave them out to air dry for several days to ensure that they are fully dry.	Buy a rotary tumbler. Purchase a vibratory tumbler. Purchase case cleaning products. Use corn cob. Opt for walnut shell. Go for stainless steel pins. Sort your brass casings. Set the machine. Run the machine. Rinse your brass casings. Dry the casings.
If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it. For dusty or lightly soiled fabrics that cannot be washed, use a vacuum or a brush. For heavily soiled fabrics that cannot be washed, use a specially-formulated fabric cleaner.  You want the container to be large enough so that you can submerge all of your fabric in the detergent mixture.  If parts of the fabric keep floating to the top, you can weigh them down with a glass jar or bottle., Do not fold it over a hanger, or the two sides will stick to each other. Instead, clip the top of the fabric piece to a hanger. If the fabric is too big for a hanger, then stretch a long piece of string between two poles or trees, and clip the fabric to that. You want the fabric to hang freely, in a single layer.  Stir the solution to help the alum powder dissolve. You can buy alum powder at a grocery store., If it floats to the top, then weigh it down with a glass jar or bottle.  Once again, make sure that the fabric is hanging freely. Clip it to a hanger, or to a piece of string.	Start with a clean piece of fabric. Mix 1 pound (0.45 kg) of laundry detergent with 2 gallons (7.5 L) of hot water in a large container. Soak the fabric in the mixture until it is completely saturated. Hang the fabric to air-dry in the sun. Combine ½ pound (0.25 kg) of alum with 2 gallons (7.5 L) of hot water in a second container. Soak the fabric in alum powder solution for at least 2 hours.Make sure that the fabric is completely submerged. Hang the fabric in the sun to air-dry completely.
You'll need about half of a yard of fabric to make one bow. The classic hair bow shape looks pretty with any type of fabric or pattern. Choose a solid color that matches your favorite outfit or go for a funky pattern that will make a statement. Consider the following options when you pick out your fabric:   Sturdy fabrics like cotton, linen or denim will make your bow stiff and well-shaped. Stretchy or limp fabrics will create a floppy bow. Choose a fabric with a texture that will create the look you want. Large designs won't be completely visible once the fabric has been turned into a bow. Small polka dots, stripes, and other tiny patterns will show up well.; , There are many ways to affix the finished bow to your hair. Look for the following options at your local craft store:   If you want to wear the bow as a barrette, buy a plan metal barrette to attach to the finished bow. Consider gluing the hair bow onto a fabric or plastic headband.  The fabric and the backing are the most important elements of the hair bow, but to complete the job you will also need these other supplies:   Thread to sew the bow. Choose thread that is the same color as your fabric or go with a contrasting thread that will stand out. Fabric scissors. Sewing pins to hold the bow in place while you sew. A sewing machine or a needle you can use to sew by hand. A glue gun or extra-strength fabric glue.	Find the right fabric. Choose a backing for the bow. Buy other bow-making supplies.
Learn advanced ballet technique. If you intend to teach advanced ballet classes, study with master teachers who have performed and taught extensively. Gain rudimentary knowledge of ballet for teaching young children. If your goal is to teach recreational ballet to kids, your ability to hold their attention and create an interesting class will be more important than mastering advanced ballet technique.; , Ask permission from dance schools to observe classes. Pay close attention to the interaction between the teacher and her students, as well as the specific teaching methods that keep students engaged.    Decide what movements and terminology you will teach in a single class. In a dance studio where you teach the same dance level each time, your class attendees may be different from day-to-day. When teaching an introductory ballet class, cover the basic ballet positions and other fundamental movements, such as plie�, tendu, jete, releve and retire. Outline a plan for long-term students. If teaching in a college or community center where students have committed to attending class regularly, create a plan for the entire program. Start with basic ballet positions and teach more involved dance sequences by the end of the program.  Ballet classes have barre routines, across the floor movements and a sequence to be performed in the center of the room. Adhere to this structure closely so that students know what to expect from one class to the next.    Buy a ballet class compilation CD. Purchase music online or visit a music store. Ask your ballet teacher(s) for recommendations. Compile your own CD. Select music with the appropriate tempo, mood and rhythm to match the movements and skill level.  If the dance studio has a strict dress code for students, such as a black leotard, pink tights and ballet shoes, abide by the same attire to set a good example. In community centers, it is generally acceptable to be more relaxed in your dance attire.    Enunciate the names of the ballet movements. Repeat them each time to reinforce learning. Limit extensive explanations during the ballet class. Students will learn more by watching and attempting to do the movements themselves. Use brief metaphors if necessary. For students who need imagery, liken ballet movements to common images. Study the motion of animals and the appearance of nature, and verbally express them as metaphors for dance movement.  If the majority are intermediate students, move at their pace.   Work independently with slower students during breaks or after class. Recommend slower students to other appropriate level classes, if available. Challenge more advanced students. If the class is doing 2 turns, for example, ask advanced students to attempt 3 or 4 turns.  Your teaching ability will strengthen with repeated practice. Use your passion for the dance form to inspire your students to persevere and enjoy the learning process.	Master the appropriate level of ballet technique. Observe the teaching styles of competent ballet teachers. Create a lesson plan based on the setting and student ability. Structure your class. Select appropriate ballet music. Wear appropriate ballet attire. Speak clearly and concisely when teaching ballet. Target your teaching to the skill level of the majority. Display confidence and enthusiasm.
The rubbing alcohol will help get rid of any oil residue that might prevent the Mod Podge from sticking to the surface. From now on, try to avoid handling the jar on the outside as best as you can; hold the jar by the inside.; , The most popular colors of sea glass are blue, green, and turquoise. You can also skip the food coloring to get white sea glass. There are no rules for sea glass, however, so you can use any color you want.   If you can't find Mod Podge, or any other type of decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing 3 parts white school glue with 1 part water. Try mixing food coloring colors. 3 drops of blue food coloring and 1 drop of green will give you a nice, ocean color. Consider adding a drop of dish soap. It will help make the glass look even more frosted., Turn the glass upside down, so the bottom of the glass is facing you. Using long, downward strokes, apply the colored Mod Podge using a flat paintbrush. You can also tap it on using a pouncer or foam brush instead.  Be sure to let each coat dry before adding another one.The more coats you add, the more opaque your sea glass will be. It will also help conceal any streaks to a certain extent; keep in mind that there will almost always be some streaking.   Let the jar dry on a sheet of wax paper. This way, it won't stick., This will help lock the color, and prevent it from chipping off as easily. Be sure to use a matte finish. Once the sealer dries, you can turn the jar upright, and add some sealer to the top rim.   Do a patch test first. Some people find that certain brands of sealer actually remove the Mod Podge.	Clean your jar with soap and water, pat it dry, then wipe it down using rubbing alcohol. Mix 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of Mod Podge with a 1 to 4 drops of food coloring in a small bowl. Paint the Mod Podge onto the glass. Wait for the Mod Podge to dry, then apply 2 to 3 more coats, if desired. Consider sealing the jar when you are finished.
If you're a decent tailor, fabric may be a better choice for the outside of your Mau5head than paint. Fabric is strong, durable, and looks great. Even better, though, is the fact that fabric coverings are interchangeable, allowing you to rock several different Deadmau5 looks without having to re-paint your mask!  , If you're pressed for time, waiting several days for a papier mâché mask to dry can be a non-starter. If you can get your hands on one, you may want to instead use a thin yet sturdy plastic lamp globe as the central "head" portion of your mask. Acrylic plastic lamp globes work well. Obviously, you'll want one roughly the same size as the mask above (14" (35.56 cm) in diameter)). Lamp globes are often available from specialty home furnishers and at some department stores.   Bonus points if it already includes a hole at the bottom that's big enough for your head!  , Finally, you may find that your Mau5head is more comfortable if you secure a sturdy piece of headgear to the inside of the mask so that you can comfortably "wear" the mask on your head. You can do this with superglue (or, if you're worried about damage to your headgear, lots of tape).   Heavy pieces of headgear, like hard hats, can put stress on the mask when you're not wearing it. Make sure your mask is strong and rigid enough to support the weight of any headgear you install inside it to keep your mask from imploding!	Use fabric, rather than paint. Use a lamp globe, rather than a papier mâché sphere. Mount a bike helmet or hard hat inside the mask for added comfort.
Horror movies are a particularly formulaic genre, as anyone who has watched a lot of horror can attest. This means, however, that astute viewers can usually piece together the general arc of action and suspense. While this may "ruin" the scares a bit, it helps you realize that the scares in horror aren't real -- they are manufactured in a very similar way to get a very similar response from all viewers:    First is a scene meant to scare you immediately, such as the first victim or the release of the "evil" at the heart of the film.  Second comes establishment of characters and locations. This is usually the place of the first jump scare -- not the real villain or scare, but something to put you on edge.  Third comes the first death or scare, while people think things are still "normal" in the horror world. The jump scare usually coincides with this death, if there is one.  Fourth comes the worst/scariest part of the film -- the bodies mount up and the characters slowly realize that things are not looking good. Expect 1-2 more jump scares.  Fifth and finally comes the defeat of the villain (or is it?!), and this section is usually more action-heavy than the rest. There may be 1-2 jump scares, but they are usually easy to see coming., Because most horror films follow cookie-cutter plots, this isn't where most directors look for inspiration or originality. Horror is a very stylized, unrealistic genre that takes great creative leaps in lighting, costume design, sound/music, and theme in order to stay relevant. Most horror connoisseurs don't watch horror to get scared all of the time, they watch it to enjoy great artists pushing an extreme and stylish genre to its limits, all while serving up a delicious shot of adrenaline.    Cinematography in horror films is extreme and artistic. Pay attention to the lights and common colors, crazy camera angles, and interesting jumps or cuts.  Social themes are common motifs in horror, exploring what society fears through art. From Night of the Living Dead to It Follows, look for the real-life metaphors.  Sound and Music are subtle but key. It's been shown that sound on its own is often scarier than pure visuals. Anyone who's ever been alone at night in a creaky house knows that, but ask yourself how the filmmakers are able to pull off this same effect in the movie., A truly great horror movie is scary because you never see the events and scares coming. While all horror films will follow the "rules" outlined above to various degrees, you should be prepared for a great horror flick to break these rules in crucial, terrifying ways. The best way to avoid jumping, at the end of the day, is to never watch horror movies in the first place. But what is the fun in that?!  , You may get annoyed at how easily you flinch during a jump scare, even one that you see coming, but there is a very good reason for the jump. Almost all mammals share this "startle reflex," as it naturally moves you away from potential danger without having to take the time to think of it. Even if it's not fun, it is hardwired into human DNA to move when scared.	Recognize common formula used in 99% of horror films to get past the tension in them. Watch horror films with an eye for style over substance. Remember that the best horror movies are the ones that subvert, not conform, to your expectations. Know that your jumping or flinching is an evolutionary advantage worth keeping around.
Open your hands and clap your palms against each other, with the fingers held up towards the sky. Do it hard enough to get a good loud smacking sound out of it, but not so hard you turn your hand red.   Some people clap more by clapping the fingers of one hand against the palm of the other. Do whatever feels most comfortable for you.; , You know when the Queen comes out of the castle and deigns to applaud her loyal subjects with a brief applause? That's what you're going for. A demure clap can be done just by clapping with the first two fingers, tapping them into your palm. It should make very little noise, giving the impression that you're clapping more than actually contributing to the group.  Not all cultures or situations call for hand on hand clapping. Learn to use other types of claps so you'll be prepared to celebrate in all situations.   Stomping your feet is a common way of applauding at some camps and in some sporting events. It makes more of a thunderous rumble that can be quite intimidating and fun. Rapping your knuckles on the table after a lecture used to be common in some boarding schools, as opposed to clapping. To snap or not to snap? The cliché that beret-wearing hipsters snap at each others poems at jazzy cafes is a cliché based on an out-of-date 1940s stereotype. If you snap your fingers at a poetry reading, you'll probably be the only one. It's like yelling "Freebird" at a rock concert., In situations in which it’s inappropriate to made noise, or when the audience is primarily hearing-impaired or deaf, the general way of clapping is to raise your hands with your palms facing away from you, and to wiggle your fingers.   Sometimes called "sparkling," this is also used to agree or to support a speaker during meetings of consensus, Quaker meetings, or other events during which speaking out is not allowed.  A slow clap starts and builds gradually into a roar of applause. To start a slow clap, begin clapping no more than once every two seconds and gradually wait for others to build and join in with you. Gradually, speed up.   Slow clapping can often mean a variety of things. Traditionally, a slow clap was considered a kind of heckle instead of a celebration, though now it's considered a kind of winking or ironic celebration of something dramatic "epic." You might slow clap your little brother after he finally cleans his bedroom, for instance.  Clapping can be a great way of showing your appreciation, but it can also be rude if you clap at the wrong time. In certain situations, it’ll be obvious when to clap, but other times are more ambiguous. Not sure when to clap? The best way to avoid an awkward situation is to wait to clap until you hear applause, then join in.   Use the volume of people clapping around you to keep your volume at an appropriate level. Match your style of clapping to the rest of the crowd. Is it appropriate to clap after a soloist at church? After a good movie? After a solo during a concert? It’ll change in every situation. Go with what happens around you.  The most common purpose and moment for applause is when something great has just happened in public that deserves celebrating. Speeches, athletic events, and concerts are all common places to clap.   Points in athletic competition, or great plays are often rewarded with clapping and applause in many cultures. In others, overly-dramatic displays of emotion are somewhat looked down on, but if people are clapping it's probably a safe bet that you won't be glared at. Most people clap after songs at a pop music concert of any kind, as well as when performers come to and leave the stage. At public speaking events, it's common to welcome a speaker to the stage, and congratulate them at the end of a speech or performance. Depending on the occasion, it's usually uncommon to clap in the middle of most performances, unless directed by the performer. Sometimes accompanying clapping might be requested, or to "Give a hand" to someone present. Follow instructions.  As soon as the clapping starts to die down, it’s ok to stop clapping. Clapping isn’t a chance to interrupt a performance, it’s a chance to celebrate it. Get quiet with the crowd and don't act silly.  It’s also common to clap as a part of audience participation at some music events or concerts. If the performance was particularly great, continue clapping and try to prompt the performer to come back out for one more song or routine. At the very least, you might get another bow.   As long as you’re tactful, clapping with the beat is a common occurrence at many concerts.  If, for some reason, you're on stage being celebrated, clapping along with everyone else can be a nice, humble-looking maneuver, done properly. Bow your head to acknowledge the thanks, then start clapping with everyone else. If it goes on too long, give the cut sign and start your thank-yous.   Always thank an audience for any applause that you receive. It's also common to prompt applause for other people present. If, for example, you're giving a big speech and your thesis advisor is present, you might wan to recognize her for applause.  The rules about clapping during classical performances will depend on the venue, the group of musicians playing, the director, and the piece. It's usually only common to applaud in between individual pieces, and in some cases in between particular movements of a longer piece. In some cases, it's only appropriate to clap to welcome the performer to the stage and to clap at the end of the performance.   Refer to the program for specific instructions regarding clapping, or wait to clap until you hear other people clapping to be sure. It used to be common in the age of Mozart for crowds to be more disruptive. Particularly moving passages would cause audiences to break into applause while the musicians were still playing. Many people attribute the newer attitude regarding applause to Wagner, who's direction to avoid curtain calls for Parsifal is thought to have confused some concert-goers into thinking that absolute silence was essential., Traditionally, choral music is not applauded, and is to be appreciated in rapt and contemplative silence. At more modern praise churches, on the other hand, it's very common to applaud the performance after its given. At Pentecostal churches, clapping is pretty much part of the sermon. Every church will be different, so be observant and go with the flow. Don't be the first to clap at church, but join in if you hear the joyful sound.	Do the basic clap. Do the royalty clap. Clap without your hands. Clap silently. Do the slow clap. Wait to clap until you hear clapping. Clap to celebrate excellent performances. Stop clapping when it starts to taper off. Clap at the end of a concert to request an encore. Applaud if you’re being applauded. Be careful when clapping during classical music. Clap after music at some churches.
Use a hammer to tap the top of the stake into the ground a half inch (12.7 mm) into the ground. The post should be one or two inches away from the tree or plant that you want to protect.If you are trying to protect a larger fruit tree, make sure that you get a long enough post so that animals won't be able to reach your fruit.  Press down on the edges of the sleeve and roll the sleeve lengthwise. This will help open up the wire mesh so that you can slide it over your fruit tree. Once it's rolled, unroll it and open up the mesh so it looks like a tube.  The wire mesh sleeve should fit over the stake that you put into the ground as well as your fruit tree. If the trunk of your fruit tree is larger, you may have to wrap the wire mesh around the tree.  Overlap the wire mesh on top of the post in the ground and carefully staple it one inch from the top and bottom of the post. Continue to add staples with a staple gun every inch apart until the mesh sleeve is securely fastened to the post in the ground.  If there is leftover mesh on the top of your tree guard, it could prevent the tree from growing. Use wire cutters to cut off any remaining mesh at the top and allow there to be a hole so that your tree can continue growing.	Drive a 4-foot (1.2 meters) wooden stake into the ground. Roll your mesh sleeve up. Slide the mesh sleeve around the post. Staple the mesh around the post. Cut off any remaining mesh on the top of your post.
While there is no guarantee that pursuing a Master of Business Administration degree will allow you to meet Warren Buffett, this is actually the best method to pursue if you hope to speak with him in person.   Six times each year, Mr. Buffett invites graduate level business students from 45 universities to come to his office in Omaha, Nebraska. During these visits, the students interact with him during a 90-minute question and answer session. Afterward, he treats the students to lunch. Each college can only send 20 students, and of those students, 30 percent or more must be women.  Warren Buffett has a shareholder meeting once every year. You can hear him speak, but the odds are low that you will actually be able to meet him or speak to him in return.   The meeting is usually on the first Saturday of May. For more information, go to: http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sharehold.html	Enroll in an MBA program. Attend his annual meeting.

To be a part of any circus, you should be highly capable physically. Before you join in the clowning about, practice your flexibility for a few months. If you're interested in trapeze or aerial silk, make sure to stretch every day and practice flexibility exercises. Eat healthy foods, and stay as physically active as you can.; , Circuses usually require auditions, and you should build a repertoire. Look into things like acrobatics, diabolo, unicycle, and trampolining. Once you've picked something to study, get equipment for it and begin practice. Build a bit of a show, perhaps with a theme for entertainment value, to attract possible employers and for use in auditions.  Some performance attire can be revealing, tight-fitting, or simply wacky. Make sure you have the right costume for you, and that it fits your act. For example, you wouldn't want long, flowing sleeves for fire dancing.  In the circus, you have to do everything yourself with no help from a makeup attendant. So purchase and collect your own makeup. Good things to use are shiny eyeshadow and diamond studs. If your show has a theme, play off of it. For example, a show based around fire might involve brightly colored makeup.  Yours may vary based on your act and your own personality. Some performers may opt for a sexy, one-sided smile, but a friendly grin can also warm the hearts of your audience.  The circus is a crowded environment by nature, and you may not have much time alone. If you can't stand the thought, consider performing in another setting.	Get into shape. Choose an act. Find a good costume. Make sure your makeup is pixel perfect. Practice your smile. Consider the realities of circus life.
It is illegal to possess, produce, or use counterfeit money; if a prosecutor can prove that you have intent to defraud, federal law can punish you with a fine and maximum 20 years in prison.   If it is passed to you, do not pass the counterfeit currency on to anyone other by following these instructions. Inspect bills the moment you are suspicious. Remember who gave you which bills. If you acquire a counterfeit banknote, you must turn it into the Secret Service. Not reporting counterfeit banknotes makes you vulnerable to someone else turning you in for counterfeit banknotes.  If possible, delay whoever passed you the counterfeit money to remember as much about that person’s appearance as possible. Take note of any accomplices or companions. Write down their license plate number if applicable.   The person who gives you counterfeit money might not be the original counterfeiter. They too might be an innocent civilian duped into using fake money. It might be impossible to match each passer to each specific bill, so many people inspect bills the moment they are handed to them. For example, many cashiers at general stores will inspect large denomination bills before accepting them as payment. This way, the cashier in the moment can link any potential passer to any potentially counterfeit bill.  Find your local police department or United States Secret Service field office. These numbers can be found on the inside front page of your local telephone directory or through online search.  Carefully place it in a protective covering, such as an envelope or sandwich bag. This is so that authorities can glean as much information as possible from the banknote: fingerprints, compounds and chemicals, how it was printed, and so on. This is also so that you cannot forget which banknote was forged, and others are not mistaken.  Write your initials and the date in the white border areas of the suspect banknote, or on the envelope/bag. The date identifies when the counterfeit was noticed, and your initials identify who noticed the counterfeit.  When you hand in a counterfeit note, you must fill out the Department of Homeland Security’s Counterfeit Note Report. Find the form here. The URL is http://www.secretservice.gov/forms/ssf1604.pdf.   Once a note is handed in with this form, it is considered counterfeit unless proven otherwise. Fill out 1 form for each suspected banknote. This form is geared towards banks who catch counterfeit money, but individuals should use it as well. If you found the counterfeit bill at a bank and you are an employee of the bank, contact your manager and fill out this form regarding your employer.  Surrender the note or coin only to a properly identified police officer or a U.S. Secret Service special agent. When asked, relay as much information as possible about the passer, accomplices, or any other information you remember about receiving the counterfeit money.   You will not be financially reimbursed for handing in counterfeit money. This is to prevent individuals from receiving money for free, just because they counterfeited money.	Do not create counterfeit money. Remember the passer. Contact the authorities. Avoid handling the banknote. Write down your information. Fill out the Secret Service counterfeit report. Give the banknote to authorities.
Over time, you can increase your vocal range by stretching one note (or one half-note) higher and lower than what you can sing comfortably. Focus on proper breathing while singing. Keep your air supply steady so that the note doesn't crack or become airy.Don't do too much too fast, as you can hurt your voice. Carey purportedly has a 5-octave range. While that range is impossible for most people, you can probably reach 3 octaves, especially with the help of an expert., Make a grunting noise ("uh-uh") then switch to singing a note with the word "mom." This activity shortens your vocal cords, which makes it easier to hit the high notes., Arpeggios go up and then down (do-mi-sol-do-sol-mi-do, in solfege syllables, or 1-3-5-8-5-3-1, in terms of scale degrees), modulating a half step up after each arpeggio. They can help increase the top half of your range., A voice teacher can help you improve your technique, so that you can comfortably increase your range.Your voice teacher may have you do some of these same exercises. However, the benefit of having a teacher around is that he or she can hear when you're making a mistake and work to correct it. As an amateur, you may not know when you are making a mistake, and so you may let it develop into a bad habit.	Gradually sing notes higher and lower. Try compressed grunts. Use octave arpeggio exercises. Take vocal lessons.
If you can't find a desk or a table to duck under, you have options. Although this method is disputedby many of the world's leading earthquake safety officials, it could save your life in the event that a building you're in collapses.  The triangle of life theory is that people who find shelter near, not under, household items such as sofas are often protected by voids or spaces created by a pancake collapse. Theoretically, a collapsing building would fall on top of a sofa or desk, crushing it but leaving a void nearby. Devotees of this theory suggest that sheltering in this void is the safest bet for earthquake survivors.  Doug Copp, the main proponent and proponent of the triangle of life theory, says that this safety technique is natural for dogs and cats and can work for you, too.  If you can't find a safe place to duck nearby, cover your head and get into the fetal position wherever you are.    Do not: Go under a doorway. People under doorways are commonly crushed to death if the door jamb falls under the weight of the earthquake's impact. Go upstairs to get under a piece of furniture. Stairs and staircases are dangerous places to tread during an earthquake, as they could collapse or break without notice.  The triangle of life technique is controversial. If you find yourself with several options about how to proceed during an earthquake indoors, attempt the drop, cover, and hold technique.   There are several problems with the triangle of life technique. First, it's difficult to know where triangles of life form, since objects in a quake move up and down as well as laterally. Second, scientific studies tell us that most deaths in earthquakes are linked to falling debris and objects, not falling structures.The triangle of life is predominantly based on earthquakes that cause structures, not objects, to fall. Many scientists believe that it's also more likely to sustain injuries trying to move somewhere instead of staying put.The triangle of life theory advocates moving to safe areas over staying put.	Use the triangle of life method as an alternative to drop, cover, and hold on. Find a structure or piece of furniture nearby. Huddle in the fetal position next to the structure or piece of furniture. Consider this list of what not to do in the event of an earthquake. Know that the triangle of life method is unsupported by scientific findings and/or expert consensus.
If you choose the latter, you have to make clear what the advantages and disadvantages is. The advantage is that the creative side is all up to you! The disadvantages is that it will require a lot of skill from your side to handle the instruments and vocal all by yourself. But it can be done, take for example Burzum, Nortt or Xasthur.; , There are really no limits of how few or many you can be. A good amount will be 3-4, with a drummer, at least one guitarist, a bassist and a vocalist. The vocalist can of course play guitar or bass too. Sometimes even the drummer can be the vocalist.  The vocals in black metal are mostly mid- to high pitched. Depends on what you want to sound like.  Heavy distortion is a must; get a distortion pedal or an amp with the ability to turn up the gain. They should know how to play in 16th notes (also called tremolo notes).  He should also have a double pedal or two singles with 2 base-drums. China cymbals give you a good sound as well as bells. Blastbeats are essential in black metal, because they create the "wall of sound" effect. Remember not to blast all the time, unless you want to sound like Marduk. If you haven't got a drummer, get a drum-program and at least some basic knowledge about rhythm.  The bass and drums are the foundation of your music. In heavy metal music, it is more common for bass parts to be more rhythmical. It would be good to have a bassist who can play a variety of different styles. Don't underestimate the importance of the bassist. One final note, your bassist should have a good "music ear". It is more difficult to hear the pitch of lower notes.  Some use them only to create atmosphere, other almost rely on keyboards (ie. Dimmu Borgir).  Black metal lyrics usually concentrate on topics like life, death, hate, nature and religion. Satanic lyrics are not essential, but you can write whatever you want. Just remember that black metal lyrics are very serious, and are some of the deepest and most contemplative lyrics found in music.  Make something up, and use it. Avoid using names like "Satanik Pervertor", those are stupid. Also, if you choose a name in another language (e.g. Latin or Norwegian), be sure you know the meaning of it. Cities or districts with significance can be used (Whitechapel, for example, where the Jack The Ripper murders took place). You can also invent a new word to use as a name. If you think this is difficult, you can try to use a random word generator, such as NameDice.com, to get some ideas. In this case you should also find out if you invented a word that already exists in another language, or if it is a company or brand name and should not be used for that reason. It could be a good idea to Google for the name you choose before you start using it.  You can do it yourself, or you can get somebody else to do it. Again, the options are endless. There are some articles here on wiki-how you can use, just get inspired and be creative.  A lot of black metal bands dress up in corpsepaint, leather, Boots, Jackets, spikes etc, but this is not necessary. Do what you want.  There's really no advice here. Make up some good riffs and lyrics, and record it.  This is the result of musicians not having enough money to record it properly, or someone who just wants to stay "true". Try to get a decent quality, but avoid the polished sound of fx Dimmu Borgir. You can record in your room, in a basement, in a forest, whatever, it doesn't matter. ,,	First off, you should consider if you want this to be a full band or a one man project. If you choose to make this a real band, you should find your band members. The vocalist will have to be able of snarling (also called shrieking) and maybe growling too. Your guitarists should tune their guitar in either classical tuning (E) or D. Remember, this is not meant to be played as deep as death metal. The drummer should most preferably know how to blastbeat at a fast pace. Find a good bassist that has good timing. Some black metal bands use a keyboard to have different sounds integrated in their songs. An important part of black metal is the lyrics. A good name is also important, and the options here are endless. To accompany the band name, create a logo. Appearance is not everything. Write a song. A lot of black metal recordings are of poor quality. That's pretty much all you need to know, but if you need some more info about black metal, look around on Wikipedia and Google, then you'll find some.  , Don't negotiate or come to terms.  , Never bargain with your stuff...just release it!
Trigger capos work by using a spring-loaded clamp to hold their tension. This clamp is simply is squeezed to open and close the capo. Players like trigger capos because they can be quickly and easily repositioned using just one hand, making them great for live performances.         This is the recommended type of capo for beginners, as it is simple and easy to use.; , Screw capos work using an adjustable knob that can be screwed to your desired amount of pressure. The downfall about screw capos is their impracticality – it's hard to do a live show when you have to keep screwing and unscrewing your capo in place. However, these capos are sometimes preferred when recording music because of the amount of control they give the guitar player., This design combines the speed of a trigger capo with the precision of a screw capo. Shubb capos use a simple lever, which can be adjusted for tension, and can easily be flipped on or off. Though they’re more expensive than the previous capos mentioned, they are very popular amongst seasoned guitar players., The G7th performance capos have become a favorite amongst many guitar players, as they are gentle, practical, and give the player great control. These capos allow for easy tension adjustment – all you need to do is squeeze it down over the desired location, and the G7th performance capo automatically locks in place. To release the capo, all you have to do is flip a lever.Some reviews claim that this capo is actually better at preserving the tone of your guitar as well.  Set your guitar on your lap, or place it around your shoulders using your guitar strap. You should position your guitar how you would typically play it, even if you were not using a capo. Hold your capo in your fretting hand so you can easily clip it in place.  Using a capo raises the key one half-step for every fret. If you place the capo on the first fret, the new key will be one half-step higher. If you place the capo on the second fret, the new key will be two half-steps higher. This continues with every fret.         For a specific example, let's use a standard E tuning. Say you've placed a capo on the third fret. The E strings become Gs (three half steps higher in pitch than E). All the strings become three half steps higher in pitch once the capo is applied — B becomes D; G becomes Bb; D becomes F; and A becomes C. If you're reading a tab sheet, the tab will typically tell you which fret to place your capo on.(Example: Capo 4, meaning capo on the fourth fret).  There are a few kinds of capos that operate slightly differently, though they essentially do the same thing. All have two thick rubber paddings that clamp down on the strings of your guitar. The longer side of the capo that comes in contact with the strings is the front. The back of the capo is usually shorter and clamps down on the back of the guitar neck.  If you place your capo on the wrong part of your guitar, it can easily become out of tune. The capo should be placed in the fret, just behind the fret bar. Do not leave a large space between the capo and the fret bar, but don't place it directly on top of the fret bar either.          If you place the capo too far back in the fret, it may cause your guitar to go sharp., Once you place a capo on your guitar, only the strings below the capo will be in the new raised key. The section below the capo is the part of the neck closer to the body of your guitar. The section above the capo is the part of the neck closer to the head and tuning pegs of the guitar. Be sure to only play below the capo once you've placed it on your guitar.         All of the chords you play below the capo will sound like they're in a higher key. Play the chords as you normally would.  Many guitarists choose to clip their capo on the head of their guitar during a live performance so that it is easily accessible throughout their show. This allows the guitarist to easily use the capo for some songs and take it back off for others.  All voices are different, so the original keys of some songs may not be a fit for every singer. Capos come in handy when you have to find a new key of a song for a singer. Using a capo will allow you to play the song in the new key without having to learn entirely new chords., A guitar capo can do much more than simply change the key of a song, it can create an entirely different sonic experience. For example, playing in the key of A with and without a capo will have entirely different feels even though you're playing in the same key, so experiment with your capo to hear the differences. Essentially, you'll be suing different voicing to play the same chords, which produce entirely different sounds.	Use a trigger capo. Try using a screw capo if you want greater control over your capo's pressure against the strings. Buy a Shubb capo. Invest in a premium capo. Hold your guitar and capo in the proper position. Place your capo on the desired fret. Open the capo and clamp it down in the fret, slightly behind the fret bar. Place your capo properly on the neck of your guitar. Play below the capo. Use your capo in a live performance. Find the best key for a singer. Use a capo to get a different timbre.
Don't let any emotions show on your face.(Except for boredom and disinterest); , Talk only when absolutely necessary, and make sure it's intelligent. Use as few words as possible without being unclear.  If you're not exactly born a genius, study hard but don't show it to anyone. Surprise people by getting the highest grade in exams or tests without looking like you're spending sleepless nights studying for it.  Don't smile or get flustered under all the attention.  Do anything you want without making any noise. Sleep if you want to.  When he does, he hides his face from view before laughing silently or smirking in amusement.  Whenever someone is talking to Shin he looks off to the side or in another direction.  If your hair is messy or tousled, let it be. , It's part of learning how to be independent. If you can't, try to be distant from them, without being impolite.  When grown-ups are annoying the hell out of you, give them a glare, roll your eyes, before walking lazily away.  Especially when it comes to dealing with nosy, know-it-all people.  Don't let every bad incident get under your skin. Shrug it off and move on.  People may not agree with the way you're dealing with things so learn to be firm with what you believe in and ignore them.  Learn not to trust people that easily. Be rude to them if you must.Place a wall between you and the people around you. But learn to put down your blinders to people who prove themselves worthy.  Do not ignore your friends when they speak to you.  Learn to accept that even the person you hate may make some fine point against what your friend did.  Act indifferent but show your care in the most subtle way (like saving her skin when she's in deep trouble)	Be stoic. Stay quiet. Shin is the smartest kid in their school, yet he doesn't care about his grades. If you DID manage to get the top score and was praised or teased by classmates of friends, show indifference. If you can, pick the farthest seat in the classroom and sit there. Shin rarely smiles. Rarely look people in the eye. Be confident and learn not to care about how you look. Care for your friends in a quiet way.  , Move out of your parents' house and live alone. Choose the people you're gonna be nice to. Be sarcastic. Be careful not to lose your composure. Stand up for yourself. Be cautious. Know what is going on. Don't be biased. When you find a girl/boy that caught your undivided attention/interest, stay calm and don't act like a love-sick dork.
This will protect the surface from spray paint and primer stains. Make sure the whole surface is covered with newspaper., Do this if you are re-using an old mason jar. Then wash it with soap and water. Dry the jar with a clean, dry towel.You only need to rinse and dry new jars with water and a clean towel.  Spray the entire surface of the jar with the primer until it is completely coated. Before purchasing your primer, check the back of the spray can to confirm that the primer is suitable for glass surfaces., Before you begin spraying, shake the can.

Scare him by pretending to go shopping for expensive gifts you want him to buy for you. This is especially effective if your relationship is still new. When you plan dates with your boyfriend, tell him to take you to a fancy restaurant. Act like you aren’t being spoiled but it’s your right to demand expensive dinners., Make him your personal chauffeur for a few hours or a day. Get him to wait for you in the car and not do anything else but be at your beck and call. Just when you know he's about to reach his limit, text or call him and let him know that it was a joke. Don't go overboard and make him resent you.  After a long day of getting him to run around for you, don’t give him a chance to get romantic or close to you. Tell him to take you home so that you can sleep. Once you see that he's annoyed, show him that you are considerate of him.  Cancel plans with your boyfriend and tell him that it's because you have to go out with your friends. Make sure that you don't cancel anything important and that you don't go too far and make him feel alienated.  Pretend to get irritated for the smallest reasons and be bitchy. If he thinks it's PMS affecting you, pretend to pick a fight about how he doesn't understand you and knows nothing about women.   Don't go over the top and make him question your character. Make it clear that you are exaggerating.  Nothing can ever be enough for you. He buys you roses, you want chocolate. He hugs you twice a day, you want him to hug you 3 times a day. He talks to you for 1 hour, you want him for 3. Sarcasm and tone are effective to convey feign displeasure.	Tell him that you’re a princess and deserved to be treated that way. Get him to drive you around. End your time with him abruptly. Go out with your friends. Make a fuss about everything. Always want more.
A lot can go a long way, so you only need about 1 to 2 tsp (5 to10 ml) of ketchup, at most.   Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results. Tomato juice is a mild acid, so the use of tomato-based products can help dissolve debris causing tarnish and dullness on your brass. Ketchup is your best option since it is so thick, but in the absence of ketchup, you could also try tomato paste or tomato juice.  Wipe the sides of the brass object down with the ketchup-covered cloth, coating all sides in the ketchup.   For best results, rub the ketchup on in a single direction instead of rubbing it on in a back-and-forth motion or a circular motion.  Use a damp cloth to wipe off the ketchup after allowing the tomato substance to sit on the surface for a couple of minutes.   You could also rinse the brass under running water to get the ketchup off, but using a damp cloth provides the added benefit of a little extra buffing.  Use a dry, soft cloth to dry off any remaining moisture while giving the brass a final shine. Thoroughly buff the entire surface by passing over it in small, circular motions.	Squirt a dollop of ketchup onto a soft cloth. Rub the surface of the brass with the ketchup. Wipe off the residue. Buff until dry and shiny.
If you have ferns that are already growing in your garden, you likely won’t need to move them unless they’re showing signs of ill health. Ferns like lots of shade and moisture, and do well under the canopy of a few other larger plants or trees. Plant (or transplant) ferns onto a plot that gets northern sun and no direct sunlight. If ferns are left in an area with direct sunlight, their leaves will burn.  If it does not rain regularly in your area, you’ll need to water your ferns on a daily basis so that the soil is kept moist. Add a dense layer of pine needle or leaf mulch to the tops of your ferns; about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) thick is ideal. This will help to lock in moisture and keep the rate of evaporation relatively low, so that the air near the ferns is a bit more humid.  Six months after the original planting, you can begin fertilizing the ferns for added growth. Select an organic fertilizer that is spray-on, and apply it to the ferns (following package directions). Additionally, you can add a layer of compost and mulch to the soil to create a better growing environment for the ferns. Do keep in mind that ferns have a lesser requirement of fertilizer than other common houseplants.  Ferns don’t have many natural predators outdoors, other than slugs and one or two rare diseases. If, however, you notice that your fern has damaged or diseased fronds, use a pair of gardening shears to cut them back. This will keep the integrity of the rest of the plant, and if it is a disease, prevent it from spreading to other plants.  Ferns can get quite large over time, and require splitting and transplanting. To divide a large fern into several smaller ferns, carefully dig out the plant and its roots. Carefully break apart the plant into sections; typically, the fern will grow in clumps making it easy to split. Then replant each of these, and water them well.	Plant ferns in the ideal location. Keep the soil moist. Fertilize the ferns once a month. Cut back damaged fronds. Transplant if necessary.
Note that you can purchase the clay in any color you please, but black is the traditional color of runes. It may become a bit dull after baking, so you may as well pick up paint to match.; , This will be the same size as your Rune, so make sure you're happy with the size before proceeding.  With a small, sharp knife, cut thin and shallow lines around the picture. Do not cut all the way through just yet. Be as precise as possible and cut close to the picture.  Get the outer lines, the insides of the curves, and inside the diamond. It won't be perfect at first, so cut away all the loose outer edges. Take note that the back of the rune is supposed to be left flat for stability. Smooth over the Rune once you're done cutting- you can use a little water to seal cracks shut.  Make sure that the hole is big enough for a chain or string of your choice to fit through. Alternatively, you can purchase a jewelry kit and use the items in it. , Add extra detail to it if you like, such as paint or a glossy finish (like clear nail polish).	Gather the things listed in the "Things You'll Need" section. Cut out the picture. Lay the picture out on a flat, smooth bit of clay. Take the picture off and cut all the way through the clay on the lines. Puncture a small hole between where the two lines extend outwards. Bake the Rune in an oven at whatever temperature the clay's package says.  , Take the Rune out when it's done baking and put it on a chain or string.
You can either buy a tachometer new, which usually run somewhere between $30 and $50, or salvage on old one for relatively cheap and install it into your car.   The only other specialty item you'll need to complete the job is a package of quick-splice connectors, which are usually only a few dollars at the auto part store. The wires are about 16-18 gauge usually, so get connectors of the appropriate size.; , New tachometers may be set to work on 4-, 6- or 8- cylinder engines by removing the back cap of the tachometer to reveal the cylinder setting switches inside.Set the cylinder switches to match the number of cylinders in your engine. Replace the end cap of the tachometer carefully to avoid pinching any of the internal tachometer wires. Use a screwdriver to refasten the end cap if necessary. Generally, there will be two switches--a 1 and a 2. Most of the time, both switches should be down for a 4 cylinder engine, while both should be up for an 8 cylinder. In a 6 cylinder engine, most of the time the 2 switch should be up and the 1 should be down. If you get a new tachometer, read the instructions to be sure.  Depending on your engine, there may be a constant-flow wire and a pulse wire to the tach, as well as the additional wires for the ignition, lights, and other components. It's important to make sure you've got the correct wire for the tachometer, which means you might need to use a multimeter with a tach setting to test the wires correctly, and consult the shop manual for your engine.   It's also important to note that some new tachometers are incompatible with solid-core spark plug wires and can be dangerous to connect without following the proper installation instructions for the tach.  Before you mount it in the steering column, it's a good idea to hook up the wiring and and test it out while you rev the engine, to make sure it works. You don't want to go drilling holes in your steering column before you're sure you've got the wiring figured out. After you hook it up to the proper wires from the distributor and ground it correctly, it should give you an accurate reading of your RPMs as you rev the engine.   Ground the tachometer. Attach the tachometer ground wire to an engine ground of the car. This need not be directly on the battery. Much of the car frame is grounded to the battery by sturdy wires. Trace those wires to find a suitable attachment point. Attach the tachometer pickup wire. The tachometer wire must be fed through a grommet in the passenger compartment to reach the engine compartment. This attachment point will vary from engine to engine.  Most cars won't have an in-dash mounting location available, so it's usually best to mount your tach on the steering column.   Drill holes in the steering column and use the mounting bracket supplied with the tachometer, or rig your own. Directions for mounting typically are provided with new tachometers, as well as any necessary pieces.       Bracket mount the tachometer on the steering column. Fabricate or find a secure mounting bracket that will support the tachometer mounting points. Attach the bracket to the steering column. A simple U bracket would suffice for this.  Apply power to the tachometer by attaching the power input wire of the tachometer to the 12-volt dashboard lighting supply of the car.   Provide power to the tachometer backlighting. Locate the 12-volt switched dash lighting supply for the dashboard on the car fuse box. Attach the tachometer backlighting wire.  It's a good idea to install a rubber grommet where the wire(s) pass through the firewall as part of your installation. If the wires rub up against the bare metal, it can cause a fire hazard or at least a short. It's best to be on the safe side and work a grommet in, which will only cost a few dollars and take a few minutes at the most.  This light will remind you that it is recommended to change gears at the current RPM. Not all tachometers have the shift light feature. If your chosen tachometer does, follow the installation instructions to properly set the shift light. The shift light cannot be set if the engine is running.	Get a tachometer and splicing connectors. Adjust the tachometer for the number of cylinders in your engine. Locate the output wire from your distributor. Test the connection. Choose a mounting location for the tachometer. Install the tachometer. Install a grommet in the firewall. Set the shift light on the tachometer if applicable.
The buildup of gunk on strainers and stoppers often causes slow drainage. Remove any screws around the strainer with the proper screwdriver. Then, place the screws in a safe location while you clean the strainer. Stopper are easier to remove because they are not held down with any screws, so simply remove the stopper by twisting and lifting it.Most bathtub drains have either a strainer or a stopper. This method is usually effective on small clogs, so if your drain is badly clogged, it may not be as effective.  A lot of gunk may have accumulated on the strainer or stopper. Clean any hair or soap scum; you may have to scrub the strainer and stopper.  Strainers will need to be re-screwed back onto the top of the drain, whereas you can just place the stopper back in the drain.  Turn on your bathtub to see if the drain now works properly. If not, you will need to try another method.	Remove the strainer. Clean excessive gunk around the strainer and stopper. Replace the cover or stopper the same way you removed it. See if it worked.
Push down as much as your fingers can go.; ,, During this time, the added nutrients leaching from the pellets will give the succulents that added boost that they need to keep going until you get around to re potting them.  Eventually the goodness from the pellets will disappear and you will need to re pot the succulents. Do so at your soonest convenience.	Push some plant or sheep pellets down the side of each potted succulent. Water well.  , Leave for a few more months. Replant when you can.
To make this type of bioplastic, you will need cornstarch, distilled water, glycerol, white vinegar, a stove, a saucepan, a silicone spatula, and food coloring (if desired). These items should be readily available at the grocery store or online. Glycerol is also called glycerine, so try searching for that if you’re having trouble finding glycerol.The following amounts of each ingredient are needed to make the bioplastic:10ml distilled water 0.5-1.5g glycerol 1.5g cornstarch 1ml of white vinegar 1-2 drops food coloring Adult supervision is recommended.; , Add all of the ingredients to the saucepan and stir to combine with the spatula. Stir until you get rid of most of the lumps in the mixture. At this stage, the mixture will be a milky white color and quite watery.If you add the wrong amounts of ingredients, just dispose of the mixture and start again.  Place the saucepan on the stove and set the heat to medium-low. Stir continuously as the mixture heats. Bring it to a gentle boil. As the mixture heats, it will become more translucent and begin to thicken.Remove the mixture from the heat when it becomes clear and thick. Total heating time will be around 10-15 minutes. Lumps may begin to form if the mixture gets overheated. Add one-two drops of food coloring at this stage, if you would like to color the plastic.  Spread the heated mixture onto a piece of foil or parchment paper to let it cool. If you would like to mold the plastic into a shape, it must be done while it is still warm. See the last method for details on molding the plastic.   Remove any bubbles that you see by poking them with a toothpick.  It will take time for the plastic to dry and harden. As it cools, it will begin to dry out. Depending on the thickness of the plastic, it can take longer for it to dry. If you make one small thick piece it will take longer to dry than a thinner larger piece.Leave the plastic in a cool, dry place for this process. Check the plastic after two days to see if it has fully hardened.	Gather the necessary materials. Combine all of the ingredients and stir together. Heat on medium-low. Pour the mixture onto foil or parchment paper. Allow the plastic to dry for at least two days.
Take a deep breath, drawing in as much air as possible.   The actual practice of throwing your voice is also known as the “distant effect” because it makes your voice sound as though it comes from a distance. In order to throw your voice, you will need to rely on the pressure that comes from squeezing a large amount of air out through narrow passageways. As such, taking a large amount of air into your lungs is an essential first step. Practice inhaling deeply without appearing and sounding obvious. Take large yet quiet breaths through your nose to avoid the “gasping” sound that comes from inhaling deeply through your mouth.; , Position the back of your tongue so that it nearly touches your soft palate.   The soft palate is the soft portion of the roof of your mouth, located near your throat. Use the back of your tongue rather than the tip. Your tongue should be near your soft palate without actually touching it. This action closes off most of your throat. The opening of your throat will need to be narrowed like this in order to produce the muffled voice required for this effect.  Pull your stomach in to tighten your diaphragm and apply pressure below your lungs.   The diaphragm is a muscle located directly below your lungs. It plays a role in inhalation and exhalation, and the deepest breaths you take are those for which you use your diaphragm. Since the diaphragm is located directly below the lungs and around the upper stomach area, tightening or straining the muscles in your midsection will also tighten your diaphragm. Placing pressure below your lungs constricts the passageway from your lungs to your mouth and nasal cavities. This constriction grants you greater control over your voice and is essential to trapping it inside your throat.  Slowly exhale, making a groaning noise as your breath leaves your throat.   By keeping your airways constricted, you will trap your breath around your larynx. The resulting groan is locked inside your throat, making it sound distant. Practice groaning in this manner several times until you feel comfortable about how trapped or distant the groaning sounds. Inhale deeply each time and constrict your muscles in the same manner, resting your throat when it begins feeling strained or pained.  Repeat the inhaling and constricting techniques you used to control your groans. Instead of letting out a low groan, use a simple yet open sound like "ahh."   The "ahh" should be long. Start the sound as soon as you begin exhaling and continue it until you push all the air out of your lungs. Note that the sound does not need to be loud, though. If anything, you should expect that the sound will seem muffled, since that is part of what makes it sound so distant. As you practice more, you can gradually work on making the sound louder. To start with, however, merely focus on trapping the noise in your throat. Continue practicing this technique, making the "ahh" sound, until you feel comfortable with it. Stop if your throat begins to feel sore or pained.  When you feel comfortable throwing the "ahh" sound, repeat the breathing and constricting techniques, replacing the "ahh" with a couple of words like "help me."   "Help me" is a common phrase used in ventriloquism, since throwing one's voice is often used when creating the illusion of a talking puppet trapped in a chest or box. You could use other phrases, though, like "let me out" or "over here!" The words you choose are up to you, but it is best to keep them simple since throwing your voice strains your muscles. Repeat this phrase as often as necessary until you feel comfortable with the resulting sound.  Your practices should be no longer than 5 minutes at most.   Stop as soon as you feel any pain or severe strain in your throat or lungs. Your larynx, vocal cords, and throat in general are being worked in unusual ways. To avoid damaging or severely straining them, your practice sessions need to be short and focused. As you gain experience, you may be able to practice for slightly longer periods, but your practice sessions should always be fairly short.  The three basic lip positions used when throwing your voice are the relaxed position, smile position, and open position.Create the relaxed position by slightly parting your lips. Keep your jaw loose so that your upper and lower rows of teeth are separated instead of held together. The smile position is common in a ventriloquist act, but it is not used quite as often as the relaxed and open positions in producing the "distant effect." Create the smile position by holding your jaw and lips apart for the relaxed position. Exert the muscles at the corners of your lips, pulling your lips into a slight smile. Your lower lip will extend out slightly more than it would for a usual smile. The open position is great when trying to express shock or surprise, but some tongue movement might be spotted. Hold your mouth agape so that the separation between your upper and lower jaws is noticeable. Keep the corners of your lips slightly upturned, essentially creating a more open version of the smile position.  The easy sounds can be produced with little to no jaw movement. Practice each of these sounds in front of a mirror until you feel comfortable making them without excess mouth movement.   The long and short versions of all five vowels, A, E, I, O, and U, are included among the easy sounds. The hard and soft C sounds and hard and soft G are also among the easy sounds. Other easy sounds include D, H, J, K, L, N, Q, R, S, T, X, and Z.  Challenging sounds, also known as labials, are made using an altered tongue position known as the "front press" or "pull off" position.   You usually produce sounds like B and M by momentarily closing your lips, but this movement is obvious and makes it difficult to convince others that the speech comes from a source other than your mouth. Using the "front press" position, your tongue acts as a substitute for one lip. Briefly touch the tip of your tongue to the back of your teeth, applying a light amount of pressure. Make this movement every time your lips would naturally close together to produce a sound. Use this technique for the B, M, P, F, and V sounds. Note that these sounds will not sound as they normally do, but the altered versions produced by this technique are the closest you can come without moving your lips. Do not use much pressure and do not touch the tongue to the roof of your mouth. If you do this, your B will sound like D and your M will sound like N.  One way to misdirect those listening to you is to pretend that you are searching for the sound in the same way they might be searching.   Contrary to the way it may seem, throwing your voice does not mean that you will be able to "bottle" your voice and make it sound as though it is coming from a specific location. A close observer will clearly discover that the voice originates from you, even if you master the technique.Successfully throwing your voice relies on your ability to momentarily convince your audience or listener to look elsewhere for the sound of the voice. People have a natural tendency to look off in directions that others look off in. By appearing as though you are "searching" for the source of the voice, you can cause many people to follow your eyes with their own, effectively joining you in your "search" for the source.  After you finish “searching” for the source of the voice, a good way to keep the listener misdirected is by keeping your eyes locked on the fake source.   This action relies on the same misdirection principle used in searching for your fake source. Human curiosity causes people to look in the same direction that others are looking in. By fixing your gaze on an object or location, those listening to you will naturally follow your line of sight to that object or spot. They may break out of it the longer the illusion lasts, but their initial reaction will be to look where you look.  Enhance the illusion by responding to your “thrown” words as though you were another person.   If you are saying something shocking or surprising, make gestures that indicate such an emotion. Raise your eyebrows, quickly cover your mouth with your hand in a phony gasp, or slap your hand to your forehead in mock disbelief. Similarly, if you are listening to words that should anger you, cross your arms, turn your back to the source, or use other gestures to mimic the emotion of anger.	Inhale. Raise your tongue. Exert pressure with your diaphragm. Let out a groan. Make an "ahh" sound. Replace the "ahh" with "help me!", Limit your practices. Control your lip movements. Practice the easy sounds. Work on the challenging sounds using the “front press” position. Search for the sound. Focus on one pretend source. Use nonverbal communication cues.
; , This end is the weakest part of the walnut.  Do this a few times and the prised open end should start to split, leaving the walnut in halves.  Cut it long enough to allow for the cradle to hang from a hook or tree branch.  Keep it balanced.  Wind a pipe cleaner around a pencil to make a coil.   The coiled pipe cleaner will give the impression of a baby's body beneath the cloth you'll add shortly.  Glue the bead at one end of the coil.  Cut a small rectangle from the scrap fabric.  Glue into place at one end of the walnut half.  Cut the scrap fabric into a narrowed down half circle shape, the same shape as the tapering of the walnut. This piece needs to be big enough to fit over baby's body and the lower part of the walnut shell.   This will be added to the cradle in the next section.  When adding, leave space at one end for the baby's head. Glue in place.   The head should sit up a little, as if the baby is looking up and out.  It should cover the body completely but stop underneath the baby's head; adjust as needed.   Glue all around the edges. This stops fraying from happening.  Use the fine marker to draw eyes and a smile. The eyes can show baby asleep or awake.   It's up to you whether you add more features, such as two nostrils for a nose or a little squiggle for "hair".  The walnut baby can now be hung on a tree branch, off a hook, or anywhere else. You can also rest the walnut baby on a shelf.   Make as many more as you please.	Rest the walnut on a cutting board. Use a knife or blade of a strong pair of scissors to insert into the round end of the walnut. Gently tap the walnut on the board. Cut a length of the narrow ribbon. Glue each end of the ribbon to either side of the walnut half. Make the body first. Add the head to the coil. Make a pillow first. Stuff a little wad of cotton wool or toy stuffing underneath it to form a pillow shape. Cut a blanket or duvet for the baby. Place the baby inside the walnut half. Glue the blanket or duvet scrap piece over the baby's body. Decorate baby's face. Done.
If you have an old, unused screen in storage, you could use this to salvage pieces from. However, if you are concerned about appearance of the screen, it is probably best to try to buy the same kind of screen, either nylon or aluminum, in the same color.; ,, Alternatively, make the thread as close a match as you can get or try fishing thread, which is invisible and very strong. A straight needle can be used if you have access to both sides of the screen, but it will be more difficult and time consuming.  If the screen is still in its window you can hold this repair piece in place temporarily with tape. If you have taken the screen off the window, perform the repair with the screen laying flat.  Take the threaded needle and "sew" by going through both layers of screen. Take small stitches, making sure to pull in all slack. The aim is to bring the two pieces as closely together as possible.  Tie off the thread with a strong knot, at least double tied. Ensure that there are no gaps where insects can get in.	Buy or salvage sufficient screen mesh to cover the entire tear. Cut the screen mesh the size of the hole in the torn screen, leaving a one inch (2.5 cm) margin on each side of the cut shape.  , Thread a curved upholstery needle with strong thread of the same color as the screen. Cover the tear with the patch of screen mesh that you have already cut. Stitch around the patch. Finish with a strong knot.
Decide what size you'd like the card to be and cut the cardboard accordingly. Fold into a card shape.; , You will need three differently sized hearts. Mark the sizes on the felt using a sewing pencil or similar marker. To get the proportions accurate, it is easiest to do this as follows:   Measure the largest heart in relation to the card size. Measure the medium heart against the large heart. Measure the smallest heart against the medium heart. This is a naive art style, so perfection is not required.  Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut neatly through the felt.  Glue each heart onto the heart under it. Add an embellishment, such as a button. Glue or sew it in place.  Allow to dry. Once dry, the card is ready to give. Simple as!   Write your message using a calligraphy pen, if wished.	Start by preparing the card. Measure the hearts. Cut out the heart shapes. Assemble into a pile of hearts before transferring to the card. Transfer to the card and glue into place on the card.
With the band done, you will want to add decorations in order to complete the look. A bow is a classic look for young girls and is simple to create. This may be a good place to start when creating your own baby headbands.   To make a bow, you will need ribbon. Try to get fabric ribbon, as plastic ribbon is not good for this purpose. Choose a ribbon that compliments the color of the band you have just created and appeals to your personal taste. There are several different types of bow. You can make one which is simple, like those used to tie shoes, or you can make one that is more complex, like those bought to go on presents. For the simple bow, tie a bow as normal. Take an extra inch or two of ribbon and wrap it around the center of the bow to hide the knot. Glue or sew this unto the band. For a more complex bow, take a roll of ribbon. Holding the end down, make a loop about two inches long and then hold that down. Reverse and do the same thing on the other side. Reverse and repeat until your bow looks full. Use a single stitch to keep it in place and then cover the center as before. Glue or stitch this to the band.  You may wish to go for a more floral look with your headband. This is a great look for little girls and will give her a fairy-like appearance. You can use one flower or glue multiple flowers together. You can use craft flowers, which look realistic, a simply glue them on or you can create your own from fabric.   Begin with foot-long, one inch wide strips of fabric. Try to use fabric which is contrasting but complementary to the band you have sewn. Any fabric type will do, including basic cottons. Glue this fabric around a pipe cleaner in a slightly uneven way. This will give the material a draped look. Roll the pipe cleaner into a rosette shape. If you are only using one, it may be possible to then glue the flower directly to your band. Otherwise, glue the flower or flowers into an arrangement on a piece of felt. Cut the felt to ensure that it is not visible when looking at the flowers from above and then glue the felt to the band.  For a more fabulous look, you can use sequins. These are easy to use and do not require you to make anything extra. They come in a variety of colors and sizes and can be attached to your band to create many different patterns. Try using varying sizes of the same color to achieve a different look.   Sequins can be sew on individually by stitching through the hole at the center or they can be glued to the band. Use whatever method is suited to your skill and what you feel looks best. You may wish to practice attaching them to scrap fabric first.  You can attach a variety of shapes to the headband as well. These can be items you have crafted yourself or they can be items purchased from a craft store. This can be a great way to let your little girl’s personality shine through. Choose items which tell people who she is. Stars, hearts, animals, or food items all make good shapes to put on the band.   You can make these shapes yourself, using felt. You can simply create the shape and cut it from one or more pieces of felt and glue that to the band, or you can use felting to create a 3D object to glue or stitch to the band. It simply depends on your skill and desire. You can also use novelty buttons or scrapbooking decorations to embellish your headband. Glue or sew these as necessary.	Create a Bow. Make a flower. Use sequins. Attach shapes.
Your final pattern will look like a rectangle, even if your pillow is a square. Start by measuring the length and width of your cushion. Double the length measurement, then add 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) to it. Next, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the width measurement. These will be the measurements for your pattern.For example, if your cushion is 16 by 16 inches (40.64 by 40.64 centimeters), your pattern will be 38 by 17 inches (96.52 by 43.18 centimeters). The two short ends will overlap by about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) when you are done.; , Draw a rectangle on a piece of fabric using your measurements. You can do this using dressmaker's chalk or pen. Once you have done that, cut the fabric out using a pair of fabric scissors.   You can use any type of fabric you want, but sturdy, upholstery fabric from the home decorating section of the fabric store will work the best.  Turn the rectangle so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you. Fold the narrow, side edges down by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) and press them flat with an iron. Fold them over by another ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter), and press them flat again.Use a heat setting that is suitable for the fabric that you are working with. Use sewing pins to help the fabric stay down while you are ironing it.  Use the straight stitch, and try to get as close to the bottom folded edge as possible. Pull out the sewing pins as you sew (if you are using them), and snip off any loose threads when you are done.  You can position the overlap right in the middle of your pillowcase, or you can offset it to the left or to the right. When you are done, the pillowcase should be the same width as your cushion.  Use a matching thread color and a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.To prevent the thread from unraveling, sew back and forth a few times across the start and end of your sewing. Remove the pins as you sew.  You can now tuck the cushion into the pillowcase.  Put the pillow wherever you want it.  Measure your cushion, then add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to the length and width.Cut out a piece of fabric according to that measurement. For example, if your pillow was 16 by 16 inches (40.64 by 40.64 centimeters), then your front piece will be 16½ by 16½ inches (41.91 by 41.91 centimeters).   You can use any type of fabric you want, but the thick, sturdy fabric from the home decorating section of the fabric store will work best.  For example, if your pillow was 16 by 16 inches (40.64 by 40.64 centimeters), then your piece will be 16½ by 20½ inches (41.91 by 52.07 centimeters). This will eventually be the back piece for your cushion.You can use the same color of fabric, or a contrasting color. You can also choose a solid color if your front piece had a pattern on it.  You will end up with two pieces that are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wider than your pillow, and several inches shorter.  Take one of the back pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you. Fold one of the long edges over by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) and press it flat with an iron. Fold it over by another ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter), and press it flat once more. Repeat this step for the other back piece.Use a heat setting on your iron that is suitable for the fabric you are working with. Use sewing pins to keep the fabric down as you are pressing it with the iron.  Try to get as close to the bottom folded edge as possible. If you used sewing pins, be sure to pull them out as you sew.  Turn the front piece so that the right side of the fabric is facing you. Place the two back pieces, right-side-down on top, with the hemmed edges facing towards the center. They will overlap by a few inches.  Use a ⅜-inch (0.95-centimeter) seam allowance.Remove the sewing pins as you go.  Snipping the corners will help reduce bulk, just be careful not to cut through your stitching!  ,	Measure your cushion and your pattern. Cut your fabric according to your measurements. Fold the narrow edges over twice by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) to make the hems. Stitch the hems down using a thread color that matches your fabric. Lay the fabric right-side-up on your work surface, then fold the hemmed edges towards each other until they overlap by 3 inches (7.62 centimeters). Pin the fabric in place, then sew along the top and bottom edges. Snip off any loose threads, then turn the pillowcase right-side-out. Finished. Cut out a sheet of fabric for the front piece of your pillowcase. Cut a piece of fabric that is ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wider than your pillow, and 4½ inches (11.43 centimeters) longer. Cut the back piece in half, widthwise. Fold one of the long edges over on each back piece twice to make the hem. Topstitch the hems down using a thread color that matches your fabric. Place the back pieces on top of the front piece. Pin the fabric in place, then sew along all four edges. Snip the corners and any loose threads off, then turn the pillow inside out.Finished
Consider why you are chopping this tree: perhaps it has become an obstruction in your yard; perhaps you need firewood for the winter; perhaps you want a Christmas tree. If you already have a tree in mind, then you'll need to evaluate whether it is feasible to chop down. If you don't own the land on which the tree grows, make sure that the landowner is okay with you removing it.   If you are chopping a tree down for utility, not to clear space, there may be multiple choices. The best tree will depend on what you intend to use it for: building planks, using as firewood, etc.; , If the tree is on your own property, then you can chop it down at your own discretion. You'll need to ask permission if the woods are on public land or on someone else's private land. Do not illegally chop down a tree.  You'll need to consider how tall the tree is and where it will fall. Discern whether the tree is leaning in any particular direction, and make sure that it won't fall onto any person or property. Decide what you'll do with the tree once you chop it. If you plan to move the tree, you'll need to let it fall somewhere that you can easily recover it. If you leave the tree where it falls, it will take some time for it to rot into the ground. In the meantime, it can serve as a home for beetles, roaches, ants, snakes, and other pests.   View the tree from all angles to ascertain if it leans in any one direction. If so, determine whether it will cause damage to fences, trees, driveways, sheds, or any surrounding property. You must also determine that it will not fall back across or against your house. Proceed only if it passes this test, and you still feel confident.  You can use an ax, which is a slower, more archaic method best suited to smaller trees. Many modern tree-cutters use a chainsaw, which is heavier-duty, but more expensive and arguably more dangerous. Your choice will be largely dependent upon which tools you have at your disposal. Only use a chainsaw if you are very comfortable using heavy-duty power tools.  Be extremely careful not to stand in the path of a falling tree, and make sure that there is no one—friends, neighbors, children, pets&mash;in the way when you make the cut. Consider wearing gloves, a helmet, goggles, and other safety gear. Remember: if the tree is large, it could easily kill you or a loved one when it falls.   Be aware of property damage. Make sure that the tree won't fall onto any buildings, vehicles, etc. If you are chopping a tree in the woods, make sure that you know where all members of your party are at all times. Make sure that you can safely remove the tree from the woods.  Use a chopping ax (not a splitting ax) or a large machete/knife. The size of the necessary ax depends on the size of the tree.  Tie it as tightly as you can to another tree, or big rock in the direction you want it to fall. (You may throw a cord with a weight on it over a limb and pull a rope up and figure out how to tie it.) Tie the rope to something that is farther away than the height of the tree, unless you don't care where the tree lands. Tie this rope tightly and make sure there are a couple of backup knots on it.   Avoid damaging any fence, building or vehicle.  Try to get a good "V" shape going on the side of the tree--remember, axes aren't saws; you cannot chop in a straight line.   Do not try to chop the wood straight. Wedge out little pieces on the side you want it to fall. You do not need to make it all the way through the tree on one side, just think about where it is best to chop it.  Keep your eyes and ears open, and be prepared to run out of the way Watch upward, and listen for cracking and groaning sounds. Cracking or groaning will tell you that the tree may be about to give way. As you chop, continue to glance upward into the tree for any swaying or leaning.  A tree can fall quickly and quietly, and it can easily catch you by surprise. If you are not paying attention, the tree could fell you!   Expect the tree to swing around as it falls. This is due to limbs or the slant of the tree, and due to your "guide" rope. Limbs of your tree may extend outward far enough to strike you. Stay out of the way. Watch for surrounding trees. The branches of other trees may become entangled or break, and you may find that other limbs and trees begin to fall around you.  You can rent small chainsaw with with an 18" bar at most hardware stores. These saws are normally 2 cycle engines which require a mixture of two cycle oil and gas. If you rent one, insist on them providing you with a full can if gasoline mixture. You will need what is called "bar oil", which goes into its own tank and lubricates the chain and the bar it is on. Finally, have then shop you how it starts, and ask them to check to make sure the chain is sharp.  If the tree is standing pretty straight, you will need to make a wedge cut.  Go to the front of the tree and start your saw. Let it run for a minute to warm up. If your chainsaw doesn't have an automatic oilier, make sure to push the oil button occasionally. Most modern saws do include an automatic oilier.   You never want the chain or bar to get dry under the heat. Bar oil is formulated to cling to the bar, and it will actually string from the bar it you touch your finger to it.  Rev the saw up about halfway. Hold it completely horizontal, then make a cut from the side in about 1/3 of the diameter of the tree. Then, go up about 3-4" above that cut: pick an imaginary line that will start above the 1st cut, and maintain 45 degrees all the way down, (an angle cut) to where the horizontal cut stopped. Go no further. This is your wedge piece, which you will need to remove.   You may need to knock the wedge piece loose with a sledgehammer. Knock it on the side, then the top, then the side again.  You can assist the tree in falling along your desired path by roping it and tying it securely with at least a 1/2" rope 2/3 of the way up the trunk. Then, hook that rope to a come-along hand-winch that's tied to a larger tree. Make sure that the larger tree is far enough away that your tree won't fall into it. As you start to cut the tree, have a friend begin to crank the come-along to maintain pressure toward your targeted zone.   Alternatively, you can use two wedges. Once your saw blade is well into the cut (far enough along so the wedges will not hit the bar of the saw) begin to drive them in equally behind the saw blade. Watch the tree as it is being cut. If it leans one way more than the other and that takes it off path, pound the wedge on that side in a bit more. Try to keep the wedges even so the tree falls evenly. Do not stand directly behind the tree. It can break loose from the trunk and "kick back", causing extreme damage or even death to the cutter(s).  Move to the back of the tree, and make sure the area where you stand is completely clear. Pick a horizontal, straight line that will intersect the top angle of the wedge cut you made – about 1/3 of the way from where it ends in the tree. As you cut, use a high engine speed, but don't push the saw too hard. Eventually as you near the intersection of the wedge cut the tree should begin to bend in the direction of the fall. Do not cut all the way through.  When the tree begins to fall, move out of the way and yell to anyone around to get out of the way. If the fall begins to slow, give it a little more cut until it resumes falling. It will normally break loose of the stump and lie on either side of the stump.  Lop the limbs off in the direction of the growth, and take a piece of chalk to mark where you want each cut made. Saw it up and remove it from the area!	Choose a tree. Know your rights. Plan ahead. Choose your chopping tool. Be safe. Find your chopping tool. Tie a rope to a high, thick branch on the tree. Start slowly with your chops. Be aware of the tree's stability. Get away quickly when it begins moving. Rent, buy, or borrow a chainsaw. Pick an area where you want the tree to fall. Start your saw. Make the first cut. Guide the tree as it falls. Fell the tree. Move away and yell "Timber!", De-Brush and remove the tree.
This will improve the effect that you have been changing over the break.; , They will think you are insane. If you follow these steps and act correctly, they will think they found out your "big secret"!  , Follow them, but don’t stalk them, to most places, and in dangerous situations, protect them. Since you are, unfortunately not an actual werewolf with any powers, ensure you do not put yourself or your friend in any danger.  If they wouldn't, then don't ask, as they would most likely think you are crazy and not be friends with you anymore.    If you can, play hooky on full moons and new moons. If people ask you where you were yesterday, act really worried and mumble some excuses.  Don't wear skirts or dresses. After a full moon, sprinkle a little dirt on your shirt and shoes. Only do this if your parents don't mind your clothes getting dirty. , Just keep your distance but remember to be friendly. , This will help you draw minimal attention to yourself, but if anyone notices you, you will look natural and beautiful. The dark eyeliner will make your eyes more intense and helps with giving defensive glares at people who might stare.  Wolves and werewolves are quite hairy. You don't have to shave, so a light coating on your arms and legs would work too.  If someone teases you, give them a look that says "No." and act defensive. A wolf would do the same, but wolves usually engage in a fight, which you should avoid at all costs.  Wolves are natural predators, and they are always moving and waiting. Improve your balance, grace, and patience to perfect the look of a wolf hunting prey. Though you can do this, make it minimal so people will not be freaked out that you are glaring at them hungrily and hunting them down.  This will improve your technique. Also, if you own a dog, watch how it plays, sleeps, eats, etc. , If someone invites you over after 7:00 or dusk, say you can't and that you have something to do. If they ask what, make up an activity that you could actually do, like "Oh, I am just going grocery shopping. It won't be much fun." White lies are okay in this situation, but try to never lie because it could get you into a heap of trouble.  Play Frisbee to help with reflexes.  Do the opposite if you're more of a pack kind of wolf. , Pretend to crave meat like crazy, but this is only optional.  Animals are almost all afraid of fire. Don't go near fire and if you see fire stare at it and snarl a little not too loud just loud enough that one or two people can hear it., Pretend to have a really keen sense of smell and scratch like you have picked up the odd flea from running around chasing deer at night.,	Make your attempts to act like a werewolf after a school break or some time off. Do not tell anyone that you are a werewolf. Find one person to become friends with or if you already have a good friend that works too. If you have a group of really good friends that you are sure would join in on the act, ask them if they could join you as your "pack" to make it more realistic. Ask your family to go camping on the nearest full moon, but don't let them in on the act of being a werewolf or they might send you to a psychiatrist or something. Wear forest colors like black, dark green, brown, navy blue, and a little white if necessary.Act really tired and hungry but strong the day after a full moon,  , Avoid people but don’t become a friendless psycho!, Pretend to be vulnerable, weak, and frustrated with your "lack of strength" on new moons.  , Wear natural makeup and black eyeliner. Don't shave. Stand your ground. Always move. Watch wolves in a zoo or go on YouTube and view some wolf videos. Don’t get a costume, because it will probably make you look fake and cheesy.  , Avoid being around people on full moon nights, and act concerned the whole day and don't worry too much about other problems; you have your own.

Focus on the lines. Write them down, as this helps you to remember them. Then, say the lines out loud for as many times as you think is needed to be able to repeat them in your sleep.  Compare their normal personalities to how they perform in the play. Look at their hand movements, and how they declaim their speeches. This will help you discover the tricks and ways that allow you to change your normal personality into the one in the play, temporarily. Try to learn how they do it, then try it yourself., Observe the person who has your role, and compare it to your performance. Try to improve by correcting little things, such as hand movements or pauses in speeches., Focus on nothing else but your lines and the character's personality. If it is an angry and rude character, say your lines with anger and violence. If it is a sweet character, speak in a soft and gentle voice. Practice until you are tone, posture and delivery perfect.  Research on the Internet about the nature of the character if they were famous. If not, figure it out yourself by learning about the entire play. If the character is brave, then learn how to look brave physically. For example, looking right into the eye while talking, firm posture, holding your chin up and so on.  Pretend that they are the audience. Ask their opinion on how they thought you performed, and also ask for advice and small tips. Add these tips to your act., Finally, on the big day, calm down, do not think of your lines, and perform with all your heart. Do not think of anything like humiliation; instead, just focus on the task to be done and treat it like any other activity that must be done well. Act as though the audience isn't there, and act as though you are at home, in front of a mirror. Remember, you are the only person who can judge yourself.	Learn your lines word for word. Watch good actors, particularly your friends, perform their part. Watch the same play you are performing, but by different people. Practice in front of the mirror. Try your lines out in front of your family. Pull it all together.
Reefing points are 1, 2 or 3 horizontal rows of cringles (reinforced grommets) and reefing lines (attached ties) on the mainsail. From the foot of the sail up, each row of reefing points shortens the sail a little more.    This system runs a special set of lines through the reefing points, so you can reef the sail by tightening just one line.    Boats with roller reefing have gears that allow you to shorten the mainsail by turning a crank that furls the sail around the boom or the mast.    Larger boats, and those used in racing, may be equipped with automated reefing systems. These are essentially push-button versions of roller reefing systems. In the most sophisticated systems, the boom or mast may have a specially constructed hollow into which the mainsail is furled.	Look for reefing points on the mainsail. Check to see if the boat is rigged for jiffy reefing. Identify roller reefing systems. Find automated reefing systems.
Use metallic golden spray paint on the styrofoam ball.   Put newspaper down so you don't stain your workstation Stick a toothpick to hold the ball while you paint it. Make the coats light so that the paint doesn't melt the styrofoam.Let it dry.  As an alternative to using paint, you can use glitter or sequins. If you want to use glitter to decorate your snitch, just spray the ball with adhesive, and sprinkle glitter over it. Brush off excess glitter and reapply until you are happy with the result. If you want to use gold sequins, stick small pins into the sequins, and then stick them into the styrofoam ball, until the ball is evenly covered with sequins., Take two gold, yellow, or white feathers, coat the ends with glue, and stick onto the ball.   Make sure the wings are perfectly opposite one another on the ball. If the stems of the feathers are strong enough, they can be stuck directly into the styrofoam, without the need for glue.	Paint the snitch. Attach glitter or sequins (optional). Attach feathers.
The rubber pad and the lino cutter tools may be found near the rubber stamping supplies but often they are found in the calligraphy or carving supplies. If you do not find them at your local craft store you may check in college book stores or there are sources online. You can also carve erasers. They are cheaper, but smaller.; , For inspiration, use Google image search and choose black and white images. If you draw your own, draw a simple line drawing (think of what you see in children's coloring books). , Pen works well. , Start with small tools, and start in the tight areas. Remove the pink and leave the ink. Do not go too deep. Go straight down into the rubber, not at an angle. Make strokes that start near ink and move away from it. Let up pressure just before arriving at another ink mark. Remove tool and start from opposite side. When making curves, turn the pad, not the tool.  Leave rubber around the edges.       Once removed, clean the edges area around the stamp with the largest tool.  Use your tools to carefully remove any unwanted or stray marks.	Purchase the materials at local craft chains. Choose an image about the size of a business card or wallet size photo. Cover the back of your image with pencil.  , Trace it onto the rubber pad. Use the pen to write directly onto the rubber.  , Carefully carve your stamp using the tools. Leave the area around the image for last: Remove the stamp with the knife-like tool. Ink your stamp and practice. Mount your stamps on children's blocks with Gorilla glue or Craft Goop.
Adjust the end pin length. Test this by playing G on the E-string - your finger should be level with your eyes.  Gently place your left knee on the back of the bass. Your feet should be in an "L" shape with your left foot parallel with the back of the bass., Keep your palm off of the neck, and let your fingers form a "claw" shape, hovering over the strings, with only flat fingertips touching the strings. (like squeezing a ball between fingertip and thumb), You can use a tuning fork or an electric tuner, or use tuning harmonics (explained elsewhere). The lowest (thickest) string is E, then A, D, and G., Classical music primarily uses the bow, while jazz, bluegrass, and other contemporary styles use pizzicato primarily. To pluck the bass properly, align your index finger pointing downward, pulling the string away with as much of your finger (from tip to middle knuckle) as possible. Proper bowing technique starts with a proper grip for your style of bow, and a relaxed body and hand. Keep the bow perpendicular to the strings, halfway between the bridge and fingerboard. The feeling should be of pulling the sound from the string rather than pressing down on the string, although significant pressure is required for clear sound., If you lay the rest of your fingers down, you naturally rest in first position. That is F# on your first finger, G on your second (middle) finger, and G# under your pinky. Work with these intervals until you get them in tune.,, Half position begins a half step lower in tone than First position on all strings.,	Start by making sure your bass is the correct height for you.  With the bass standing upright, rest the back-right edge of the bass on your left inner hip or pelvis area.  Place your left thumb on the back of the neck, a few inches from the scroll, Keep your left elbow up, parallel to the floor.  Make sure the strings are in tune.  The strings can be sounded in two main ways: Using a bow (arco) or plucked (pizzicato).  Find an F# on the lowest string by hearing a Major 2nd interval from the open string (meaning 2 half steps).  Move to the other strings in the same position, and get those notes in tune as well.On the A string, index:B middle:C pinky:C#On D string, index:E middle:F pinky:F#On the G string, index:A middle: B-flat pinky:B,  By this time, you can work on 1/2 position (F, F#, G on the E string) and shifting between these first two positions.  Work your way up the fingerboard, learning all the finger positions and their corresponding notes.
Heat up a hot glue gun and draw a line of hot glue onto the bottom of a baby onesie that fits your child. Immediately begin attaching feathers to this line of glue, adhering the feathers at their base so that the tops of the feathers face downward.   Draw the line of glue roughly 2 inches (5 cm) from the bottom of the onesie. Attach the feathers so that they are side-by-side, if not overlapping. The feathers should fan out so that some point straight down and others point down and slanted to either side. Make sure that the onesie you use is one that you do not plan to use for other purposes in the future. Once the feathers are glued on, they will stay on for good. The onesie can be in any color, but if you choose a yellow onesie, any gaps left in between the feathers will be less noticeable.; , Attach more feathers to the front of the onesie in the same manner used to attach the bottom feathers. Only draw one to three lines of glue at a time to prevent it from cooling off as you attach the feathers.   Make sure that the feathers mostly point downward by do so at varying angles. If the feathers all lie in the same exact direction, the final result will look too flat.  Take a step back and look over the front of your onesie. If any areas look too flat or if any sections appear empty, fix it by gluing more feathers into the space.   For an area that looks flat, glue extra feathers into the section beneath the current row of feathers. Make this secondary row of feathers point upward instead of down so that the patch ends up looking fluffier.  Turn the onesie over so that the back faces you. Glue feathers onto the back of the onesie using the same method you used for the front.   Start with a single line of glue at the bottom of the onesie, position roughly 2 inches (5 cm) from the bottom hem. Gradually work your way up, gluing feathers to the rest of the onesie back one small section at a time. Fill in any empty spaces or flat areas with more feathers.  Standard craft feathers are too long for use with the sleeves. Before you cover the sleeves, you need to snip the rest of your feathers in half using sharp scissors.   Note that any excess half feathers that remain after you coat the sleeves can be used to fill in additional gaps or flat areas of the costume.  As with the body of the onesie, you should work from the bottom up. Start at the edge of the sleeve and work your way to the shoulder.   Glue feathers onto the front and back of each sleeve. Work in small sections. Fill in any gaps or flat areas with additional half-feathers as needed.  Use sharp scissors to cut a foam drink cozy in half lengthwise or vertically. Even the bottom of the cozy should be cut in half.   You will be left with two identical halves, each with a half-circle bottom.  Use hot glue to attach the half-circle bottom of the cozy to the front of a snug baby cap. Trim the front of the orange cozy half so that it resembles a half-moon beak shape.  Apply more yellow half-feathers to the hat, working from the bottom up. Attach two large craft eyes on either side of the orange foam beak.   Work around the entire crown of the cap, filling any empty spaces in with additional feathers as needed.  The individual pieces of your costume are now complete, so all you need to do is put the whole thing together. Slip on some yellow leggings before putting the feathered onesie on your baby. Cover the feet with orange socks and place the feathered-and-beaked cap on your baby's head, with the beak at the front.	Glue a row of yellow feathers onto the bottom of the onesie. Work in sections until you reach the sleeves. Fill in any gaps. Repeat with the back. Cut the remaining feathers in half. Cover each sleeve with feathers. Cut an orange drink cozy in half. Glue the cozy to a soft baby cap before trimming it. Decorate the cap with feathers and eyes. Assemble the costume.
Pear cultivars, including the “Bradford” pear tree, are classified as an invasive species in much of the eastern and mid-western United States as well as a few isolated areas in California and Utah.Always ask your local Extension office if a callery pear can be planted in your area before purchasing it.; , However, they will also grow just fine in clay and sandy soil.They will grow equally well in highly acidic, neutral and highly alkaline soil, so a soil pH test is unnecessary., Avoid planting sites near structures, driveways or parking areas and sidewalks where a fallen branch could do damage.   The canopies on these trees will eventually reach a width of 20 to 25 feet. So, the tree should be planted at least 15 feet away to limit the possibility of damage if a branch breaks and falls.  During this time, the tops of the trees will be dormant, allowing them to devote all their energy to growing new roots.   Planting them in autumn also gives them time to increase their root system, resulting in a healthier, more resilient tree that will be ready to grow vigorously in the spring.However, you can plant callery pears in containers or with wrapped, B&B roots any time from spring through fall. B&B are balled-and-burlapped roots.  Keep them in a shady area where they are protected from strong, drying wind.   The root system will be damaged if they are allowed to dry out.  If the soil is clay, use a hand trowel or hand rake to scratch up the sides of the hole.   When a shovel is pushed into clay soil, it creates a smooth surface or “glaze” that is difficult for tree roots and water to penetrate.  You can do this by laying the container on its side and sliding the tree out. You can also grasp the tree at the base of the trunk to pull it out.  Then, rinse them off or wipe the disinfectant off with a clean rag. Let them dry before using them.   Do not use them to cut the root while they are wet with disinfectant as the disinfectant will harm the tree.  These are called circling roots. They will eventually thicken and strangle the tree so its best to remove them.Cut the circling roots at the base of the root where it grows from the tree.  If the tree was root bound with a tight, full root mass in the container, use the knife to make three to four, 1- to 2-inch deep slices from the top to the bottom of the root mass.   Space the slices evenly around the root mass. Then, gently work some of the longer roots growing out of the root mass away from the rest of the roots. Slicing and loosening the roots will help the callery pear grow new roots into the soil instead of keeping them within the thick root mass.  If the “burlap” is actually plastic wrapping, untie it at the top and carefully slide it out from under the tree.   If it is natural burlap, untie it, pull it down off the top of the rootball and leave it in the bottom of the hole. It will decompose on its own. Pulling it out from under the tree may damage the roots.  As well, if there is a wire basket on the roots, which is not uncommon for B&B trees, use wire cutters to cut the basket and remove it.   There should be no wires of any sort left around the roots or the trunk.  Use a shovel to do this., Do not crush or bend the roots. Crushed and bent roots at planting time will likely result in a dead tree.  You should gently working it under and between the roots of bare-root trees. Then, fill the hole halfway.  Finish filling the hole and create a 3-inch high ring of soil around the outer edge of the rootball, not the outer edge of the hole.   This will encourage the water to soak in right above the rootball where the tree needs it rather than the loose soil in the planting hole beyond the rootball.  Pour it over the rootball and over the loose soil beyond the rootball to finish settling the soil.  This will help it retain moisture.   Be sure to keep the mulch 3 inches away from the trunk. Mulch pushed right up against a tree trunk can damage the bark and cause cankers, which will kill the tree.  The best way to determine if the rootball is becoming dry is to poke your finger into it at several different spots.   If it is still wet, check it again in a couple of days. The rootball should be kept slightly moist at all times for the first three months after planting., This way, water can be directed right over the roots but not directly on the tree trunk.   During the following year, while the tree is still become established, allow the top 1 to 2 inches of soil to dry, then give it 6 to 9 gallons or 2 to 3 inches of water. Typically, running a hose for 5 minutes will deliver 10 gallons of water.This sort of deep watering will encourage the tree to grow its roots deeper into the soil, making it more drought tolerant.  These are all signs the tree is not getting enough water.If it is getting too much water, its leaves will turn pale green or yellow or may stay green but become brittle and any new branches will wilt.	Check if pear cultivars are considered invasive in your area or state. Plant Bradford  pears in loamy soil, if possible. Find a site with at least six hours of direct sunlight. For the best results, plant all callery pears, including those sold bare-root without any soil on the root system, in autumn after a hard frost. Water the callery pear trees every day until they can be planted. Dig the hole with a dirt shovel to a depth equal to the height of the callery pear tree’s root mass and twice the width. Remove container-grown callery pears from their containers. Disinfect a pair of sharp hand pruners by soaking them in household disinfectant for 5 minutes. Use the hand pruners to cut any roots that are growing around the outside of the root mass. Use a clean, sharp kitchen knife to cut the root mass. Set balled-and-burlapped (B&B) callery pears in the hole with the root wrapping on the root mass. Cut any circling roots on the B&B callery pear root mass. Break up any hard clumps of dirt and remove any stones from the backfill soil. Use your fingers to spread the roots and hold them over the center of the hole by the base of the trunk. Push the soil into the hole around the roots. Pour 1 to 2 gallons of water evenly over the soil to settle it around the roots. Water the tree with another 2 to 3 gallons of water. Spread a 2- to 3- inch depth of organic mulch over the soil. Water the tree when the soil in the rootball begins to dry. Use a watering can or a garden hose to water the tree. Water the tree if its leaves are wilting, curling, turning brown and yellow or dropping off.
; ,, Leave for about 3 to 4 weeks to infuse, remembering to shake the potpourri every few days.  If the scent is strong enough to your liking, then it is ready to use.

When working with bleach, it's vital to wear protective gear for your safety. Put on thick gloves and goggles before mixing your solution. Also, be sure to mix bleach in a well ventilated area such as outdoors or in a garage., To soak a conch, mix a solution using half bleach and half water. The precise amounts you need of each depends on how many conches you're soaking. You need enough bleach and water to fully submerge your conches., Once you've mixed the bleach and water, add your conches to the solution. In about 24 hours, you can remove them from the solution. Some of the dirt will have come off, and any stuck on barnacles will be easier to remove.Make sure to wear gloves when putting your conches in the solution, as well as when you remove them.  A dental tool, flathead screw driver, or strong pick is used to pick off barnacles. Wedge the pick or tool under the barnacle and gently pry it off. This should be fairly easy, as the bleach should have loosened the barnacles.If barnacles are being stubborn, chisel them off using a hammer and screwdriver. Angle the screwdriver under the barnacle and gently tap on the end with the hammer. This should dislodge the barnacle.  After removing barnacles, take a scrub brush and wipe down your conches. Use light, scrubbing motions to remove any remaining dirt and debris form the shell.If some dirt or stains are not coming off, use your thumbnail to gently scratch them out of the shell.  It's important that your conch shells air dry. Set them in a dry place where they will not be disturbed, such as a cupboard or cabinet. Do not attempt to polish your shells until they are completely dry to the touch.It can sometimes take conch shells awhile to completely dry, especially if you live in a cooler region. It is not unusual for shells to take a couple of days to dry completely.  Once your shells are dry, they may look a little dull from the cleaning process. To brighten them up, dab some mineral oil onto a cotton pad or cotton ball. Rub the cotton on the shell and cover it completely with oil. If the shells is not as shiny as you want after one layer, add another.If you do multiple coats, let the shell dry for 12 hours between each coat.  Make sure the shells you take from the beach do not house aquatic life. Tap the shell gently after picking it up to make sure it is empty. If you hear any scuttling, or see an animal in the shell, put it back where you found it., To dry your shells faster, you can place them out in the sun. However, do not leave them in the sun for more than a few hours. If shells are left in the sun for too long, they will start to lose color., Be extra cautious when removing barnacles. Only use the chiseling method if it's absolutely necessary. You do not want to crack or damage your shell while removing barnacles.	Put on protective gear. Prepare your bleach solution. Soak your shells for 24 hours. Pick off any barnacles. Scrub down your shell. Let the shells air dry. Cover your shell in oil. Examine your shells before taking them from the beach. Do not leave shells out in the sun too long. Be careful not to crack the shell when removing barnacles.
Tear off a foot long section. Then, fold it length-wise so that the sticky side is completely covered., With scissors or a knife, cut two eye-slits in your duct tape mask. They should be small enough so that a lot of light can't get in, but big enough so you can still see.  Punch holes on each end and thread a piece of string or a shoelace through them. This will hold your sunglasses in place.  Notice how little sunlight gets in your eyes. These sunglasses work similar to the way the blinds on your windows at home do.	Get a roll of duct tape. Make the eye-slits. Create the fasteners. Test your sunglasses.
This works best if you spray the key, or place a straw against the lock and spray through the straw. You may use any of the following:Commercial deicer Rubbing alcohol PTFE powder lubricant (best for prevention) Warning: avoid WD40, grease lubricant, and silicone lubricant, which can gum up the lock. Graphite is safe in small quantities. Do not combine multiple lubricants., Place a cardboard toilet paper roll or another cylindrical object over the lock to direct the air. Heat the lock by blowing into the roll with your breath or a blow dryer.This may take some time.  Only try this if the key is 100% metal and does not contain an electronic chip. Hold the key with thick gloves or tongs, and heat it above a match or lighter. Insert the key into the lock and wait for the ice to thaw.	Spray lubricant on the key or lock. Blow warm air into the lock. Heat the key.
For some reason, the 2-in-1 combo shampoos seem to work the best. Choose a fragrance that goes well with mint.         You can try plain shampoo as well, but make sure that it is thick.  You can use white toothpaste or gel toothpaste, it does not matter. You will need to use the same amount of toothpaste as you did shampoo.  Keep stirring until the color is consistent and no streaks remain. As you stir, the shampoo and toothpaste will come together and form a putty-like slime.  If the slime is too thick for you, you can add in some more shampoo. If it is too thin, try some more toothpaste. Make your addition, then stir it in well.  This slime is not quite as gooey as the store-bought kind, but it is fun to poke and prod. When you are done playing with it, scoop it into an airtight container.	Squeeze some 2-in-1 shampoo into a mixing bowl. Add in some toothpaste. Stir the two together with a spoon. Adjust the consistency, if needed. Play with the slime.
Battery terminals often corrode, which can lead to issues with the electrical system of your vehicle. Remove the cables on the battery and use a wire brush to scrub the terminals until they are clean, exposed metal.Soaking the ends of the battery cables in an anti-corrosion chemical like CLR can also help ensure a strong electrical connection.  If the battery has corrosion caused by leaking battery acid, you can neutralize it as you clean by using a combination of baking soda and water. Pour a bit of baking soda into a bucket of water and mix it thoroughly. Dip your brush in the mixture and use that to scrub the battery terminals and any other areas acid may have leaked.Baking soda makes for an effective cleaning solution as well as a neutralizer for the battery acid.  Plastic parts of your engine, such as engine covers and reservoir caps may be difficult to scrub clean. Start by using a stiff toothed, plastic bristled brush along with car wash soap or degreaser. Once the hard to remove grime has been removed, use a sponge with car wash soap to get the last of the grime off before rinsing the pieces with water.You may choose to remove the components to clean them out of the engine bay, but it is not required. Avoid using steel toothed brushes on plastic as it may cause scratches.  Brake cleaner breaks up grime and evaporates quickly. Insert the straw into the nozzle of the brake cleaner and direct it at hard to clean spots or areas where the grime is particularly thick. Use a hard toothed brush to scrub the grime away, then spray it again with brake cleaner to rinse it.Be careful using brake cleaner in enclosed areas as the fumes can be hazardous. Brake cleaner is extremely flammable, so don’t use it while smoking or near flames.	Use a wire brush on battery terminals. Apply baking soda and water to battery acid. Use a stiff bristled brush and a sponge on plastic parts. Use brake cleaner to spot clean grime deposits.
; , You can also look for shirts at a local thrift store or buy them on clearance from a store like Walmart or Target.  Smooth it so that it doesn't have any wrinkles on either side. Make sure the bottom edges match up.  You can align it so that you can use the bottom hem to save time when you sew.  Using a plastic ruler, mark a line on the top and bottom of your shirt material to show the center of the dress pattern. Use this opportunity to change the pattern slightly if you choose.   If you want the dress to fit your baby as she grows larger, you can add an inch or 2 (2.5 to 5 cm) to the pattern on the right side. Fabric pen is washable.       Use this opportunity to change the silhouette if you would like. Dresses can be changed to be a-line or include a wider skirt.       Mark the points on the sides of the dress material where the arm holes will go, if it does not have a large indentation. This will help you to measure your bias tape later on.  Take into account any adjusted pattern lines.  Check that it is folded across the center line on the top and bottom. ,	Find a dress that currently fits your baby. Save some adult jersey knit shirts that no longer fit. Lay out your shirt on a craft table. Lay your child's dress on the top of the shirt. Trace the right side of the dress with your fabric pen. Cut out the right side of the pattern along with your fabric scissors. Fold the right side of the dress vertically. Trace the left side of the pattern according to the folded edge, so that your pattern will be symmetrical.  , Cut out the left portion of the pattern with your fabric scissors.
There are two ways to sew a hem: by hand or with a sewing machine. While the latter is obviously faster, the former allows you to sew a hem without many tools. If you can, set up your sewing machine for your hem; use a straight stitch for a double-fold hem.; , Lay out your clothing on a countertop pattern-side down, with the hem/edge in front of you. Fold the fabric edge up ⅝-inch, and use an iron to flatten it out. Then, starting from the edge, create a second fold over the first ⅝-inch wide, so that the raw edge of the first fold is hidden under the second fold.          ⅝-inch is the standard seam allowance, but you can use whatever measurement you want for your hem.  Use multiple straight pins to secure this fold. Insert the pins so that the blunt end (often with a pearl) sticks out from the hem, while the needle-end of the pin is inserted towards the fabric. This will make them much easier to remove as you sew (if you’re using a sewing machine).  Either with your sewing machine or by hand, use a matching thread to your fabric and sew a straight stitch along the top edge of the fold. Work all the way around until you’ve sewn the whole hem, and then tie off and cut your thread.  You’re almost done! To finish off your hem, you need to iron it so it lays down flat. If your fabric can handle it, use a bit of steam to help with the ironing process. When you’re done ironing, turn your fabric right-side-out, and enjoy your newly completed hem.	Decide how you will sew your hem. Fold your hem. Pin the hem in place. Sew your hem. Iron the hem.

If you’ve followed proper planting and maintaining methods and your daisies still aren’t thriving, try testing the soil. Daisies prefer slightly acidic soil. Soil test kits should reflect a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0.Add limestone if your soil is too acidic. Add sulfur or peat moss if the soil is too alkaline.  Daisies can be affected by the following pests: aphids, mites, leafminers, nematodes, thrips and whiteflies. Most often, you will have to remove the affected leaves, isolate infested plants from healthy ones, apply a narrow-range oil or insecticidal soap, or use a water spray.Visit a garden center or shop online to find available products for addressing specific pest problems.  You can do this if the daisies show signs of disease. Daisies stricken with fungal or bacterial diseases are likely too moist and/or crowded. Signs of disease problems include leaf spotting, yellowing or death, stunted shoots, and wilting.Remove any spent or damaged blooms and leaves, then clear plant debris from the area to keep the plant bases dry.  Mold may develop on the soil of indoor plants. If you see white mold on the soil's surface, scrape it off using gloves and move the plant to a well-ventilated area to let it dry out.If the mold returns, replant the daisies in a clean container with fresh, sterile indoor potting soil.	Check the pH level of the soil. Treat daisies for pests as needed. Secure a cleaner, drier environment. Deal with mold.
This will essentially be your hotbed. While hotbeds were traditionally made with horse manure, any compostable materials will do. A pile of leaves and grass clippings will do the trick; you might be able to find a local landscaping company that will happily "donate" this material. Try to keep the top of the pile level. You'll also want to avoid making the pile so wide that you can't reach into the middle of it if you need to.       ; , This serves two purposes: evening the surface, and holding in the heat.  You'll want the thermometer to read around 105℉ (40℃). Use a compost thermometer if you can. , This will help retain heat.	Create a large, rectangular compost pile. Add straw to the top of the pile. Measure the temperature of the hotbed. Put the seedling flats on the hotbed.         , Cover the whole hotbed with a plastic sheet.
You need a clean environment to prevent dust and dirt from mixing with the tinting. Doing everything indoor is not a bad idea. But if you want to work outside, you should choose a clean and dry place.       ; , Remove any stickers inside of your car screen and clean off all the adhesives or any sticky things that can create problems with the film sticking on the windows. Remove all the obstructions inside the car that can restrict your process and get in your way. Finally, vacuum the interior to get rid of dust.  Lower the window slightly so that you can get the top as well. Mix a few drops of dish soap with warm water and spray or wipe it on the window, then use the blade to scrape away all the dirt and grime. Make sure you clean both sides of the window well, removing everything.          Never use Windex, or cleaner with ammonia in it. It will tint your windows purple when you're done. Make sure you get all the edges and seals, and role the window up to get the bottom. You're going to need almost a gallon of soapy water throughout this process. Prepare the water ahead of time to make working easier. A spray bottle is highly recommended.  Wipe away the soapy water on both sides and dry off the edges as well. If you're using a spray bottle, refill it with more soapy water. A squeegee will help you get the window completely dry.          You will need a plenty of soapy water to ensure that the tint doesn't stick or rip. Make sure you get underneath the seals in the interior of the car. Use your finger to get under the seal and remove dirt and dust.  You'll need to move the window up and down as you work. For now, leave it up.  Like a sticker, the tint has a layer that can be peeled off right before adhering it to the window. Make sure, as you work with the tint, that this side is facing you.  The water will help the tinting temporarily adhere, but still make it slippery enough to slide around and put into place.  Unroll your tinting so that it covers the entire window, with at least 2-3" of extra tinting over the edges. The liner (the part that will later adhere to the window), should be facing you.          Make sure you do not remove the liner -- you're just sizing and pressing the tinting right now, now adhering it.  You should have a few inches of extra tint in every direction, but you don't want to be maneuvering the entire roll of film while working. Use a precision knife or blade to cut a usable square of tinting film from the larger role.  Once the tint is cut into a square, it should stick to the water on the outside of the window. You should then spray the tint itself so that the entire thing is covered in a thin layer of soapy water.  Simply use the edges of the window to trace your knife across the tinting film. You want a perfectly shaped line to ensure the tint fits. When done, two of the edges should fit perfectly, and the rest should still be square.          As you cut, use the squeegee or your free hand to make sure the film is flush with the window. When done, cut the excess film away and discard.  You want to shift the film towards the edge you just cut. This ensures that you have enough tint to cover every edge of the window, including the part covered by the seal.  Once you slice the right edge off, pull the tint partially back to the center, so that there is roughly 1/2" of extra tinting film on either side of the window.  This is the tint that will eventually go into the door, allowing you a better light seal. Slide it down and then use the squeegee to flatten it again. You'll be doing the same thing you just did with the right and left side on the top and bottom edges.  Once the window is lowered, you can use this top edge of the window as your guide. Use the precision knife to cut right to the top of the window. When done, pull the tint back towards the center. You should have roughly 1/2" of extra film on every side of the window.  When cutting away, the corners may have bits and pieces of extra film in the corners. Use your knife to clean it all up.  You may need to reapply water to make it stick. If so, remove the cut tint, spray some more soapy water, and reapply the film to the window.  Get out all the air and water by working from the top downward. Smooth the entire film out on the outside of the window. As you push to the bottom, you'll see zig-zagging from the "fingers" of air still stuck in the film. This is a good sign. Keep pushing downward, then run the heat gun along the bottom of the window to make sure it is all dried out.          You can leave the tint stuck to the outside of the window now. You'll have to prep the inside window a bit more, so this is a good place to ensure that the tint stays dust free.  You're going to go through a lot of soapy water in this process. You can use a hard edge to get in between the seal and the window for a better clean. When done, spray the whole window with soapy water.  Window tint works just like a sticker. There is a removable layer that adheres to the tint and keeps the adhesive solid. You should, however, only peel off only the top half for now-- it makes it easier to work with.          Just gently work the tint between two fingers like you were snapping to get the adhesive layer off.  You are now ready to adhere the tint to the window.  The water makes the tint easy to slide around, so you can get the edge of the window perfectly lined up with the top edge of the tint. Your window should still be slightly down.  Once the top edge is on the window, sneak the two sides into the seals to the right and left, using your fingers to get them roughly flush. With one hand, pull back the seal around the window, then use the other hand to push the film under the seal and onto the window.          Remember to keep everything doused in soapy water to make it easier to move around.  Using your squeegee or hard-edge, slowly work the water out by pushing the water to the sides. Push the water out the top and sides, but don't push towards the bottom, where you have the rest of you liner waiting to be adhered.          You should keep a hand on the tint at all times to keep it from moving as you squeegee the water out.  Don't skimp on the soapy water -- it is essential to prevent the tint from sticking.  Make sure both the window and the tint are wet.  Spray off the tint with soapy water again. This is tricky, but should be easy with a hard edge. Pull back the seal with your fingers, then use the hard edge to push the film down and onto the window.  Work downward and outward whenever possible, spraying the tint with more soapy water to make sure you don't rip the liner. Keep squeegeeing the water out of the tinting so that it is smooth, as if it was just a part of the window.	Find a clean, dry work space. Remove any stickers or adhesives from the windows. Clean up the windows using soapy water and a 1" razor blade. Take a clean rag and dry the window. Roll the window back up before beginning, but leave your car on. Determine which side of the tint is adhesive. Spray the outside of the window with soapy water. Place the tinting over the outside of the window so that it covers the entire window. Cut away a manageable slab of tinting. Spray the front of the film with water. Take your knife and cut along the bottom and left edges of the window. Pull the film 1" towards the left edge. Cut the right edge, then slide the tint halfway back towards the center. Pull the film down roughly one inch, so the bottom edge is lower than the window. Lower the window a half inch, then use the top of the window to cut the film to shape. Clean up any of the corners that have excess film. Realign your film so that it fits the window perfectly, with some excess on every edge. Working from the top down, use a heat gun and a hard card to push the bubbles to the bottom. Prep the inside of the window with soapy water and a squeegee. Peel off the top half of the release liner from the tinting film. Spray off the now-exposed section with fresh water. Line up and adhere the top of the tint to the window. Slightly fold the tint to work it underneath the seal. Spray down the window again, then use your hard edge to push the water out the edges. Roll the window up, then spray the bottom half of the window with soapy water. Pull of the remaining release layer, then spray the exposed tint with water. Use your fingers and hard edge to tuck the bottom of the tint into the bottom seal. Smooth out the window with your hard edge, pushing all the water and air bubbles towards the edges.
Make sure your computer is turned off first!; , (Leave a few inches of wire on the connectors so that you can use them later on for other projects). , The color code for the wires is: Red = +5V, Black = Ground (0V), White = -5V (not used), Yellow = +12V, Blue = -12V, Orange = +3.3V (not used except if you have a brown wire in your supply, Purple = +5V Standby (not used), Gray = power is on (output), and Green = Turn DC on (input).  Also drill a hole for the LED, and also cut out square piece where the LCD will go and also drill room for a potentiometer with knob.    Connect one of the red wires to the power resistor, connect all the remaining red wires to the red binding posts; Connect one of the black wires to the other end of the 10 ohm power resistor, one black wire to a resistor (330 ohm) attached to the cathode (shorter lead) of the LED and the other end of the LED (anode) connected to the gray wire,all the remaining black wires to the black binding post; Connect the +12VDC wires to the desired post( but leave one wire left alone so that you can use for variable voltage), the -12 VDC to desired post(the excess piece of wire cut and save for variable voltage section). Variable voltage binding should be left alone at this point and nothing should be soldered to it. Note some power supplies might have a brown sensing wire and or a pink wire. If you have a brown wire, solder it to the 3.3v orange wire and cut the rest out since you won't need to use them, and if you have a pink wire, solder it to the red wire. Please also notice the rubber grommets in the picture that are at the binding post. these are to be put on first then put on the nuts because this is to prevent metal nuts from making contact with the metal case so there for no shorting all the other binding posts together.    Using the components gathered, build the following circuit on a circuit board, but solder wires to the potentiometer to make it out of circuit. By that i mean only the wires are to be attached to the pc board rather then the actual pot being soldered. This is because we are attaching the potentiometer to the case so that we can use it as a knob to turn it to adjust the voltage we want. Note that the way you will power up the circuit is using those +12VDC wires and -12 VDC wires.  Use hot glue to paste it. , This will be your regulated voltage coming out.   Attach LCD voltmeter to case and then hook up power to the LCD using +12VDC supply from the bindings and hook up to ground and then hook up the +input to the regulated post and the - output to the ground post.  This regulator can regulate voltages from 1.2VDC to 24VDC.  And please read tips so that you can follow things more clearly.	Unplug the power cord from the back of the computer. Cut off the connectors. Open up the power supply unit by removing the screws connecting the top and the bottom of the PSU case.  , Bundle wires of the same colors together. Start by drilling holes using a dremel tool or drill to the size of the banana jack post you are going to use. Connect all the pieces together. Build the voltage regulator circuit. Attach build circuit board with some kind of liquid adhesive to the case so that it sticks to the side somewhere. Attach potentiometer to drilled hole in case and paste it with the hot glue.  , Attach V regulated wire out of the PC board onto the last empty post on your supply case and solder it onto it. Using this LCD will tell you what your regulated voltage out is from that post. Do a check following the checklist in the tips section to make sure everything is connected correctly and everything is cleaned correctly. Once finished power up the power supply using switch in the back of the supply and LED should turn on along with fan and there should be no problems.
Some online retailers may retain older stocks of toys or will know how to source them for you. Check out stores that specialize in online toy sales, and more specifically, that have a focus on discontinued toy lines, to see what they have on offer. It is also a good idea to check out stores that carry used toys in good condition.   You can use a site such as Flipkart or Andromeda.; , There are quite a few of these around the world, and there is a big possibility that someone, somewhere is selling that toy you're after. The trick is to not look just in your own backyard, but to search worldwide. Some auction sites are international, while some are country-specific. This means that while you'll likely have no problems finding things on the international sites, be sure to also check sites available in the countries where the item was originally manufactured, especially if this is not China.   Some sellers specialize in selling discontinued or hard-to-find toys through sites such as eBay and Etsy.  Such sites may have forums, trading places and other ways to connect with fellow fans or collectors of the toy you're after. Be prepared to either pay a fair price, plus shipping, or to give something of equal value in exchange.  Sites that allow giveaways, such as Freecycle, are great places to check for old toys. Join up, then browse through the lists of freebies available in your area. If nothing is showing up that is relevant, place a "Wanted" request and wait. Someone may just have the toy you're after.  These are the stores in out of way places, such as the countryside or a suburb with mostly elderly residents. They may still carry stocks long exhausted in the larger urban areas. Do a phone around of such stores, including country or rural toy stores to see whether they have old stock not yet sold. You can even extend this search to stores in other countries, where the toy may not have sold out as quickly or have been as popular as your own country.  The item will likely be used but in many cases, you can often find old toys in good condition. In lucky cases, the item might even still be in its box, unused. However, this is a very "hit and miss" method, so you'll need to have a good eye for sifting through junk boxes and prepare to be disappointed a lot of the time.  If the stores stock toys, there is a chance that your toy might be there, especially if it's a collectible. To save time, it can be easier to call the store first. If it turns out that they stock the items, head on down to check out their supplies; if not, keeping phoning around.  If they deal in toys, it is possible that they might have your toy if it was discontinued in recent years.  They might have online catalogs or it might be easier to call and ask if they have the toy coming up for auction and whether they know of a collector who might be willing to sell one.  These are fun, so you can plan to go to one just to enjoy it. It might be a good opportunity to find that old toy. In many cases, there is a premium placed on the condition of the toy, including coming with its original box or packaging, so if that's what you're after, toy auctions are a great choice.  Sometimes old toys get caught up in storage places or become part of liquidated assets of failed businesses. This is a long shot, as it requires turning up to all sorts of auctions that don't identify the stock necessarily, but if you like rummaging and think auctions are fun, you just never know what might turn up. If toys are mentioned, it might be worth going; even if all you get is something cool to trade with.	Visit online stores that sell toys. Look on major auction or trading sites. Check out trade or swap sites run by collectors or fans. Check out freebie sites. Check toy stores that are more out of the way or "stuck in time". Check thrift, charity or opportunity stores. Check secondhand or antique stores. Check out wholesalers that sell discontinued stock. Check out which auction houses deal with toys. Visit toy auctions. Check out storage auctions or liquidation auctions.
Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are the easiest to cultivate.  They can be cultivated anywhere, but choosing an object such as a plastic cup or a plate will prevent accidents., The more seeds you want to cultivate, the more cotton that you will need. Do not soak the cotton, or the seeds will not grow. Place the cotton where you have decided to grow the plants., Burying or placing the seeds too closely next to each other will cause the sprouts to grow with difficulties, and may kill the struggling plant., In warm temperatures, do this every two days, and in cold temperatures, two times a week. After about three days, the sprouts will germinate., When the sprouts reaches about 20 centimeter (7.9 in), bury the cotton, along with the sprouts, in the soil.	Choose the variety and quantity of beans you want to grow. Decide where you will grow the bean seeds. Get a piece of clean cotton and moisten it. Distribute the seeds above the cotton. Water the beans when the cotton is starting to dry. Plant the sprouts.
By simply placing your middle finger on the third fret of the first string, you can create an abbreviated version of the chord that may be easier for you when transitioning between chords.         This abbreviated version is not an open chord. You do not strum the sixth, fifth, or fourth strings of the guitar. Only strum the third, second, and first strings.  Make the basic G major chord shape, then place your pinkie on the third fret of the second string. This adds another C to your chord and gives your strumming a slightly fuller sound.         Some guitarists find it more comfortable to switch their pinkie and ring fingers. Find the shape that is comfortable for you.  While the standard fingering of a G major chord puts your ring finger on the high E, you may find it more comfortable to put your pinkie on the high E, using your ring finger on the low E and your middle finger on the A.  If you know how to make the shape of a D chord, moving your fingers to the seventh fret with your fingers fretting the highest three strings also will produce a G chord.         With the D chord shape, your index and middle fingers are on the seventh fret. Your ring finger is on the eighth fret. Your index finger frets the G, your middle finger frets the high E, and your ring finger frets the B.  The G7 chord is a bit of a stretch for your fingers, but if you get to the point where you can make this chord shape comfortably, it will provide a bluesier tone to your music.Place your middle finger on the second fret of the A string and your ring finger on the third fret of the low E. You'll notice this is a similar shape to the standard G form, just with different fingers. Now stretch back your index finger to the first fret of the high E. Remember to keep your hand curled so you don't mute any of the strings. Strum all six strings openly to play this chord.	Try the abbreviated version of the G major chord. Play the "rock" G for a richer, deeper sound. Use your pinkie on the high E string. Use a D chord shape at the seventh fret. Vary it up with a G7 chord.
Seriously, you can plant them! While the increased interest in popcorn shoots have lead to more specialized popcorn seeds that are meant for shoot production, you standard popcorn seeds will grow shoots too! In fact, the ones meant for movie night will end up tasting much like the popcorn snack you’re used to, with an added dose of sweetness., More and more interest in popcorn shoots (as opposed to traditional popcorn) has led some seed purveyors to package and sell popcorn seeds specifically for growing shoots. Admittedly, these are preferable to the seeds sold for use as actual popcorn, as they will be free of things like salt, preservatives, and flavoring.These seeds even come in separate colors, though you’re more likely to find the white and yellow varieties, as opposed to the oft-sought red variety. Do a quick online search for popcorn shoot seeds or visit your local health food store to see if they carry them. Note that many seed website sell sprouting kits. These will come with everything you need, including a tray and a container to sprout the seeds prior to planting.  If you get a package of seeds meant to be grown, the package will likely contain information about how much to use, such as one bag for a specifically sized tray. To help establish the correct amount, spread dry seed into the bottom of the empty tray you’ll use to grow the shoots. They should be evenly but densely spread, just barely covering the bottom surface of the tray.As a general guideline, use 1/4-1/3 cup for a 5x5in (13x13cm) tray. Use 1-1 1/2 cup for an 10x10in (25x25cm) tray, and 2-3 cups for a tray that’s 10x20in (25x50cm). If you’re growing your seeds in a hot, humid climate, you may need to use a bit less seed. While plenty of seeds usually works wonderfully, mold may be more likely to grow between closely-spaced shoots in more tropical climates.  Place the seeds you’ll be planting in a bowl or jar. Add twice or three times the volume of seeds in water. The water should be neither cold nor hot. Sixty to seventy degrees Fahrenheit is ideal (16-21 degrees Celsius). After mixing the seeds gently to ensure water has made contact with each seed, allow them to sit for eight to twelve hours.As they soak, keep the seeds out of direct sunlight. They don’t need to be in complete darkness, but put them somewhere indoors where they won’t be disturbed and where the temperature is constant.  After carefully draining the water from the soaked seeds, rinse them in cool (60-70°F/16-21°C) water and drain thoroughly. Then simply place the seeds in your sprouter and set the sprouter somewhere indoors and out of direct sunlight.Light doesn’t matter much to a plant before it has leaves. Temperature does though; keep your sprouter somewhere close to 70°F (21°C). There are all sorts of manual sprouters, including both jars and bags. Visit a local gardening store or check out your options online., Your seeds are about ready to burst and begin to sprout. You can help them do so by rinsing several times over the next few days. In fact, rinse and drain your seeds every eight to twelve hours with cool water. You’ll likely do about three total rinses and drains before the seeds sprout.Once most of the seeds start showing their roots, they’re ready to plant. Try to catch them before roots are more than a ¼ of an inch (~½ a cm) long.  In growing vernacular, “medium” refers to the material in which you’ll grow your shoots. Soil is a classic example, and may the easiest to work with for most first time growers. The amount of medium you’ll need depends on the type you choose. Keep in mind that the medium’s job is to hold your sprouts in place and provide them with water.Other medium options for plants like popcorn shoots include "baby blankets" and Vermiculite. Baby blankets are actually a pad-like material that can be cut to the shape of the wells in your planting tray. While Vermiculite in particular is great at retaining moisture, both of these options are more expensive than soil, require more particular watering methods, and require the use of fertilizer.  If you use soil, the amount you use isn’t as important as keeping it wet. The more you use, the more water the soil will hold, and the less often you need to water the plants. However, more soil also means you have to do more careful mixing when you do add water. Essentially, you want all of the soil to be wet, but without water puddling on the surface of the soil.Use your fingers to disperse water throughout the soil when you water the plants. Mix earthworm castings, which can be found online or at gardening stores, into your soil for added nutrients. Wet the castings before mixing them into your soil, and keep your medium beneath 20% earthworms castings.  Try to spread the seeds as evenly as possible. Some shoot-growers contend that you don’t want seeds to be touching, but it’s probably okay if they touch and overlap a little bit.If, during your first grow, you have issues with mold or fungus growing between your shoots, use less seeds the next time around. This is more likely in hot, humid climates, where you’ll want to disperse seeds more thinly.  Use a cover tray, which will be lightweight but impermeable to light, to cover the seeded tray and protect your growing plants from light and moisture. It’s worth using a cover tray that is designed to be compatible with your planting tray; you can purchase them together from gardening stores or online.Note that cover trays have small holes or slits to allow minimal air circulation. This can help prevent mold or fungus. Keep the tray somewhere indoors with little light and a constant temperature. While 70°F (21°C) is ideal, a slightly warmer or cooler temperature is fine. Consistency is more important.  Essentially, keep the medium moist, as this will facilitate your plants’ ability to set their roots and grow. This will likely require small amounts of watering once or twice per day. Use a gentle sprayer, such as a spray bottle or a hose handle set very low, and make sure to spray each sprouting plant each time you water.Once you’re sure the roots have set, focus on keeping the medium moist. This no longer requires spraying every plant. In fact, spray water in from the sides to avoid damaging the tender shoots as they grow taller.  If you want your popcorn shoots to be green, they will need to spend a while in the sun. After three or four days (or when the plants are pushing the covering tray up), move the planting try to a location that receives direct sunlight. Keep in mind that shoots that are grown fully in the dark may be more tender and have a more delicate flavor.Note that you will likely need to water more frequently when the plants are in the sun. Keep the medium moist to help them grow. If you do not green your shoots, they will stay a pale yellow color once harvested.  Once you’re ready to harvest, take care not to get the shoots themselves wet for a few hours, as they will store better if the shoots are dry. If you need to water, do so by pouring water directly into the tray. Once shoots are dry to the touch, simply cut the plants at just about the medium’s surface.Store shoots in a sealed container in your fridge. Ideally, use a produce storage bag, as they can extend the shoot’s shelf life. These bags can be purchased online, as well as at some specialty gardening stores.	Use popcorn kernels from your cupboard. Purchase shoot-specific popcorn seeds. Determine the amount of seeds to use. Soak the seeds overnight. Transfer the seeds to a “sprouter.” A sprouter is a container, often a glass jar with a screen lid, where you will hold the seeds until they begin to sprout and grow roots. Rinse, drain, and repeat. Choose your medium. Moisten your medium fully. Spread seeds on top of the wet medium. Cover the planted tray. Water your plants lightly. Green your shoots. Harvest your shoots when they’re 2-4in (5-10cm) tall.
You'll need a pair of teacups per set of curtains. While they don't necessarily have to match, you may prefer that they do. If they don't match, it is still a good idea to match up teacups with similar colors and general pattern. In addition to searching around your home for teacups, visit second hand or antique stores, online stores, thrift stores and even yard or garage sales.   Choose by shape and size as well. Base this decision on your curtain’s fabric and amount of material you need tied back.       Test drive different teacups. Hold each teacup next to the drapes to be sure that they're the right choice.       Choose a cup that isn’t chipped or cracked. The cup must be able to withstand being transformed from a teacup to a tieback––cracked cups may split. And chipped cups won't look as pretty. Test the handle. If it has been glued back on after a break, the cup will be unsuitable because a lot of pressure will be placed on the handle joins when attached to the hook.; , Essentially you will pulling the drapery through the actual cup and then hanging the handle on a hook. The hook may be key to not only how it holds the cup handle but how it looks. Explore porcelain or other material options for the hook, in addition to the usual metallic ones.  An errant piece of porcelain in your eye can send you to the emergency room––take precautions to prevent injury.    Perform this action on a workbench or somewhere that has good traction. You don’t want to be drilling into the cup and have it slip out from underneath you.  The size of the hole will be dependent on the girth of the curtain that will be slipped through. It's highly recommended that you place masking tape around the hole to add some strength when drilling and to help prevent cracking.  The best drill bit for this would be one suitable for drilling tiles (which are often made from similar delicate material). When drilling:  Go slowly in the marked area. Don't blaze through this––porcelain is delicate and may crack if you're too aggressive or speedy.       In some cases, it is easiest to drill smaller holes and to gradually expand these into one larger hole. Brush aside residual dust after you’ve drilled through the cup. Keep reassessing whether you need to make the hole larger. When you're happy with the size, stop drilling.  It can be handy to have a friend help here, especially if the curtain fabric is heavy or in an awkward position.   Play with where exactly you’d like the teacup to sit on the curtain. Sometimes having it located higher on the curtain than normal will increase its decorative effect.  Position the cup so that the handle is firmly linked to the handle. Readjust the teacup to ensure that the design shows clearly.   Test the strength of the handle's hold. If the grip fails, the teacup will most likely shatter if it falls on the floor so having a strong, reliable hold is important.  Repeat as many times as you need to make matching tiebacks for the room.	Select your teacups. Consider how you will match the teacup handle to the wall hook. Wear safety gloves and eyewear. Place the teacup on a flat surface in order to create a hole. Mark the area where you’d like to drill, preferably in the center of the cup. Prepare to drill. Slide the curtain material through the top portion of the cup through the hole you've made at the base of the cup. Place the tieback on the hook. Finished.
If nothing else, get a cheap USB stick and drag-and-drop your documents folder onto it. Worry about the other things later. You should do more than this, but it's most important to take the most valuable, irreplaceable information from your hard drive and put it on a second medium to guard against hard drive failure, theft or loss.Stop reading until you have done this and stop making excuses to not do it.  Some questions to ask yourself are:   Would you care if this was deleted tomorrow? For things like business accounts and documents, the answer is of course you would. This kind of thing should be your first priority.       Would you care if you had no record of this in ten years' time? Alternatively, if you're old enough to remember what happened a decade ago, What happened a decade ago that you wish you had a record of today? Your picture of your cat might not matter too much now, but you would probably think differently after your cat passed away.       How replaceable is this data? MP3s and movies you have downloaded are generally replaceable (even if it's a pain to do so), so it's not the end of the world if they get lost. Documents you have written or photos you have taken cannot easily be re-created.       How good are you at assessing the value of items? As human beings, our choice of things to back up will be fallible and probably short-sighted. Err on the side of backing up too much stuff; disk space is cheap and 23 cubic inches holds a fantastic amount of data.  This isn't to say that you must never post a picture on Facebook or say anything on Twitter; these things are fun. But remember that no online service should be considered an archive or a permanent home. Sometimes these services go down. Other times, your account there might be suspended or your data lost by accident.   Never sink time into any service that doesn't give you an easy way to get your data out again. If it doesn't allow you to download all of your stuff as either a ZIP file or with some automated tools via an API, it's probably a bad idea to use it.  Keep a current email address for any services you use in case the service goes down. If they give you any notice, it will likely be via email.  Keep local copies of everything. Don't delete your local copies after you've put something online unless you are totally, 100 percent sure that you will never want to see it again.  Watch out for signs of impending doom, either for your data or for the service as a whole. These are some of the signs that you should consider moving your data somewhere else and be doubly vigilant of having local copies of your work:   Unclear or unsustainable business model. Have fun with these services, but as with any service, don't count on it being around next year.  Losing data or extended periods of downtime should make you consider whether you want to continue being there at all. Fotopic was a fine example of this; after suffering several periods of downtime, at least one of them extended, people continued to put their photos on the site before it was shut down, with no notice, in 2011.  Reports of deletion of accounts by staff of the site. One does not even need to discuss whether they might actually have a good reason for doing so to note that this happens rather a lot to people who are not expecting it on many of today's social networking sites.  A buy-out of the service by another company that has no clear plans for its future. In particular, beware of talent acquisitions which might leave the service orphaned; the 2012 acquisition of Posterous by Twitter is a great example of this, if you're good at reading between the lines., Remember, something is better than nothing. Diminishing returns apply in backups as they do with everything else. The cheapest and simplest backup methods take care of an overwhelming majority of likely loss-of-stuff. Over-complicating your backup strategy is the biggest trap: the more complicated and expensive you insist on making it, the less likely you are to do it. Thus, while they have good intentions when they're not showing everyone else how awesome they are, people who tell you that you absolutely must go all-out with geographic redundancy probably do more harm than good to the extent that such things are necessary if you're going to have backups at all.   First level: Buy a cheap USB flash drive and shove your documents folder onto it. You already did this in the first step; do it right now if you have not. This saves your most important data from the medium most likely to fail or be stolen.  Second level: Once you have figured out what you value, buy a USB external hard drive and start copying more of your data onto that. Get into the habit of doing this at least every week. You'll have more space to play with, so you can copy the more replaceable stuff like your music collection onto it. You will also want to look into ways to download data from your online accounts (for example, backing up your blog, or using Facebook's export-to-a-big-ZIP-file feature) so you can back that up, too.       Third level: Consider some automated backup strategy. This is worth it if you care to do it, but takes more time to set up well; a poorly-designed one will result in more of your data getting lost than a simple regular manual backup if it doesn't alert you to failures of the media to which you are backing up.  Fourth level: Geographic redundancy, for stuff that you absolutely cannot lose. This takes care of, say, your house burning down. The diminishing returns are in action; this is a whole lot less likely than a hard drive dying, and of course if your house is destroyed, you're likely to be a lot more worried about finding somewhere to live and starting over again than you are about your cat photographs.  They have their place, particularly in the case of possible geographic redundancy, but never depend on them as your only backup source. Once again never delete your local copies of anything, and never use a service that does not provide you an easy way of getting your data out. Because of their widespread use for illegal purposes, "file locker" services are an especially bad place to house your data as they can disappear literally overnight.  For many people, they have supplanted or replaced conventional computers. Back up your photographs and video from your camera phone., If your stuff is interesting enough, allowing other people to make copies will result in lots of copies of your stuff being out there. Many places will accept copies of Creative Commons-licensed content; Wikimedia Commons will accept any media you have created yourself if it's vaguely educational, for example. The Internet Archive at http://www.archive.org/ will also accept collections of digital artifacts. Consider contributing to these or another similar non-profit project., If one of your backup drives fails, replace it immediately. "The universe tends towards maximum irony; don't push it."In the longer term, you'll want to move your data off various kinds of storage media as obsolescence sets in and move it onto newer ones once the newer technologies mature. Floppy disks went to the glue factory a decade ago, for example, and are quickly becoming unreadable. Writable CDs and DVDs are headed down this path; if you have data backed up on these, get them onto hard drives or solid-state media now.    The CD-RW is quickly going the way as the floppy disk, and USB will be gone one day, too. Move your stuff onto newer media as the newer media matures.  An old example of this would be your bookmarks; at the very least, keep a backup of your bookmarks file. In the Facebook era, many of your digital memories will have been made by other people; for example, photos in which you have been tagged, or tweets mentioning you. In many jurisdictions it is legal to make personal copies of other peoples' stuff provided that it is strictly for personal use., Many people who used computers in the 1980s and 1990s have already experienced the pain of finding that today's software is unable to read their documents.   Beware of software that forces you to keep using it. An example would be a photo manager that wants to import your photo library but doesn't document how your files are stored or how to get them out again. Another example (fortunately uncommon these days) would be music download services that allow you to purchase tracks but use copy protection with the explicit aim of stopping you from making copies. This especially applies to backup software; if no other program can read whatever format in which it stores your files it's useless as a long-term solution.  Beware of proprietary or weird file formats. This is the more general case of the above: Some vendors do not document their file formats precisely because they don't want you to be able to read your own stuff with anyone else's software. If your software permits it, export a copy of your work to some open file format. If your software does not allow you to do this, panic and start using an open-source alternative.  Stick to file formats that can be read by open-source software today. Open source software tends to stick around longer than closed-source software does, so even if you're using proprietary software you'll be able to open it in open source software long after the vendor of your software stops supporting it.	Make a quick backup now. Decide what you value. Beware of sinking time, and data, into online services. Start making backups. Use online backup services carefully. Don't forget your mobile devices. Consider licensing your work under a Creative Commons license, or otherwise providing an easily-downloadable copy for other people to archive. Keep an eye on your storage media. Consider how much of the digital record of you is other people's data, and consider preserving some of that. Remember that your backups are only useful insofar as you have software to read it.
Removing a washing machine's agitator is generally a simple, easy procedure with minimal risk of danger. However, accidents are possible even during the most routine acts of maintenance, so, just to be safe, disconnect your washer from its power supply before beginning. Doing this ensures that you won't accidentally be shocked or injured if the "on" button is somehow pressed accidentally.   Though injuries from washing machines are very rare for adults, they are, in fact, possible and can be quite serious. However, it's important to keep in mind that most washing machine injuries occur when the machine is full of clothes — in other words, during normal use.; , Many models of GE washer have agitators that are mounted in place with a single metal bolt (specifically, compact washers 1996 and earlier, regular 1992-1995 models, and handwash agitator models). To remove agitators on these models, this fastening bolt must first be removed. To access the bolt, remove the cap at the top of the agitator — this can usually be done either by hand or by prying with a screwdriver.   Take care if the cap is glued down. Bolt caps that are glued in place are usually fairly fragile. If bent during the removal process, they may require special glue from the manufacturer to replace.  Once you remove the cap, look down into the barrel of the agitator. You should see a metal bolt or nut holding the entire agitator housing in place. Use a ratchet (with an extender) to unscrew and remove this.   Note that, in some cases, you may see large flathead, hex head, or #20, #40, or #50 torx screws rather than a standard hex nut or bolt. In these cases, use the appropriate screwdriver or socket. When you're done, simply lift the agitator up. It should come out of the machine freely. If it doesn't, it may be stuck in place with accumulated soap or other washing chemicals. In this case, see below for more information.  For bolted agitators, re-installation is usually quite simple. Place the agitator back in the wash compartment, replace the bolt or screw, re-tighten it, and replace the agitator cap. At this point, your maintenance is complete! Plug your washing machine back in and test the function of your agitator to ensure it's working properly.	Unplug your washing machine. Remove the agitator cap. Unscrew the bolt holding the agitator down. Re-install by reversing the steps above.
Preferably drums, guitar, mic, or even a keyboard.; ,, If it is a form of extreme metal, or isn't but includes some sort of growling, screaming, squealing, gargling, screeching, or inhaling, I will offer information on extreme vocals later in the guide. Also, visit darklyrics.com to get the lyrics laid out quickly and clearly to get the rhythmical sequencing of your syllables right. Don't be like the guy in Obituary who sang the vocals and then wrote the lyrics.  You can also play by ear as the great Chuck Schuldiner did. To play by ear, simply turn your music on a stereo or computer, iHome etc, and play along. Make sure you know what tuning the group is in before following along. After enough repetition, you will learn patterns and techniques that many metal bands follow when composing songs. Soon you will be writing your own skull crushing riffs with a little blend of yourself and your influences.  They're pretty cool, really! If you hang around with a lot of like minded people who have a passion for music, you yourself will feel more motivated to continue routine practices in all kinds of music.  It is a lot of fun, and can also be a good workout if you're not in shape. Learn the different patterns and sequences that metal drummers use to fill the space in the guitar driven songs. A good way to find the beat in an unusual tempo, is by finding where the snare is played. If you can match this up right, you will have an easier time adding the other percussive elements to the drum pattern. Don't be mechanical, hit that splash often, use the ride, and buy a china!  , After a while, you're body will get used to the speed and effort and you will become much less fatigued during play.  If you're passionate, you'll practice longer sessions without thinking about it. If you have no passion, don't play music, because you'll end up sounding mechanical and boring.  If you get good enough, you could show them how to play and make them your student. Teaching others will also teach you much about proper technique and understanding the genre	Buy, borrow an instrument that you enjoy playing or would like to play. There are several ways to learn how to play this music.  , If you are a vocalist, simply sing along by ear. If you're a guitarist/bassist, search for tablature on sites like ultimateguitar.com, x-guitar.com, etc. Find other people who like metal, and get to know them. If you're a drummer, play by ear. Take breaks when practicing, for metal can be quite exhausting if you're not used to playing for long extensions of time. Try to practice daily, for at least an hour. Form a band if you know enough people who are into metal like you are.
Trees that are old or leaning, electrical wires, and power lines can be detrimental to the infrastructure of your home during earthquakes. The way to counter potential damage is to reinforce structures.For power lines and potential electric wires that might fall and cause damage, reinforce foundations and ceilings with concrete and plywood sheathing respectively to brace your house for falling objects. Consider removing or cutting down trees that could fall onto the home. Reinforcing your home with concrete for its foundation and plywood sheathing for your ceiling will help protect it, but so will ridding the surrounding area of things that could potentially fall and cause the damage you’re bracing it for.; , Look at walls, your chimney, foundation, and roof tiles to inspect them for any potential weaknesses. If you find that they have some, make those repairs before disaster strikes to prepare yourself for potential earthquake damage.Use additional plywood sheathing underneath chimneys to reinforce ceilings and prevent bricks and/or mortar from falling through the ceiling. Fix roof tiles that are loose and anchor heavy roofing material properly on a roof frame to ensure the roof is strongly braced. Add braces to chimneys to prevent it from falling over. Make sure that they are steel collar braces.  Earthquakes can potentially shift cripple walls, so bracing them is necessary to support the floor and exterior walls of the home.Add 2x4 boards between vertical studs at the top and bottom of a cripple wall to brace it securely against the foundation.  Secure the frame to the foundation by installing anchor bolts through the frame and into the foundation., Sill plates are the horizontal part of the wall that vertical architecture like walls is built on. It acts as a layer between the wall and the house’s foundation. If they aren’t bolted down, an earthquake can make the sill plates shift.Bolts need to be long enough to penetrate through the plate and several inches of foundation every six feet along the exterior walls. Hire a professional contractor to do this work for you, as it is extensive and must be done correctly.  Traditional, rectangular window frames are more susceptible to having their corners cracked and chipped as a result of pressure from the earthquake shifting the frames. Windows can be preserved if you round out the corners instead of using the default angled corners most windows come with., Secure wall hangings, bookshelves, computers, and entertainment centers with flexible fasteners. Have your refrigerator and your hot water heated bolted down to prevent gas lines from breaking if the quake causes them to fall over.	Evaluate elements outside the home that are potential hazards. Make any necessary repairs to your home. Add support to cripple walls. Build better walls to make your home more earthquake resistant.Add steel frames or plywood panels to offset structural problems from quake damage. Anchor sill plates properly to the foundation. Install windows with round corners. Restrain large equipment, furniture pieces, and appliances.
Bypass pruners have sharp, curved, scissors-type blades that overlap each other, while other types like anvil pruners have straight upper blades that cut against flat, lower plates.Although anvil pruners are usually cheaper than bypass ones, they will crush the stems of the roses. So avoid using anvil-type pruners and dull pruners to prune roses., They should also have thick rubber or canvas along the palms and undersides of the fingers for protection against rose thorns.  Clean any dirt off first and then soak them in disinfectant for 5 minutes.   Wipe the disinfectant off the pruners with a clean rag before using them as it will damage the rose stems. If the roses have a disease that has been causing spots on the leaves, stems or flowers or distorted growth, disinfect the pruners between pruning cuts so that healthy stems do not get infected., If you are removing a smaller branch, take the entire branch off all the way back to the main stem. If a main stem or cane is diseased, cut off only the diseased part.  Seal the wound on the stem with white glue like Elmer’s glue if it is thicker than a pencil to keep boring beetles out of the stems., They will rub against each other when the wind blows, causing open wounds and an opportunity for disease.   Cut off the weaker of the two branches and seal the wound.  Suckers are stems that grow from below where the rose with desirable characteristics was grafted or attached to the rootstock.   Most roses, except mini roses, are grafted. Sucker stems that grow from the rootstock will bloom in a different color, if they bloom at all.  Deadheading is the practice of removing the flowers as they fade. This procedure allows the rose to devote its energy toward new, healthy growth rather than producing seeds.   When deadheading the rose, the entire flower must be removed., This is where a growth bud that will produce strong, healthy stem growth is located.   If the flower is deadheaded higher up the stem, the new growth will be weak and unable to support the weight of a new flower, if it is even able to produce a new flower.  There is no need to seal the cut stems as they will not be thick enough for borers to enter.   Flower stems can be cut further down at the next leaf with five leaflets for long-stemmed roses to put in a vase.  If the growth bud, a small, raised patch of tissue on the stem, is located on the outside of the stem, the new growth will grow out away from the center of the bush. If it is located on the inside of the stem, new growth will grow toward the inside of the bush.  Put the trimmings in the garbage.Leaving dead flowers and pruned off bits of stem on the ground around a rose bush will promote disease and harbor insects that may attack the bush.	Use sharp scissor-type bypass pruners. Wear gardening gloves that have long cuffs to cover your wrists. Use a household disinfectant like Lysol to disinfect the pruners before and after using them. Prune out dead and diseased branches throughout the summer. Make the cut about 1 inch below the diseased section where the cane is healthy. Remove branches growing at odd angles across other branches at the center of the rose bush. Prune suckers off as soon as they appear. Deadhead roses throughout the summer. Locate the first leaf with five leaflets on the stem below the flower. Use sharp pruners to snip the stem ¼ inch above the leaf. Cut the stems further down to control the direction of the new growth. Use a grass rake to remove any trimmings that fall to the ground around the rose bush.
You will need hydrochloric and nitric acids. You will also need a filter to filter out contaminants. Finally you are going to need an oxidizing reagent.   Wear goggles and gloves when working with this method.  Aqua regia is Latin for “royal water.” This solution is used to remove gold from a scrap of metal or an ore. To make it, mix one part hydrochloric acid and three parts nitric acid.For example, 400 mL of aqua regia will contain 100 mL of hydrochloric acid and 300 mL of nitric acid. Use gloves, goggles, and caution when making and using aqua regia. It is highly corrosive and toxic. Aqua regia cannot be stored well. A new batch must be made for each use.  Submerge the metal sample in aqua regia. Stir and swirl to dissolve the sample. Non-metal minerals may not dissolve. These minerals will form a sludge.  Pour the sludge solution through a filter. The sludge will remain on one side of the filter and the aqua regia solution containing the metals will pass through to the other side. The solution is usually greenish in color and will contain many dissolved metals such as gold, silver, and copper., The nitric acid must be removed before the gold can be taken out of solution. You can do this by boiling the solution. Do not breath in the fumes.Do this outside or under a fume hood.  The gold must be forced out of solution. To do this, you must use a reducing agent. Oxalic acid is commonly used for this. After precipitating, the gold will a solid that sinks to the bottom of the solution., Strain the gold from the aqua regia solution and dry it. Weigh the gold on a scale. The weight of the gold can be compared to the weight of the original sample to determine the ratio of gold to other metals and minerals.	Gather the needed reagents. Mix acids to form aqua regia. Dissolve the sample. Filter the sample. Remove nitric acid. Precipitate the gold. Collect and weigh the gold.
First and foremost, you should be aware that Euro bills come only in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500. So, if you are handed a €15 note, reject it immediately. Each legitimate Euro denomination also has a standard color palette and image style.Euros feature distinctive styles of architectural imagery from different periods of European history. The front of each bill shows a window, door, or gate motif; the rear, a bridge (along with a map of Europe). Five Euro bills feature Classical architecture and are predominantly gray in color. Ten Euro bills feature Romanesque architecture and are predominantly red in color. Twenty Euro bills feature Gothic architecture and are predominantly blue in color. Fifty Euro bills feature Renaissance architecture and are predominantly orange in color. One-hundred Euro bills feature Baroque / Rococo architecture and are predominantly green in color. Two-hundred Euro bills feature iron and glass architecture and are predominantly yellow-brown in color. Five-hundred Euro bills feature Modern architecture and are predominantly purple in color.; , Unlike U.S. currency, for instance, Euro bills are different sizes. This hinders counterfeiting somewhat, but is mainly done for the benefit of the visually-impaired.€5 = 120 x 62 mm €10 = 127 x 67 mm €20 = 133 x 72 mm €50 = 140 x 77 mm €100 = 147 x 82 mm €200 = 153 x 82 mm €500 = 160 x 82 mm  , Euros are made of 100% cotton fiber, which enhances durability and gives the bills a distinctive feel. Real Euros should feel crisp and firm, and the print should feel raised in areas where the ink is thicker.Fake Euros tend to feel limp and waxy to the touch, and often lack the raised print texture. The older and more worn the Euro bill is, the more difficult it may be to distinguish these features. Even then, however, an experienced handler of Euros can likely tell the difference.  The European Central Bank has over the past few years been slowly rolling out a new series of Euro bills. These are widely known as the Europa Series because some of the major security enhancements involve imagery of the Greek mythological figure Europa.These bills include a watermark portrait of Europa (a female), visible when the bill is held up to light. They also include a hologram image of Europa in the silver security stripe, which becomes visible when the bill is tilted.	Recognize proper styles and colors. Measure the bills. Feel the distinctive paper. Look out for the Europa Series.
Ask yourself" : "Do I really want to be in it? Will I be able to dedicate the time needed for it?" If you get into the show, you will have to give up a lot of your personal time. Moreover, dropping out is simply not an option, as you'll be letting down the rest of the cast. Be absolutely certain this is the right choice for you at this point in time.; , You won't be able to get a lead or supporting role if you don't have self confidence. To build up your self confidence, recognize your flaws and insecurities and learn to love them because they are a part of you. Start feeling good about yourself. A good actor/actress only needs to please herself/himself.  If there's a movie based on it, watch it. If there's a soundtrack, listen to it. Read the book it's based on too, if applicable. Know what the characters are all about and know which one of the lead characters you want to play.   Go online, and look for scripts, you can even watch a little bit on Youtube, if you find the play or musical.  As soon as you walk into the first audition, you've already started your audition. Practice demonstrating good posture and volunteer in exercises.  You will need to know when and where the audition will be taking place. Sometimes nerves can do funny things to you and cause you to get lost, so also know exactly how to get to the place where the audition is being held.  You may be able to choose it yourself but normally it's a set piece, maybe an extract from the script.  On the day of the audition, be on time or perhaps even 10 minutes early. If waiting near other people auditioning bothers you, at least be at the building and find your own quiet corner away from the others.  Before you sing your audition piece, warm up your vocal chords.  If you're asked to sing any random song for the audition, don't sing overused songs. The director has probably listening to these songs all day and if you sing it too, they'll probably skip over you. Also never sing a song in the play! That's basically audition suicide. It just shows you are really desperate for the character who sings that songs role.  Speak loudly and clearly, the director needs to know how loud you can be. You're never too loud in theatre.   Also walk in with the attitude of your character you would like to play. If you are auditioning for the villain you can walk in with a mysterious look.  Suggest the character you want to play in your dress (i.e. if you were trying out for Sharpay in High School Musical you might want to wear bright pink.) This helps the director(s) see you as that character. But don't overdo it! Full costumes are usually not appropriate for auditions. Also, too much may give you a slight reputation of being desperate or needy.  Most acting auditions are cold readings. So when given a scene to audition with, look it over until you almost have it memorized. If you're doing a scene with another person, talk to them to help your chemistry on stage. Take the script pages you have to read out of the script, if possible, so that your body is given more freedom to act.   When reading, hold the pages away from your face, so your words don't get blocked out by having something in front of your face. Don't forget to look at the person you are reading with. Get into the character you are reading. Whilst others are auditioning make sure you are reading your audition piece. Look at the people auditioning and see what people like and what they don't like so much.  If you are seen distracting others or being disrespectful, the directors won't want you in their production. Directors look for things off stage too, if you're quiet in your seat, how you react to certain things, and lots more, so be on your best behavior.  No matter how nervous you are, never show it. The director wants someone who is not afraid to be big and out going in front of an audience that can act.  Even if you don't get a lead, which you will if you've followed these steps, be a good sport about the role you did get. "There's never small parts, just small actors!" If you have a good attitude and do your best with the part you get, the director will remember. In the future, he or she might give you a bigger role.   Even if you don't get the part that you wanted, congratulate the person who got the part you wanted. It shows that you are a nice person. Don't worry if you don't get a main part, they'll want to see how well you do with a smaller part first. This is especially true if this is your first performance.	Be certain that you actually want the role. Build up your self confidence. Become familiar with the play/musical you are planning to try out for. Work on having a strong presence. Be well informed well in advance of the audition. Find out what your audition piece will be. Be punctual. Warm up. Don't sing bad songs!, Try to stand out in the crowd. Dress the part. Digest the script as best you can in the time allotted. Be respectful, polite and considerate. Try to show confidence rather than nerves. Be proud when you get your role.
There are many different kinds of yarn that you can crochet with. The type of yarn you pick will depend on the type of project you are doing. If this is your first time trying to crochet, it is best to stick with a simple, plain yarn made of cotton or soft acrylic yarn. Choose a solid color for the yarn so that as you're learning, you can see how the stitches are made--patterned yarn would make this more difficult.Soft acrylic yarn: This type of yarn is less expensive than other yarns, which makes it good for beginners who are just learning new patterns. Try to avoid the absolute cheapest yarn when you do begin making projects to give away, as many cheap yarns can be scratchy (and who wants a scratchy scarf?) 100% Cotton yarn: Cotton yarn is good for making things that you think will get washed a lot (such as dish towels.) Cotton yarn is absorbent and easy to wash. Novelty yarn: This yarn is the most varied and generally the most expensive. Novelty yarn can be made of very soft, fine wool that results in deliciously soft sweaters and scarves. Keep in mind that this kind of yarn can’t be washed as often as cotton yarn.; , These days, almost every yarn has label on it that will tell you which size hook to use. If you do not own any hooks and this is your first time crocheting, purchase the size hook that the yarn you would like to work with recommends. Hook sizes are measured in millimetres or fractions of an inch.          As a general rule, the thicker the hook, the thicker the yarn will need to be.  While there is no right way to hold a crochet hook, there are two basic styles which can be reversed, depending on which is your dominant hand. Holding the hook incorrectly can lead to your hand cramping.         Using the Over-the-Hook position: Hold the hook so that the handle rests against your palm, like a pencil. Your hand should go over the hook with your thumb and index finger placed so that they are grasping the thumb rest (an indentation in the handle.) Using the Under-the-Hook position: Hold the hook like you are holding a spatula. Your hand should be under the hook with your thumb and forefinger placed on the thumb rest.  As you're learning, your tension may vary. Before you begin a pattern, make a test swatch. A test swatch is when you practice a specific stitch without trying to make anything--you are simply practicing how to do the stitch while also figuring out your preference on how tight or loose you would like your stitch to be.  Every crochet project begins with a chain stitch, usually abbreviated as ch in instruction pamphlets. Practice crocheting a chain for about 10 to 15 minutes a day until you are able to hold the yarn so that it is not too loose or too tight.           Form a slip knot around the hook, and wrap the yarn around the hook. To make a slipknot, make a loop with your yarn so that the tail of the yarns hangs down behind the loop. Guide the hook through the loop under the tail and then back out of the loop. Pull the tail, which will tighten the yarn around the hook, making a slipknot.Use your thumb and middle finger of your left hand (if you’re right-handed) to hold the end of the slipknot. Use your left index finger to guide the yarn from the back to the front around the handle of the hook. Use the hook to pull the yarn through the loop on the hook--one chain link will form. Repeat this process to make a chain stitch.,          Make a chain stitch that is six chain links long. Slide the hook through the first chain link you made--doing this should form a ring. (The first chain link is the one furthest away from the hook, since you made it first.)With the hand you use to move the yarn (not your dominant hand) wrap the yarn around the hook from back to the front. At the same time, rotate the hook so that it’s throat (so the tip of the hook is facing you.) Pull the yarn and hook back through the stitch and then through the loop on the hook. This completes one slip stitch.  Draw a new loop through the chain stitch (but not through the loop that is already on the hook). You should now have two loops on the hook. Pull a new loop of yarn through both, remaining with a single loop. Repeat.          Single crochet is a relatively tight stitch and will result in a more closely stitched material.    , Double crochet stitches are great for making sweaters and scarves because they are a bit looser than other stitches (so your sweaters will be more comfy.)          Make a chain with 15 chain links in it. Yarn over the hook from front to back. Slide your hook between the first two front loops and under the fourth chain link from the hook. Yarn over the hook again. Pull the wrapped yarn through the chain stitch by gently guiding the wrapped hook through the chain. This should result in having three loops on your hook. Pull your hook through the first two loops on the hook. Yarn over the hook again and then pull the hook through the last two loops on the hook. Your double crochet is complete. Repeat.  Turning chains are helpful when you want to change direction with your stitch.  Crocheting in the round allows you to create circular things like hats and coasters.  Granny squares are what allowed your grandma to whip together a crocheted blanket in the blink of an eye.  Have a lot of clothing and old blankets that are dear to you but pretty worn down?

Before you decide on a vehicle to purchase, you should know its cost and the prices available at multiple dealerships. This can help you decide if the vehicle you're considering is within your price range, and you can then find the best offer in your region.It's worth comparing multiple manufacturers, models, and dealers to get the best price for the car you want. Check the Kelley Blue Book to get an estimate of the going price for that vehicle or vehicles. Then compare the prices at a number of dealerships to find the best selling price in your area. Use an online auto loan calculator to figure out how much you'll need to finance the vehicle you want. You can find one by searching online, or try using the United States Automobile Association's auto loan calculator at: https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/bank_loan_advanced_calculator_auto_page?akredirect=true ; , Your credit score is comprised of your payment history (35%), amounts you've owed (30%), the length of your credit history (15%), how many different types of credit you have in use (10%), and how many account inquiries you've made (10%).It will also include a credit diagnosis and a summary of each line of credit you have open.Knowing your credit score can help you negotiate better loan terms, instead of having to accept whatever loan offer you're given.Your credit score can affect the amount of interest that you will have to pay on an auto loan. A poor credit score may result in a high interest rate, while a good credit score may result in a lower interest rate. Make sure you know your credit score before you ever walk into a dealership. You can learn your credit score for free by using online sources like Credit Karma, or get your free annual credit score through a major reporting agency like Equifax or Experian. Visit AnnualCreditReport.com or call 1-877-322-8228 to find out more information.  Once you know your credit score, you can shop around for a better loan. It's best to do this before going to a dealership, as this gives you a better idea of what your options are.You're not under any obligation to take the loan offer that the auto dealership gives you. If you go to the dealership with other loan quotes, you may be able to negotiate for a better loan from the dealer. If not, you can simply turn down the dealer's loan and go with the better loan. You can find loan offers through banks, local credit unions, or even an online lender. Just make sure you research the lender to ensure that they are a legitimate business with good terms and interest rates.  If you have bad credit, you may be worried about what your options are. Just because you have bad credit, it doesn't mean you have to take the first loan that you're offered. There are plenty of options available for you, if you're willing to shop around.Most credit unions are local institutions that work within your community. Credit unions tend to offer more flexible payment plans and lower interest rates, even if you have bad credit. You may also want to consider a peer-to-peer lending service like Lending Club. You can get a better interest rate, but the evaluation process is thorough, with only about 10% of applicants getting approved.  Once you receive a loan offer, you'll want to look into the conditions of that loan and decide if it's right for you. There are plenty of aspects to consider, but the most important are the interest rate, the down payment requirement, and the term of the loan.The interest rate is how much extra you'll be paying for taking out the loan, applied as an annual percentage rate (APR). The term of the loan is how long you have to repay the loan, usually calculated in months. Some lenders charge a prepayment penalty if you pay off your loan before the end of the loan term, as this loses the lender money in interest. For example, if you took out a 60-month loan but paid it off in 50 months, the lender loses the interest that would have accrued over the remaining 10 months, and may charge you a penalty.It's worth comparing all aspects of the loan. A lower interest rate is good and may tempt you, but if it requires a higher downpayment and several extra months on the loan term, you may end up paying more.  If you're in a pinch, you can always ask a friend or family member for a loan. Financial issues can create a lot of tension between friends/relatives, so it's important to proceed with caution.Ask politely and respectfully. Say something like, "Could we work out an arrangement where I borrow $_____ from you? That way I could pay a lower interest rate than a bank would charge, and I can pay you back a higher interest rate than your money would have accrued in a savings account." If your friend/relative is reluctant, you can always offer to put your vehicle up as collateral. But if you do so, be aware that you'll need to pay back the loan or your friend may actually take your vehicle. Savings accounts usually offer interest rates below 5%. Offering your friend/relative an interest rate on the loan around 5% to 6% would be fair and beneficial to everyone.Determine how long it will take you to repay the loan, and work out a reasonable repayment schedule with your friend/relative. Put the agreement in writing, including the repayment schedule, and sign it to make it a binding promissory note.  Depending on your situation, refinancing may be a wonderful option. It can help you get a better loan, but it may only be worth it if certain circumstances have changed since you took out your existing loan.If interest rates have dropped by more than a few points, it may be worth refinancing your loan. If you've improved your credit score since you took out your loan, refinancing will most likely help you get a better loan. If your personal financial situation has gone downhill and you need to lower your payments, refinancing can help you get a better monthly rate.  There are certain restrictions and limitations to refinancing. Not everyone qualifies for a refinanced loan. In order to decide if you're eligible, a financial institution will evaluate your financial situation, the terms of your existing loan, and/or your vehicle.You will typically need a 6 to 12 month history of on-time loan payments to qualify. Check to see if there are any prepayment penalties on your existing loan. If there are, you'll have to pay that penalty should you choose to refinance. If your vehicle is past a certain age or if your existing loan is outside a predetermined range (set by the financial institution), you may not be eligible to refinance your loan., Once you've made the decision to refinance and you know that you're eligible, you'll want to shop around to find the best offer. This should require just as much investigative work on your end as you would put into getting a new loan, so be sure you assess all of your available options.Check with numerous lenders to find the best interest rate that you qualify for. During the application process, if you choose "auto pay" for your repayment options, you may get the lowest possible interest rate. If you're able to pay the new loan off sooner, it may be worth shortening the term of the new loan you receive. This will help you save money on interest rates.	Research the vehicle's cost. Check your credit score. Shop around for other quotes. Know your options with bad credit. Evaluate a loan. Ask a friend/relative for a loan. Assess whether refinancing would help.

A scan tool reads information from your On-board Diagnostics, version II (OBD-II) system. This system collects information from the sensors in your engine. If the sensor detects something wrong, it reports it as an error code to the OBD-II. A scan tool allows you to read this code. The scan tool plugs into OBD-II data link connector, which is usually located under the dash., The most common location for the OBD-II connector is under the dash by the steering wheel. The owner's manual should have the exact location if you have trouble finding it.  Place your key in the ignition and turn it to on, but do not start the engine. You only want the electrical systems running.  The scan tool will prompt you to fill in some information about your vehicle. It usually requires information about the make, model, engine, and year of the vehicle.   Most scan tools draw power from the vehicle’s battery and do not require a separate power source.  The scan tool will display any error codes the OBD-II reports. If the result is in the P0400 to PR409 range, then the EGR valve may be faulty.	Use a car scan to test the EGR valve. Locate the OBD-II data connector. Turn the ignition to the on position. Connect the scan tool to the OBD-II data link connector. Read the results.
If your soil pH tested below 7, add dolomite or quick lime to the soil. Wood ash in moderation helps as well. Both are available at local gardening centers.  If your soil pH tested above 7, add organic matter such as pine needles, peat moss, decomposed tree leaves. Sulfur is very effective as well.  For example, add sulfur to a certain area of your garden to encourage beautiful blue blooms on your hydrangeas, which prefer more acidic soils. The pH of your soil does not need to be uniform your entire garden over; feel free to alter it to support different plants.	Make your soil less acidic. Make your soil less alkaline. Change your soil pH to suit specific plants.
The original illustrations by Tenniel in the book were black and white with no specific color scheme, though light blue is still the most traditional color in subsequent editions.   The first edition with colored illustrations, called The Nursery Alice, featured Alice wearing a yellow dress. While this is an authentic and viable alternative to a blue dress it might not be instantly recognizable to others.In some early editions of Through the Looking Glass, the sequel to the first book, Alice is wearing a red frock. Like a yellow dress, this may not instantly signal to others that you are dressed as Alice., In the book, Alice wears a small apron, also called a pinafore. The illustrations by Tenniel show a white pinafore some trimming around the edge, which in some editions is colored blue. Consider adding some ribbon to your apron if you want to look more like the books., The book illustrations offer more freedom in depicting Alice because they originally had no color, so you could select any shade you think goes well with your dress.   One early edition added blue stockings to go with a yellow dress.In Through the Looking Glass, Alice wears stockings that have horizontal stripes, sometimes colored in blue and white. For an individual flare, wear striped stockings instead., In the original book illustrations, Alice did not have a headband. Tenniel added that detail in the sequel Through the Looking Glass. Decide which book you would like to imitate, and add a headband if you like the look.If you go without a headband, tuck your hair behind your ears and wear it loose around your shoulders, if it is long enough.	Choose a dress. Add an apron. Decide on tights. Decide whether to wear a headband.

Use sharp gardening scissors to cut all of the flowers that fall under the water line because it can promote decay in your flowers.Remove any leaves or flower petals that look bruised. If you have roses, do not remove the thorns as this has been shown to reduce the lifetime of the flowers.   Failing to remove damaged leaves or leaves that are under the water line can promote bacterial growth in your vase., Most flowers thrive with lukewarm water because the warm water molecules move faster than cold water molecules and make it easier for the stem to absorb water. As a rule of thumb, keep your water at 100°F to 110°F (37.7°C to 43.3°C).While this applies to most flowers, there are exceptions to this rule. Bulb flowers like hyacinths and tulips need cold water to survive., Bacterial growth and microorganisms thrive inside of a vase. Replace the water in your vase every two to three days to prevent this from happening. Scrub down the sides with a soft dish soap and remember to rinse it thoroughly before placing your flowers back into the vase. Other than promoting decay in your plant, certain bacteria are capable of entering a flower's stem and stopping water absorption as well.If you are using a chemical floral preservative, make sure to replace the nutrients as well as the water. Use a bottle brush for a vase with a thin neck. If you are having trouble getting to the crevices of your vessel, mix up a solution containing one part household bleach with ten parts water and allow the vase to soak overnight. Air dry your vase before refilling it with water.  Hot and cold drafts can promote water loss in your plant and exposure to direct sunlight can cause it to use up all of its stored food.Set them in a cool place in your house that isn't near things like a radiator, television sets, or hot ovens., Commercial grade floral preservatives are available at most home and gardening, hardware, and florist shops. They contain a biocide which prevents bacterial growth, an acidifier which promotes water absorption, and sugar that acts as the plant's food.Replace the flower preservatives when you change the water in your vase.   Use recommended measurements when using floral preservatives. Homemade flower preservatives usually have mixed results and should be avoided.	Remove bruised leaves and any leaves that are under the water line. Use lukewarm water to water your flowers. Change the water every two days and clean the vase. Keep flowers away from air drafts and direct sunlight. Purchase commercial grade floral preservatives.

Using a fertilizer will encourage your wisteria to blossom. You can find phosphate fertilizer from an online retailer, or you can find it in a local or a big box store.  You should only do this in the early spring, such as April. When you have the fertilizer in your possession, read the instructions on the package and heed any warnings.   If you have plenty of time to fertilize, use a natural fertilizer and apply it to the surface of the soil. This method takes a longer time to release nutrients into the soil. If you are short on time to fertilize, use a water soluble fertilizer. This is a fluid solution that is dissolved in water and is sprayed onto the soil and the plants. Many times, when struggling to get a wisteria to bloom, too much nitrogen is the culprit. Adding phosphorus to the soil will balance the nitrogen already present in the soil and will encourage the wisteria to blossom.  Each spring, you should add compost to the soil around the wisteria. Apply a two-inch covering of mulch on top of the compost. This will retain moisture and deter weeds from growing around the plant.   Wisteria grows best in fertile, moist, well-drained soil.You can make your own compost or purchase compost from a gardening store. You can also make your own mulch.	Purchase a phosphate fertilizer. Add the phosphate fertilizer to the soil. Add compost to the soil.

Look for the keyword "pull-on pants" and a pattern with no zippers or pockets. Ideal patterns can be found in the Pants and Skirts, Sleepwear, and Men's/Unisex sections of most pattern catalogs.; , Sewing pattern sizes are determined by measurements. You will need to know your waist and hip measurement to figure out the correct size.  The pattern envelope will include recommendations on the kind and amount of fabric you will need. Fabric store employees are always happy to make recommendations, as well.   Choose a fabric that is easy to work with for this project. Fabrics without much stretch are easier to work with than knits. A cute flannel or a cotton print would make a great choice for a pair of pants. Be sure to note the care instructions for the fabric you choose; these will be printed on the end of the fabric bolt.  These will also be specified on the pattern envelope. You will usually need between 2.5 to 3 yards (2.3 to 2.7 m) of fabric, depending on the width of the fabric.   Purchase a spool of thread that will match or coordinate with your fabric. Look for a variety marked "all purpose" or "sew-all." Purchase a package of 3/4-inch elastic for the waistband.  It is important to prewash the fabric before you begin to cut and sew to minimize shrinkage, and to remove fabric sizing and excess dye. Make sure to prewash new fabric separately from other garments to avoid staining your clothes!Machine sew a quick straight stitch 1/2 away from each cut edges of the fabric before washing to prevent loosely-knit fabric from unraveling. Wash and dry the fabric according to the care instructions. For cotton fabrics, including flannel, machine wash in warm water using your normal detergent, and machine dry on high., If you have your materials ready and your sewing station set up and ready to go, the actual construction of the pants will be a breeze!   Read the pattern instructions included in the envelope. Thread your sewing machine and load the bobbin with the thread you plan to use. Set up your ironing board, or prepare an ironing surface. You can lay out several layers of towels on the floor or table to iron on in a pinch. Prepare a surface for cutting out the pattern and fabric. Remember that scissors can leave dents on wooden surfaces, so you may want to use a sheet of cardboard or a tablecloth to protect your dining room table.  Your pants pattern should consist of a "front" and "back" leg piece. Cut the pattern pieces out carefully, following the lines for the desired size.   If the tissue paper pattern is heavily creased or wrinkled, you can iron it with a dry iron on low heat to smooth it out before cutting. Diamonds or triangle tabs on the edge of the pattern will be used later to match up pieces of fabric. Take care not to cut them off. , Most patterns will instruct you to fold the fabric in half before cutting. This way, you end up cutting out two pieces of cloth at once, one for the right leg and one for the left.  If your fabric is doubled-up, make sure the pins go completely through both layers., Cut through both layers of fabric at the same time, and be sure to cut diamonds or notches where they are marked on the pattern paper.  You should end up with 4 pieces of fabric: two "fronts" and two "backs," one for each pant leg.  Use a tape measure to measure your waist, then cut a piece of 3/4-inch elastic that is 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than this length.  Match up one front and one back leg and place them together with right sides facing. The "right" side of the fabric is the side that is worn outside the body, i.e. the part that people will see.   Align the edges and all notches, and pin together the inside and outside seams. Completely pin up both legs before you start sewing to make sure that everything is matched up correctly. You should end up with two inside-out fabric tubes that are mirror images of one another.  Sew the outer seam of each pant leg first. Then sew the inner seams of each pant leg. Alternately, you could sew one leg up completely, and then do the other.  This is an important step to make sure the two legs can be joined together smoothly, and that you don't create awkward bunches and twists at the seams., Begin by turning one sewn pant leg right side out, then insert this pant leg into the other, so that right sides of the fabric are touching. Now pin the crotch seam of the two pant legs together, making sure that all seams and notches are aligned. (The crotch seam will look like a "U" in shape.)  , For extra durability, you can also use a heavy-duty stitch, or add a second row of stitching 1/8" away from the first.  You are nearly done with your pair of pants!  , Fold the top of the pants down 1/4" and press, then fold down another 1 1/4" and press again. Stitch 1/8" from the bottom of the casing, all the way around the pants, leaving a 2" gap to insert the elastic.  Attach a large safety pin to one end of the elastic, and use this to thread the elastic into the casing you have made at the top of the pants. You can also use a bodkin for this task.   Stitch the ends of the elastic together using a zig-zag stitch. Make sure you have no twists in your elastic first! Finish the waistband by sewing the gap you left for the elastic closed.  First try on the pants to decide how long you want them to be. A helper at this stage can come in really handy! Mark the desired length of the pants with pins or a washable fabric marker.   If the unfinished pants are more than an inch longer than you'd like them to be, trim off the excess material at the bottom. Fold the bottom of each pant leg over 1/4" and press, then fold them over another 3/4" and press again. Pin the hems, and sew 1/2" from the bottom of the pants. (The pants should still be inside-out for this step!)  , Be sure to remove all pins and turn the pants right side out before putting them on.	Choose a sewing pattern for basic elastic-waist pants. Choose the correct pattern size. Choose a fabric for your pants. Buy the fabric and notions needed to complete your project. Prewash your fabric. Get ready to sew while the fabric is being laundered. Cut out the pattern. Iron the fabric so it will lay flat on your cutting surface.  , Lay out the fabric on your cutting surface and position the pattern pieces on top, according to the pattern directions. Pin the pattern paper to the fabric with straight pins, placed every 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm), or as often as you need to keep the pattern securely attached. Cut out the fabric pieces using a pair of sharp scissors. Remove the pins from the cut pieces. Cut a piece of elastic for the waistband. Match up the pattern pieces and pin them together. Sew up each pant leg using a straight stitch, 1/2" from the edge of the fabric. Remove the pins, and press all seams open with your iron. Join the two pant legs together. Sew the crotch seam with a straight stitch. Turn the pants inside out and press the crotch seam open. Create a casing at the top of the pants for the elastic. Insert the elastic into the casing. Hem the pants. Proudly wear your new pants!
Use dead wood chips, much sunlight and good air circulation as optimal growth conditions for your plant.       Remember that the tree does not retain water, and has plenty of air around it. Provide lots of drainage and holes (if in a pot) for air flow.   Use any spray bottle for misting.       Avoid using chlorinated or “softened” water. These do not exist in the natural habitat and are both harsh on the plant.    If your house in winter uses heat, use either an orchid cage or terrarium to increase humidity.   Do this several times per year as the sun changes position throughout the year.       Remember, the dendrobium needs natural sunlight.   Use a basket and hang towards the outer part of a tree or overhang on a porch.   After being indoors, they, like people, can burn if moved too quickly into a great deal of natural light.    In their natural habitat roots are used to collect dead insects, dust, rotting tree matter as a food source.   Use orchid fertilizer in a mister once every three months.       Too much fertilizer will burn the roots, so fertilize only as directed.       Do not attempt to push your orchid with too much fertilizing.   Two to three times per week of rain or mist is normal and the average.   Do not change how your orchid is planted more than absolutely required.     Too much “fussing” about the orchid is how most people kill them.       Give the orchid simulated optimal conditions and except for misting, leave it alone.	Imitate the conditions of the natural habitat. Let the dendrobium dry in between misting. Keep high relative humidity. Adjust the orchid container. Move the plant outside during the summer. Move the plant gradually. Ensure that the orchid receives nutrition. Fertilization must be done artificially if grown indoors. Water outside only if there is a drought. Disturbing the orchid is detrimental.
Ideally, Aloe Vera should get 8 to 10 hours of sunlight each day. You can get this by placing it in a south or west-facing window. If necessary, move the plant from window to window throughout the day.         If it is cold where you live, move the plant away from the windows at night. These areas tend to get very cold, which can kill your plant., When you do water the plant, make sure that the soil is completely soaked through. Also, make sure that the water is draining freely from the pot.Do not over-water your plant.          Aloe Vera tends to go dormant during the winter months. It won't need as much water.Aloe Vera will need more water during the summer months, especially when it is hot and dry.  The fertilizer should be water-based, and heavy in phosphorus. Prepare the mix at half strength.  Use a natural, organic pesticide to keep pests, such as mealy bugs and scale, at bay. You can avoid fungus easily simply by keeping the soil dry.  They are great indicators of health, and what your Aloe Vera needs.          Aloe vera leaves should be plump and straight. If you notice the leaves becoming thin and curly, give your Aloe Vera more water. Aloe Vera leaves should grow straight up. If the leaves droop, the plant needs more sun.  Sometimes, Aloe Vera does not grow well. Fortunately, it is easy to figure out what is wrong. It is even easier to fix these common problems.         The soil is too damp. Water the plant less often. The plant needs more sunlight. Move it to a sunnier spot. You added too much fertilizer. Move the plant to a new pot and add more soil. The soil might be too alkaline. Add some soil sulfur. The plant doesn't have enough room for its roots. Move it to a bigger pot.	Make sure that your plant gets plenty of bright sunlight. Wait until the soil is completely dry before you water it again. Fertilize once a year during spring. Watch out for bugs, disease, and fungus. Watch the leaves. Know what to do if your plant grows too slowly.
Barre chords are adaptable, slide across the neck, and come in set forms that you can learn relatively quickly. They take some stretching to get used to, however.          Barre chords, like power chords, get their name based on your index finger's position. If it is on a G, the chord is a G. Barre chords come in "forms," meaning that once you learn how to set one up, you can move it anywhere across the neck to go from Gm7 to Am7, or a B major to a C major.  Your index finger on the top string determines the chord, just like with power chords. When done, place the ring finger on the fifth string two frets down, where the green dot is.  Place the little (4th) finger just below it, on the fourth string (still two frets up from the bar). Put the middle finger on the 3rd string 1 fret up from the bar. This form can now be moved anywhere across the top string to form a major chord. A G major bar chord looks like this in tab:          --3-- --3-- --4-- --5-- --5-- --3-- To make the chord minor, simply remove your middle finger (the 4th fret) and leave it barred.  All your fingers go one string below where they were for the major barre chord. Don't play the 6th string. The top note (root) is now on the 5th string. Now, wherever your index finger is on the 5th string becomes the chord -- if it is on a C, the chord is a C minor. The rest of the E-chord shape stays the same, so a C major might look like this:          --3-- --4-- --5-- --5-- --3-- --X--  , Seventh chords, whether open or barred, are the blues chords. They are melodic, but still a little sad. Whenever you want this old-school, bluesy feel, you want major seventh chords.          --3-- --3-- --4-- --3-- --5-- --3--  , Just like moving from a major to a minor chord, you can move from a major 7th (A7) to a minor 7th (Am7) by either lifting your finger on the third string or by dropping the whole form down a string. Remember that if you drop the form, the new chord is based on your root note or index finger placement. So a Cm7 could look like:          --3-- --4-- --3-- --5-- --3-- --X--Or  --8-- --8-- --9-- --8-- --10-- --8--  , Purists will tell you to play these major chords on 5 strings, to get the high E string in there. This is great if you can be bothered with the more difficult fingering involved, but if not, you can 'cheat' and dump the high E, making the hand position a great deal easier to pull off. To do this, just bar the middle 4 strings (A, D, G, and B) with the first finger, and then bar the D, G, and B strings with the ring finger two frets up.          Here's how a C major chord looks in tab (X = don't play this string):  --X-- --5-- --5-- --5-- --3-- --X--   These chords strike a nice balance between the indifferent-sounding power chords and the big old 6 string bar monsters. They won't turn into mud even under a good bit of gain, but they still sound like 'real chords.' They are nice for those rhythm parts where you roll back the guitar's volume knob a bit and provide backing for the vocalist or another guitarist.	Use barre chords to play minors, majors, sevenths, and much more anywhere on the neck. Bar across all 6 strings with your first finger, covering every string on that fret. Set the rest of your fingers up as if you were playing an open E chord to play a major barre chord. To make a minor chord, move the whole form down one string, ignoring the top string. Play a seventh barre chord by simply removing your pinky finger from a major barre chord. Drop the 7th down a string or remove your ring finger to make a minor 7th. Drop the bottom strings if you're having trouble nailing barre chords at first.
Choose straw colors that reflect the occasion.  Select a straw length of about 10cm (4"). You might need to cut it to size. Press along the length of the straw to fold in place a single line, as shown in the image.  First, check this diagram and use it as a reference for each cut.  Cut the middle, thick piece first. Use the diagram and image to guide your cutting.      Cut the lower blue line from the diagram, as shown in the image.       Finish up by cutting the jagged edges at one end.  See the image for guidance.  Again, use the images for guidance.   This should be how the "petals" end up appearing:        ,  Once curled, this is how the curl will appear:        , In order for the star straw to be able to sit on the glass rim, there needs to be a small slit to slide the straw onto the glass. Make a small snip to create this grip at the end of the straw.  Using the small pearl bead or similar bead, fit into place in the center of the hole in the straw, to form the star's center.  It should fit snugly, as shown in this image. If it's loose at all, you might need to use non-toxic glue to keep it in place, to prevent it from dropping into the drink. Alternatively, use a small pompom that will squeeze easily into shape in the hole.       If you'd like a lively star, consider decorating it with a marker to include a smile.  It's now completed.  Fill with your drink and enjoy!	Select the items needed as listed below. Prepare the plastic straw. Make a series of cuts as explained in this step. Fold the jagged end cuts out like petals opening from a flower. Cut away a triangle from each "petal", so that the resulting petals are triangular in shape. Bend the shooting tail end of the star so that it curls into place. Cut the grip portion of the straw. Fill the hole at the star end of the straw. Check that you're happy with it and make any adjustments needed. Attach the shooting star decoration to the rim of the glass.
You will be pulling the flowers apart and rearranging them to make your own flowers. Get a few different types of flowers in different shapes, sizes, and colors so that you will have more shapes and colors to work with..   Great fake flowers to use include roses, chrysanthemums, and mums.  They should pop off easily. Discard the stems, as you won't be needing them. If you want, you can save the leaves for filler.  Pull the plastic nub off of the back of the flower. Then, pull the different layers apart. Discard the plastic stamen, center, and nub.   If you want, you can separate the petals into different groups based on shape, size, and color. This will keep your work area more organized and make it easier for you to find what you need.  Make sure that you keep the layers stacked. You can combine more of the same flower to create a fuller flower. You can also take out petals from a flower you don't like., Thread your needle and tie a knot at the bottom of the thread. Push the needle through the center of all of the petals, starting from the bottom flower. There should already be a hole in the center of each petal; use this hole as your guide.  Some beads have a very small opening, so you may need to switch out your sewing needle for a beading needle. Once you have the bead on the thread, switch back to a regular sewing needle. Beading needles are too delicate to go through all of those petals.Try using a pearl bead, or a faceted crystal bead.  Once you have your bead on the thread, hold it against the petal. Then, push the needle back through the petals again and tie a knot at the bottom.  This will make the flower more sturdier. The felt circle should be big enough to give the flower support, but small enough so that you won't see it when you look down at the flower.   Try to choose a color of felt that closely matches the color of your flower.  If you saved any of the leaves, glue those down onto the clip first. Then, glue the flower down.	Choose some fake flowers with multiple layers. Pull the fake flowers off the stem. Take the flowers apart completely. Rearrange the petals in new and interesting combinations. Pull a threaded needle through the center of the petal stack. String a pretty bead onto the needle. Push the needle back through the petals and tie the thread in a knot. Hot glue a small circle of felt to the back of your flower. Hot glue the flower onto the hair clip.
Make sure to use an extension cord that’s long enough to cover the area you will be trimming. Some weed whackers have a clip on the handle where you can loop the extension cord. This prevents it from disconnecting if it gets caught as you use the weed whacker.   Some electric weed whackers are battery powered. If this is the case, you’ll need to make sure you’ve charged the weed whacker before trying to start it.Make sure the trigger isn’t held down when plugging in the weed whacker.  The advantage of electric weed whackers is they’re ready to be used once they’ve been plugged in. The line will start spinning as soon as you pull the trigger. Make sure to keep the weed whacker away from you and any surface that could be damaged by it., While a gas powered weed whacker demands several steps before starting, electric weed whackers are much simpler. You won’t find a kill switch or a pull cord on an electric weed whacker. You should only need to pull the trigger to get it working.	Plug the weed whacker into an outlet. Pull the trigger. Note the differences between electric and gas powered weed whackers.
You may wish to place newspaper underneath, to catch any spills.; , If you've been storing used pieces for a while, use these. If not, you'll need to cut up block glycerine soaps into inch-sized cubes.    If you don't have a microwave oven, place in a double boiler for melting over the stove top.  Microwave on high for 30 seconds, at 10 second intervals. Check each time to see how much it has melted. When fully melted, remove from the microwave oven.  Put a few drops of each into the melted solution and stir to combine. ,, The soap will form in the mold shape as it cools.  Spritz with rubbing alcohol to prevent the formation of surface bubbles. Set aside to cool for 3 to 5 minutes.  This should be cool enough (below 130ºC) to not melt the first layer. Spray with rubbing alcohol.  Two layers is just fine, or you could perhaps make three.  It must be non-toxic and small. For example, a child-safe soft toy or a sponge shape. Special soap designs are made for this purpose, inquire at the craft store.  Spray with rubbing alcohol. Set aside to cool for 30 seconds.  Once again, spray with rubbing alcohol.  Add a colored background or leave it clear. Once cooled down, it's done.	Set up the soap molds in readiness for pouring before starting. Gather the glycerine soap pieces. Place the glycerine soap pieces or cubes into a microwave-proof bowl. Place the bowl of glycerine soap pieces into the microwave. Add colorant and fragrance oil to the melted soap. Pour the melted glycerine soap solution into the soap molds.  , Spray with rubbing alcohol to break any surface bubbles.  , Set aside and let cool for 30 minutes to one hour. Pour the first layer of melted soap into the molds, not all the way, though. Pour a second layer of melted, colored, (and scented if wished) soap onto the first layer of soap. Repeat until you form the final layer. Choose a suitable item for embedding. Pour melted blue-tinted clear glycerine into a mold. Place face down either a soap design or a soft child-safe toy. Set aside to cool for 3 to 5 minutes.
They should look like connected tree branches, or the skeleton of a bat's arm.; , They should be mostly oval-like in shape, overlapping one another but not going beyond three rows or so per wing.  These can be as thick or as lengthy as you like, but try to keep even the proportions of these feathers and the feathers from the previous step.  You don't necessarily need to have too many extra lines or spots on your feathers, but the image at the right will show you how if you want those elements.  To create a set, if your character is being viewed from the front rather than the side, simply mirror the drawing you've already done on the other side. And remember, when detailing/coloring, use your imagination!	Draw two thin, slightly curved ovals as shown. Add in faint curves for the feathers. Sketch in thinner, larger feathers. Draw details for the feathers. Outline and color your wing.
Finger picks usually come in a small, medium, or large size. Wearing a finger pick that is too large or small can be uncomfortable and affect the way you play. It’s ideal to go to a music store to try on the finger pick. If that’s not an option, look for a sizing chart online.You should look for picks made for left hands if you are left-handed.; , Some finger picks are as cheap as a dollar, but some can be as expensive as $35. It may seem tempting to go for the expensive one to assure a great sound, but that is not always the case. Cheap picks can often be just as good as expensive finger picks.You may want to pay more if you’d prefer handcrafted metal finger picks.  It’s okay to use metal or plastic picks, but metal picks are ideal if you are going for a specific sound. A metal pick will help you produce a louder and more precise sound. Metal may also be more durable if you play hard and very often., Plastic is softer than metal, so naturally it creates a softer sound with more ease than a metal pick would. Plastic is also a good idea if you plan to make adjustments to your finger pick because they are fairly malleable.It’s also an option to combine plastic and metal fingers since people often wear three picks as they play.  Thinner picks are great for beginner players because they are lighter. This is good for people that aren’t used to having picks on their fingers. They are also good because they are more flexible than thicker picks, and the flexibility makes it easier to play. Thin picks aren’t just for beginners though. They are good for achieving a delicate sound in your music., Thick picks are great for more advanced players that feel confident with controlling their finger picks. They are also ideal for the faster strumming that is common with banjo playing. You can also use thicker picks if you want a heavier sound.	Wear the right size. Look at a variety of picks. Choose metal for a louder sound. Go for plastic if you want a softer sound. Use a thin finger pick at first. Wear a thicker pick for a fast playing style.
Although the synopsis is a very brief snapshot of a much larger work, you still need to take the time to establish the overall premise of the novel and include any essential information the reader would need to understand the story.Imagine someone is reading the synopsis before the book. What information is critical to include? Are there specific details about the setting of the novel or the world you’ve created that a reader would need to understand? Remember, you are trying to draw the reader into the story, so include a few interesting details that help people visualize where and when this is occurring.; , It can be overwhelming trying to decide what to include in a synopsis, but a good rule of thumb is to identify and outline the main conflict in the story.What struggles does the protagonist or main character confront in the book? Are there specific obstacles the characters encounter that you should mention in the synopsis? What will happen if the protagonist fails or stumbles?  , While it can be frustrating to try and condense a novel’s worth of awesome character development into a synopsis, many literary agents report that they want synopses to demonstrate how the main character changes over the course of the novel.Try to keep the main characters from appearing one-dimensional by showing how they react to different situations. Even though you don’t have a lot of space in the synopsis, you can still provide readers with a sense of who the characters are and how they change over the course of the story.  Because the synopsis is designed to be a summary of the book, you will need to outline the plot of your novel and give a sense of the novel’s narrative direction.It can be hard not to get bogged down in details, but a good place to start is by including a brief summary (1 to 2 sentences) of each chapter. Then, try to link and connect these summaries together.You won’t be able to include all plot details, so try to identify the ones that are critical to understanding the book. Ask yourself if the ending would still make sense without that detail. If so, then leave it out of the synopsis., You might be reluctant to spoil the ending, but a synopsis should be clear about the novel’s ending and ultimate resolution.Literary agents want to know how you resolve the conflict in the novel and tie up your story. Don't worry. If your story is published, the synopsis won’t be included on the back of the book and spoil the story for readers.  It’s important for you to review the synopsis, and also ask other people to review the synopsis. The more feedback you seek from others, the clearer you can make your synopsis.   It can be helpful to read your synopsis out loud because you will be better able to notice grammar mistakes and find opportunities to improve the wording. Your brain has to process the information in a different way when you read aloud, and you often notice mistakes and problems you previously overlooked.Ask friends, family members, or colleagues who have not read the book yet or aren’t familiar with what you are working on to read the synopsis. They will be able to provide a more objective view, and let you know if the synopsis makes sense to them and draws them into the story.  Before you submit your synopsis, make sure it provides an answer to the following critical questions:Who is the central character in the book? What are they looking for, searching for, or trying to achieve? Who or what makes their search, quest, or journey difficult? What ends up happening?  , Many writers report that synopses are among the most difficult pieces to write because they are trying to distill an entire book’s worth of material into a few paragraphs. Fortunately, however, the more often you practice writing synopses, the better you will be at this exercise.To get practice writing synopses, try working on one for a classic book or try writing a synopsis of a book you just read. Sometimes it is easier to start out practicing on a book that you haven’t spent hours, days, or years preparing.	Establish the premise. Emphasize the conflict in the novel. Show character development. Outline the plot. Be clear about the book’s ending. Review your synopsis. Make sure your synopsis answers the important questions. Keep practicing.
Use a tape measure or a measuring stick to measure the height of the area from ceiling to floor. You should also measure the depth and width of the water heater area.   Take the full height measurement of the entire space from floor to ceiling, not the height of the water heater. The curtain will need to be long enough to extend from the ceiling down to the floor. Measure the distance between the front of the water heater and the wall (depth) and the space the water heater takes up from side to side (width). Add 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) to both dimensions so that the final mounted curtain will not sit against the water heater itself.  You'll need a special curtain rod that can be mounted to the ceiling, and the curtain rod track must suit the dimensions of your water heater area. The curtain you buy must be long enough to hide the entire water heater from sight.   The curtain rod track will need to have one or two bends in it. Make sure that the curtain rod tracks will extend over the width and depth of the water heater. The tracks can be slightly longer than necessary but should not be shorter than the sides of your water heater. If you cannot find a curtain that matches the height of your ceiling within 2 inches (5 cm) or so, pick a curtain that is too long instead of one that is too short. A long curtain can be hemmed if necessary. While the choice is yours to make, a non-sheer, lightweight curtain that complements the rest of your décor is recommended., Use a pencil to lightly mark where on the ceiling each bracket should be placed.Take into account the full length of your curtain tracks. You may need to draw light lines on the ceiling indicating where the tracks will rest before you mark out the brackets. Space the brackets apart evenly along the length of each track. Take a step back after you've made your marks. Look at the marks from a distance to determine if they look even and make any necessary adjustments.  Use an electric power drill to make a hole for each drywall anchor directly over each marked spot.   Drill a hole in the center of each marked bracket location using a drill bit. Make sure that the hole is as deep as the drywall anchor. Push the anchor into the hole until the head lies flush against the ceiling. You may need to use a screwdriver or drill to push the anchors in completely.  Remove the bottom track piece from each ceiling bracket that came with your curtain rod.Slide the track pieces into your curtain track after removing them from the ceiling bracket structure. The spacing of each piece along the track doesn't matter at this point.  Insert screws through the center of your empty ceiling brackets. Use a power drill to fix these screws into the anchors already on your ceiling.   The screws used to attach the ceiling brackets must go through the center of each bracket and into the drywall anchor already mounted in the ceiling.  Use the connector pieces that came with your curtain rod track to connect the individual track rods together.   On a flat working surface, line up the individual track pieces end-to-end. Slide the connector pieces into the tracks and snap in place. Slide the fitted plastic curtain gliders onto the track one at a time. If the curtain rod did not come with plastic gliders, you will need to buy some separately from a hardware store. Attach the end pieces to both ends of your connected track. Secure them in place using a small Allen wrench.  Re-insert each track piece into the ceiling brackets previously mounted on the ceiling. Use a small Allen wrench to tighten the entire fixture.   Space apart the track pieces of the bracket structure so that they line up with the brackets on your ceiling. You may need some assistance with this step. One person should hold the track in place so that the bracket pieces on the ceiling and on the track align. The second person should slip the two pieces together and tighten them with an Allen wrench.  Attach hooks to your curtain, spacing them apart evenly along the top edge.   The clip part of each hook should be attached to the curtain and the hook part should extend out. The number of hooks you use should match the number of plastic gliders inserted into the curtain rod track.  Slip each hook into one of the plastic gliders currently sitting inside the track.   If the curtain has a definite front and back, make sure that the front of the curtain faces outward as you slip the hooks into the gliders.  Pull the curtain so that its hooks slide across the entire curtain rod, completely hiding the water heater in the process.   Once you finish this step, the process is complete.	Measure the space. Buy a ceiling-mounted curtain rod and curtains. Mark where each bracket needs to go. Install drywall anchors in the ceiling. Prepare the ceiling brackets. Attach the brackets to the anchors. Put the tracks together. Attach the track to the ceiling brackets. Clip hooks onto your curtain. Hook the curtain on the rod. Spread the curtain out.
This is the portion of the dance that you will complete standing up before you hit the ground and start stepping and spinning.  You want to be light on your feet and be able to quickly change directions and bounce up and down.  Stay light on your feet while you perform the crossover move. You don't have to use your left leg first, you just need to make sure that you are alternating feet each time you cross over.  When in a resting position, your legs will be parallel and your feet ready to change directions.  Again, be sure to remain on your toes as you do so.  The key is to go with the rhythm of the music as you top rock, so each time you practice, the speed at which you top rock will depend on the beat of the song. Try to follow the rhythm of the baseline or the snare line.  These simple movements complete the toprock.  Once you've gotten the basic footwork down, you can let your hands swing with your body, but don't overdo it. Loosen up your arms and let them follow your feet.          When you step forward, you can allow your arms to swing back behind you, and as you hop back to a resting position, let them swing back to the front of your body. The arm movements are really up to you, so groove to the music and let your body express itself. Practice in a mirror to check that you are not flailing your arms too much.	Practice the toprock. Stand on your tip toes and begin to bounce lightly. Cross your left leg over and in front of your right leg. Hop to uncross your legs back to a a resting position. Cross your right leg over and in front of your left leg. Jump back to the resting position once again. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for as long as you want to top-rock. Incorporate hand motions.
This recipe for air dry clay can be made with ingredients you probably already have around the house. Check your pantry and assemble the following supplies:2 cups baking soda 1 cup cornstarch 1 1/2 cups cold water Food coloring (gel or liquid) Old pot Whisk Bowl; , Use a spoon or a whisk to stir them together until the mixture is completely incorporated.  Whisk it until you no longer see any lumps, and the mixture is completely smooth.  Add a few drops of food coloring to change the dough from white to red, blue, green, orange, or any other color you like. Just a few drops will turn the dough a pastel color. If you want a deeper color, add more food coloring until you're happy with the way it looks.  Stir it constantly as it heats to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  It will begin to bubble, then thicken and form a ball after about five minutes of whisking. When it's difficult to move the whisk through the dough, remove it from heat.  Transfer the hot dough to a bowl. Cover it with a wet dishcloth to keep the atmosphere in the bowl moist, and let it sit until the dough is completely cool.  As you knead, pay attention to the texture. If the dough seems sticky, add more cornstarch to help it thicken. If it's too thick, knead in a teaspoon of water.  Make stars, fake food, dinosaurs, Christmas decorations or flowers. The sky's the limit! When you're finished, set your creations on a tray to dry.          This clay may take 24 to 48 hours to completely dry. When it's dry, you can decorate the object with acrylic paint.	Gather your supplies. Add the baking soda and cornstarch to the pot. Stir in the water. Stir in the food coloring. Heat the dough over medium heat. Whisk the dough until it thickens. Cool the dough. Knead the dough until it's smooth. Mold and dry the dough.
Exercising can raise your focus for 2-3 hours, upping your brainstorming power. It can also boost your mood by raising serotonin levels in the brain, and increase your overall productivity. To keep your mind in top shape, get at least thirty minutes of exercise a day (e.g. walking, running, bicycling), preferably before you sit down to work out ideas. , Make sure to get adequate sleep to reach your full creative and intellectual potential. Lack of sleep can cause loss of focus, lapses in memory, and may contribute to depression. The required amount of sleep for optimal functioning is:9-11 hours a day for children 8.5-9.5 hours a day for teenagers 7-9 hours a day for adults  , Eating a well-balanced, healthy diet is integral to improving brain function. Try to infuse your diet with "smart” foods that aid with cognitive function and improve concentration. These foods include:Fish Whole grains Nuts Dark chocolate Blueberries	Exercise on a regular basis. Maintain a healthy sleep schedule. Eat healthy.
This will help to protect your voice and to improve your vocal range.The length of your warm up routine depends on the type of singing you are practicing. A classical singer who uses the higher octaves of their voice may need more warm up time than a singer of a contemporary genre who is only using a limited vocal range. As well, a belter may need more warm up time than someone who sings soft, gentle children’s songs. The time of day you are singing may also affect your warm up time. Many singers need more time to warm up in the mornings because their voice has not been used for many hours (during sleep). If you have seasonal allergies, you may need to have a longer warm up to remove any excess mucus in your throat and lungs.  This exercise will help to reduce any tension in your mouth or jaw. Loosening up your jaw will also help to loosening up your voice.Place the heels of your hands directly below your cheekbones. Push in and down from the cheeks to your jaw line, massaging your facial muscles. Allow your jaw to open as you move your hands down your face. Repeat this several times.  Lip trills are an exercise where you blow air through your pursed lips, letting out a sound on any given pitch. You can do any scales, intervals, melody patterns, or even whole songs on the lip trill.   To do a lip trill, you need to have an even flow of air, very relaxed lips, and control of your breathing. The air pressure must be constant but not too high.Begin by trying to make an “h” sound during a lip trill. Then, try a “b” sound. If you can’t get your lips to buzz, lift them slightly with your fingers. Think of holding the vowel U inside your mouth to keep your larynx relaxed. But don’t push or strain your vocal chords.  This exercise will relax your tongue and engage your breathing and your voice.Place your tongue behind your upper teeth. Exhale and trill your tongue with an “r” sound. Hold the sound steady and keep your breath connected. Try to vary your pitch up and down the scale while trilling. Avoid straining or pushing your voice beyond what is comfortable for you.  This exercise will allow your vocal folds to stretch and expand.   Start in a low pitch and glide up the scale, making a “me” sound. Don’t push the top or bottom of your range. Instead, try to increase the range every time you do the scales.Reverse and glide down the scale from top to bottom, making an “e” sound. Try to do this exercise on an “oo” sound.  This exercise will improve the sound of your voice and stretch your vocal folds.Pretend you are sucking spaghetti as you inhale. On the exhale, make a “woo” sound. It should sound like a buzz. Hold the buzz steady. Repeat the sound 2-3 times. Use the “woo” sound to go up and down the scales.  Humming is a great way to warm up your voice. It highlights the frontal vibrations in your lips, teeth, and face. Humming is also a good way to cool down your voice at the end of a warm up.Begin with your lips closed and your jaw loose. Breath in and exhale while saying “hum”. Make a nasal sound with “hum” and glide down from a high to a low pitch, as if you are sighing. You should feel tickling vibrations in your lips and nose as you hum.	Warm up your voice before every practice. Release your jaw. Do lip trills. Do tongue trills. Practice two octave scales. Practice the kazoo buzz. Do humming exercises.
This should clue you in to the general location of the squeak. Pay particular attention to the joints and corners of your bed frame, as these are common noisemakers.   If you can’t enlist an aide for this task, you can move across your bed yourself. It will give you less flexibility, on account of your ears needing to stay relatively close to the rest of your body as it moves across the mattress, but this can still provide the necessary information. Lift your mattress and box spring up if you’re unsure where your bed frame’s joints are, or drop to the floor and look at your bed from beneath it. At the very least, many bed frames will have support (and corresponding joints) width-wise along the head and foot of the bed, and length-wise along the middle.; , If crawling across the bed wasn’t sufficiently illuminating, you (or your helper) should go to the foot of your bed, grab hold of the bar or footboard, and gently rock your bed back and forth (pushing toward, and pulling from, the headboard and pillows). If you have help, again listen to your bed’s joints and corners while this is going on.   Not too rough! Any bed will start squeaking if you really go to town on it. Push gently, with a slow rhythm.  If you’re still in the dark, you might have an easier time finding the squeak once you’ve isolated the major components. It’s also possible that the culprit isn’t your bed frame at all, but your mattress.   The mattress and box spring take up a lot of room, but find somewhere you can lay both down flat on the ground, as if they were on your bed. This will allow you to continue to effectively test them.  Repeat the techniques above, now that your bed has been partially disassembled. Gently rock your bed frame, and crawl across your mattress and box spring with a friend listening closely (or vice-versa).   If you locate a prominent squeak in your box spring, this can be efficiently treated by applying WD-40 to the base of the specific, noisy spring.  In the event that you’ve been unable to locate your squeak, you might need to broaden your investigation. The squeak could be coming not from the bed, but from a loose floor board beneath you bed. It could also be caused by unevenness in your floor.   Towels or folded-up sheets under a leg of the bed frame might solve minor floor-height discrepancies, but you should consider moving your bed to a spot in your home with more even flooring, if possible. Keep in mind that it might not be a single squeak you’re dealing with, but two or more. Be thorough in your assessment.  Before you entirely disassemble your bed, try tightening its bolts. This is a relatively simple task. You need only to determine the size of the bolt or screw, obtain an appropriate wrench (if it’s a bolt) or screwdriver (if it’s a screw), and then tighten them.   If you’ve been unable to isolate the squeak, try tightening every fastener on your bed. With older, wooden beds held together by nails, tightening the fasteners (or taking the frame entirely apart) is not really an option. In this case, application of a lubricant to each intersection of support slat and bed frame will go a long way toward silencing the bed. If a bolt continues to back out and loosen itself, it may need to be replaced (with a cost of roughly 50 cents). If the holes that the bolts go through are worn, however, this would indicate it may be time to rework or replace the frame. Keeping the bolts tight will greatly increase the life of a metal frame, because the bolts can't ream out the holes as easily.  To properly lubricate the squeak, you’ll need to be able to coat every component of the joint with wax or grease. With your mattress and box spring off the frame, unscrew the bolt or screw at the problem joint.  Look for potential balance problems, such as an uneven floor or a damaged leg. Some bed frames use hard, plastic wheels at the corners and plastic standouts in the center of the frame; over time, this arrangement may distort the balance of the bed frame if the bed is on a soft surface, such as a carpet.   Removing the center standout from your frame and adding another type of support (e.g., a couple of books and a jar lid) might help.  You’ll want to coat everything in wax or grease: the nut, the screw, the washer, the bolt, the aperture in the frame itself, and any other component that may be a part of your bed. The squeaking is being caused by friction, which you will reduce by lubricating every surface. WD-40 or a similar substance also works, as will any oil, silicon, or lithium based lubricant, though they tend to emit strong odors. Open your windows and air out your room for several hours before sleeping on the bed, to avoid nauseating fumes. Paraffin wax is an excellent choice for lubricating your bed’s joints, and is sold in bar form at many supermarkets. A bar of soap, candle wax, skateboard wax, or surfing wax are items you might have on hand that you could use to grease up these contact points.  For wooden beds which connect through pegs and not bolts, you don't really have anything to tighten. Instead, try sliding corking or furniture pads between the pieces of your bed frame to provide cushioning. You can place it around the pegs as necessary, or get crafty and cut small holes in the pad or corking for the pegs to pass through.  You’ve got to sleep in this thing, right? After you’ve thoroughly lubricated the components of your bed frame, put it back together. Ensure your frame’s fasteners are tight, but don’t force them once they won’t move for you.   If your frame has wheels, turn the middle wheels toward opposite corners of the room.  These should be wedged in each corner, laid out as smoothly as possible, and along each slat or metal bar if you have enough towels (or towel substitutes). These should prevent your box spring from shifting too much within the frame. After you’ve placed them, carefully replace the box spring.   Repeating the tests of part one are recommended at this point.  An object bracing your frame can provide support to a squeaky frame. This can lessen extant squeaks, and prevent your bed frame from loosening as time goes on.   Corking, furniture pads, towels, or multiple other objects can also serve this purpose.  Uneven weight distribution often results in a squeaky sleep experience. Mattress can easily become misaligned, especially if you don’t sleep alone.  Again, balancing the weight distribution on the springs can often make a huge difference. Mattress manufacturers recommend that you periodically rotate the mattress to ensure even wear and tear.   Older mattresses should be flipped as well, though newer mattresses are designed so that flipping unnecessary. If you have a coil or foam mattress, however, flipping it wouldn’t be bad; the only mattress you should absolutely not flip is a pillow-top. Box springs should also be rotated, but should never be flipped.  A piece of plywood is appropriate for this. The added pressure may not remove the squeaking entirely, but will certainly reduce it. You should feel minimal additional firmness when lying on your mattress.   If you found a particularly squeaky spot during your earlier investigation, try placing a hardcover book directly underneath it instead.	Listen to your bed while someone moves slowly across it. Rock your bed, gently. Remove your mattress and box spring. Test the mattress, box spring, and bed frame separately. Consider all possibilities. Tighten the metal fasteners. Take your bed frame apart. Inspect the frame and flooring. Lubricate each component of the joint. Slide cork cushioning between your frame's pieces. Reassemble your bed frame. Layer towels, socks, or old t-shirts between the frame and the box spring. Insert a pillow between your bed frame and the wall. Center your mattress on the bed frame. Rotate the mattress. Place a flat, hard object underneath the mattress.
Do you need the ability to play CDs? Do you want to hook up an MP3 player? The type of media that you wish to play will be crucial in helping you decide the best kind of adaptor to buy., There are several types of accessories and adaptors available to allow you to listen to a more varied media collection.The most popular are:  , This is likely the most universal adaptor since most cars are equipped with FM radios. The transmitter identifies an FM frequency that is not being used (at least near your) and casts music from your device over that frequency. The car radio can then pick up the waves and play the music just like any other radio station.The downside is that they are prone to interference.If you choose to use the FM transmitter, you will have to set your radio to the same station the the adaptor is transmitting rather than plugging it into the radio directly. Though models vary depending on your accessories package, Corollas before 1999 may only have an FM stereo., If you want to avoid the interference of random FM waves but have a very old sound system with only a tape deck, a cassette tape adapter will be your best friend. These adaptors are made to fit into a cassette player on one end and plug into another device at the other end. The music from your device can then be played straight through your tape deck as if it were a cassette.From 1999 to 2009 the base model Corolla was equipped with a cassette deck., Like the cassette adaptor, the CD adaptor is made to go into a CD player and allow you to play non-CD media. This also avoids the interference of FM waves. You will usually have a need for this if your car’s sound system was built after cassettes when out of style and before MP3 players were popular.   In 2009, the base model Corolla was upgraded to a CD player., If you have a place to plug in other media, you only need an auxiliary cord or USB cord that fits your stereo and your media device. These cords became popular when car stereos were not equipped to play media from all devices, but manufacturer’s wanted to provide options to their clientele. It is the most ideal adaptor if your stereo is equipped with an auxiliary (aux) port.Also starting in 2009, the base model Corolla was equipped with an auxiliary audio jack., All of these adaptors are readily available and fairly inexpensive. You can usually find them at any store that with an electronics section.  You will need to plug the cord of the adaptor into your media device, whether it’s a CD player, MP3 player, or other device. Then, insert the adaptor into your radio. Once your media is plugged into your radio, sit back and listen.	Consider your specific needs. Know your adaptor options. Use an FM Transmitter to play music through your FM radio. Use a cassette tape adaptor for a cassette deck. Use a CD adaptor just like a cassette tape adaptor. Use an auxiliary or USB cord to connect any compatible media to your stereo. Purchase the appropriate adaptor. Plug in the adaptor.
If your chain breaks, you can remove the broken link and reattach the chain for a temporary fix. However, the shorter chain won't be able to fit around all of your gears, severely limiting your range. You can purchase new links, however, at any bike shop and many sport retailers    Master Links are made to fit easily onto any bike, anywhere. They are easy to install quickly, too, making them handy to keep in your saddle bag on long trips. They are, by far, the most common links used by home mechanics.  Most links have an arrow on them that needs to point in the direction the chain goes when pedaling. The rest are concave (bending in) on one side, and this side needs to face towards the wheel and the rest of the bike., You'll notice that the master link has a figure-eight shaped space for the pins, instead of the normal rounded pins and pin-holes for the rest of the chain. If the chain is not already unlocked, do it now.   Some master links come as two asymmetrical halves -- a C-shaped piece with both pins and an outside plate. To fix these chains, simply thread the C-shaped pin into the both open holes of the broken chain, then fit the plate on top.  Each of the pins on the two halves of the master link needs to go into one of the ends of the chain. Make sure that the pins go in from opposite sides of the chain as well. You are going to hook the chain back together using the figure-eight hole, and they need to line up.  It's as easy as pushing the pins through the wholes. Note, however, that this connection is currently very loose.   Some mechanics use a tensioner, a simple C-shaped wire that hooks into the grooves of the chain, to hold it taut while linking. While not necessary, a set of hands or a similar tool to keep the chain close together makes life much easier.  You want to force the pins into the other sides of the figure-eight hole to lock them in place. If you don't have a pair of pliers handy, there is one more trick to tighten everything. Flip the bike over so it's upside-down. Holding the back break down, slowly pedal the bike. As the brake holds the wheel, and thus the chain, in place, the pressure of pedaling will pull the other side, tightening your master link., While you can fix the chain in a variety of ways, as noted, a broken chain usually needs a replacement. Beyond breaking, old chains expand as the pins inside wear down. This might not sound like much in theory, but it matters when riding. The chain handles and transfers all of the force from your feet to the wheels, and a loose chain means you're doing a lot more work for a lot less speed.	Add a new link as soon as possible to return your chain to its normal length. Face the master link the right direction. Pinch the links together to unhook the two halves of the master link. Take each half and push it through the whole on opposite ends of the chain. Bring the chain together and link the exposed pins through the figure-eight holes on the opposing links. Use a pair of pliers to push the master link together, clicking the pins into place. Know that, in the end, a broken chain usually means you need a brand new one.
Toilets need to be cleaned every day and the constant liquid will likely impact the durability of the sticker, depending on where it is placed. For stickers placed directly under the seat (showing only when the seat is in the upright position), you'll need to use something that can cope with constant cleaning. A sticker placed on the cistern, wall or somewhere else above the bowl might fare better and not need washing as often. Placement is important for noticing though, so don't shift the sticker where it fails to catch the eye––be prepared to do what will have the most impact! Here are several possible ways for making stickers:   Homemade sticker hack: Make the sticker out of paper, then cover it with clear tape to adhere it to the seat. This won't last long but is very easily updated and replaced as needed. Old fashioned paper and tape: While this may not be truly deemed a sticker, you could use this method of signage around the toilet area. However, as it is clearly not waterproof, don’t place this type of sticker sign near the toilet bowl or faucets. This temporary method can be easily revised and removed whenever you desire. Laminate the sticker: Either use a laminating machine or you can encase your homemade sticker between two sheets of contact paper. This can be another easily updated approach with temporary sticking power. Make an actual sticker, one that either clings or adheres long term: Printer programs and forms exist to enable you to make your own stickers. Or, you could have the sticker printed at a commercial printers after you've done all the design work. Just check that the adhesive can be easily removed once the message has worked its magic––most sticker adhesives can be removed using goo-removing solutions or something like eucalyptus oil but you'll need to be sure the toilet seat surface can handle such solutions.; , The design does need to be attention-grabbing. Eye-catching color is essential, so stick to bright colors, especially red, a color that tends to alert people to pay attention. Whether you use hand drawing, printed text or clipart is up to you, depending on what you're most comfortable with, just as long as the end result is visually attractive. Some design style ideas include:   A visual-only sticker: Draw or use clip art to show the image of a person using the toilet, then putting down the seat, in the style of the airline safety sheets. Or, use the common symbol for a forbidden action, by showing the toilet seat upright inside a red circle with a slash through it. Visual stickers can be helpful for households with young children but since visual depictions attract our attention immediately, they're effective for alerting all householders and guests.       Write a simple message: A simple message stuck on the underside of the upright seat can be very effective when in bold colors.       Direct the message to an actual culprit: Pinpointing the person who always leaves the seat up might work if he or she has a good sense of humor but do be careful with those who might be insulted by this direct approach. So, if you know exactly who keeps leaving the seat up, write, “Colin, put the toilet seat down!” as your message. How can poor Colin resist if the sticker is screaming out his name every time he uses the toilet?       A mixture of text and images: Depending on how creative you are, you might be able to combine both images and text to get across a suitable message. For example, a stop sign image design with a message inserted in the middle can be a very effective sticker. Or, you could use a toilet shape, a little boy peeing (cliched and kitsch but cute), an animal shape, etc. and insert text inside the largest part of the image.  The message can be simple, humorous, visual or written. It all depends on how you think the household members will respond best, whether it be cute, a little crude or simply polite and sweet. Brainstorm some ideas for what you think will have the best impact for the householders you live with. And decide whether it's just the seat you want shut, or the whole seat and lid arrangement––it's just as easy to do both. In case you're stuck for what to write on your sticker, here are some ideas poached from various places:   Put me down! Put the seat down! Adjust the seat before take-off. A closed lid repels flies. This toilet only gets cleaned when the seat's left down. The cat drinks from here when the lid's left up. Toilet germs flush into the air and contaminate your toothbrush. Put down the toilet lid!  , The size will be shaped by where you plan on placing it as much as its design elements. Take exact measurements of the intended location and follow these measurements when creating the design. In terms of placement, things to consider include the washability of the sticker (as explained above), the likelihood of the sticker being seen and the effect on your bathroom décor. Under the seat in the part that sits topmost when the seat is lifted is probably the best location, as it shows when the seat is in the upright position. Under the lid in the middle of the seat hole is another eye-catching location. However, the cistern, wall or a nearby spot might work as well.   It might be overkill but a trail of sticker reminders in your bathroom might work in seriously annoying cases. Think toilet seat, flush button zone, washing hands area and light switch! Think about the reactions of guests and other household members. It might be considered annoying, immature or pushy to see these stickers everywhere.  Depending on the approach you've chosen to creating the sticker, once you've got design, message and size sorted out, proceed with making it. It's a fairly easy process but here are some hints for each type:   Homemade sticker hack: Write or print the message on paper in the required size. Add an image if using. Print (if relevant) and cut to size. Hold in place on the toilet seat and use strips of tape slightly longer than the paper to completely cover the paper lengthways. Old fashioned paper and tape: Draw the design and add text as chosen onto paper. Adhere to the wall or other surface using tape, poster tack or similar. Laminated sticker: Create the sticker on a piece of paper, cut it out and place it on top of one piece of contact paper. Use a glue stick to cover the bottom sheet completely and then gently place the next sheet on top. Smooth to remove any wrinkles. Cut the sticker out and use double sided tape to affix to the toilet, walls, etc. For attaching to the toilet seat, tape is probably the best option. Again, with repeated cleaning this will wear and probably need replacing––make a few at the same time and store the replacements in an easily accessed place. An actual sticker: Follow the instructions of either a computer program for making stickers or ask for the instructions of a commercial establishment printing the stickers for you and follow those. If you're printing a sticker, be absolutely sure that your printer can handle any special materials you might be using.  Clean all surfaces first to ensure the best adhesion. Ensure that the surface is dry before attaching the sticker. Don't draw attention to the sticker after placing it. The message needs to be a wake-up call, a complete surprise that registers in the mind of the culprits. And, of course, after sticking your sticker down, leave the seat down in the desired position before leaving.	Choose the type of sticker. Design the sticker. Choose a suitable message for the sticker. Select an appropriate size for the sticker. Make the sticker. Install the sticker. Finished.
If you're in kid's sizes, you'll want the shinier tap shoes. If you're in adult sizes or if you're in a more advanced class, you'll need leather tap shoes. Unfortunately, these are a lot more expensive than the shiny kid's ones. However, they last longer and make a better sound. Plus, they look a lot more professional.; , What brands have good reviews? What brands have bad? Bloch is a great idea, for instance, because this brand makes more durable and well-working shoes.   Do not choose shoes who secure the metal on the bottom with just one screw. If that one screw comes even the least bit loose, you're in big trouble. Shoot for the ones with three screws, as these are better-suited in case the worst happens.  If you order your shoes online and don't know the exact size you want, then there's a very high chance you're about to waste a lot of money. Remember that your street shoe size may not be the same as your tap shoe size.   Try for a local shoe store, especially a dance store. Try several different shoes, even if you feel that one pair is perfect, because there may be an even more perfect one on a shelf.  The average price of a leather tap shoe is about $75, so don't go for something that's $20 or $30. Don't spend hundreds of dollars on tap shoes, either. Kid's tap shoes are typically $20 to $25, so compare that accordingly as well.  Once you've found the right pair at the right price, hand over the cash and bring home your new pair of tappers. Congratulations!	Calculate your age. Do your research. Get fitted. Compare the prices. Make your purchase.

This will give you a good overview of the process so that you can anticipate what step comes next and what parts you will need next. Remember that while this article gives a good overview of the process of installing a garage door, there may be important steps that are specific to your manufacturer. Always assume that their instructions supersede those provided here.; , Your garage door should come with all the necessary parts included. Be sure you have all the parts listed in the instructions and that you understand where each piece provided should go once installed. Its always a good idea to organize your parts into piles, so you can see exactly what you have (and if anything is missing).   While there is some variation depending on the manufacturer, a garage door should come with panel sections, hinges that connect each section together, rollers that allow the sections to move up and down, track for the rollers to move in, brackets to connect the track to the frame of the garage, and a tension spring to help offset the weight of the door. If any parts are missing do not begin installation. Proceeding without all of the necessary parts could lead to trouble installing your garage door, damage to the door, or even injury due to a poorly installed door.  This includes a hammer, nails, power drill with a screwdriver tip, and screws. You will also need a ladder to reach the parts of the door that are overhead. In fact, it's not a bad idea to have two ladders handy, so that you and your helper can both be on one at the same time.   Have all your tools and manufacturer-provided garage door pieces at arm's length to make installation easier.  If hinges aren't already attached to the top of the first panel, attach them. Slide a roller into the left and right hinges on the panel. Also attach the manufacturer-supplied weather stripping to the first panel's bottom edge.   This is also a good time to pre-drill holes for the hinges on the rest of the sections, as it will be easier to get the sections lined up exactly when on the ground. Once you have the hinges attached to the bottom of each section, lay the panel on the ground next to its adjacent panel. Line up the sections exactly, then pre drill the holes where the two sections will be connected. This will save you the time and frustration of trying to attach the hinges while the sections are up in the opening.  Center the panel with the weather-stripping end on the ground. Make sure you have chosen a garage door that is wide enough to cover the opening but does not extend too far past that opening. Garage doors come in standard sizes, with most basic roll-up single garage doors measuring about 7 feet (2.1 m) tall and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. If your opening differs from this, you may have to order a specialty door.   If you don't have someone to help you for this part, temporarily pin the panel in place by driving nails at an angle partially into each jamb. This will allow the panel to stay put while you continue the installation process. Remember not to nail through the actual door panel, just use the nail to wedge it in place.  Each of these distinct parts should be kept separate for now, as they will be attached in separate steps, but the vertical sections should be connected to each other, if necessary.   The vertical section should be approximately as long as the door opening is tall.  Start with one side and then move to the other. Make sure each track is level and that your panel is still centered in the opening. Screw the track to the door frame with the brackets provided, but don't tighten them all the way. You may need to make several slight adjustments to their position as you add the next panels.  Unlike the first panel, the second panel should not have the outside hinges attached before the panel is put in place.   Install the outside hinges and rollers on the second panel (and subsequent panels) by angling each unattached roller into the track, then sliding the roller with hinge attached into place on the panel and securing it with screws. These holes can be pre-drilled but cannot be attached beforehand or you would not be able to get the roller in the track. Be sure to do this for both sides of the doorway. Don't forget to also pre drill the holes for the hinges connecting the second and the third panels before you install the second panel! It's much easier to do this on the ground than when its up in the door opening.  These screws can be tightened all the way once the panels are lined up exactly.  Be absolutely certain that the lag screws go into sound framing but do not completely tighten any of them yet because you still might need to adjust the tracks.   Remember to keep checking that the track is level and that the panels are lined up correctly. Any misalignment early on can cause problems for the function of the door.  Be sure that the brackets below each panel are attached to the wall. Once again, you still want to have the ability to adjust the brackets but they should be secured enough to hold the panels in place.  Secure the top plates of the vertical track to the wall on each side of the doorway. The lag screws must be driven into sound framing since the garage door will exert a great amount of force every time it goes up or down.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions when connecting the tracks together. It may prove helpful to rest the horizontal track on top of a ladder at this point. Verify that the horizontal track is level. Cut the rear track hanger to the appropriate length needed to support the track and screw the track hanger into sound framing, such as ceiling joist or blocking. Repeat this process with the other piece of horizontal track, making sure that the distance between track is the same as below.  Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. If you intend to use an opener, wait on installing the torque tube. The torque tube and/or spring provides lift assistance for the door and is helpful when you are opening and closing the door manually.   Make sure that if you install a garage door spring, you also install a safety cable to protect from accidents if it breaks. Garage door springs are very strong and could fly across your garage if they come loose, causing damage or possibly injury. If you have a garage door opener to install see: How to Install a Garage Door Opener   , Remember to remove any temporary nails, such as the ones you drove into the jamb at an angle across the first panel. Also make sure all obstacles, particularly ladders, are out of the way so you don't hit them when you try the door for the first time.  Tighten the screws starting at the bottom of the door and working your way up. As you go, check the operation of the door by making sure it moves freely in the track. The door should move easily up and down the track once the screws are all tightened.  Make sure the tracks are aligned and make adjustments to the position of the track as necessary. Be sure to check that all of the rollers are sitting well in the tracks and that they are moving freely. Also check that the door will stay in the up position without holding it up. If you have a problem with this, you may need to adjust the slope of your horizontal track or the garage door spring.	Read all of the manufacturer's instructions. Make an inventory of your parts. Gather all the tools and additional materials you will need for the installation. Prepare the first panel of the door for installation. Place the first panel in the doorway. Assemble the vertical, horizontal, and curved parts of the track per the manufacturer's instructions. Install the vertical track by sliding the rollers on the first panel onto the end of the track and then lowering it into place. Set the second panel on top of the first panel with the help of an assistant. Attach the first panel's hinges to the bottom of the second panel. Secure the track further up the wall, so that it is attached (but still adjustable) to the bottom of the panel just installed. Repeat the steps above when installing the additional panels of your garage door. Check that the door is level and make sure the vertical track is plumb. Install the horizontal and curved tracks. Install the provided torque tube and/or spring if you do not intend to use a garage door opener. Clean up your area. Tighten all of the fasteners once you are satisfied with the alignment of the tracks. Check the alignment of the door and that it is secured properly one final time.
Interrupting can put the breaks on effective conversation. Always allow a few seconds of silence after someone finishes talking before offering your response. This allows you to make sure the speaker is done talking.Do not talk over someone either. No matter how passionately you feel about a subject, do not start talking until the other person has finished.  Unless you are explicitly asked, do not offer advice. Unsolicited advice can make it seem like you're not really listening. You're only hearing what you want, and offering advice in response. If someone just wants to talk, refrain from trying to tell them what to do., Never change the subject before the speaker has gotten their words out. Even if a subject makes you uncomfortable, it's important you let the speaker express themselves.If there's family drama, you may be tempted to hurry the speaker. For example, if they talk about how you talked to your father last week, you may start talking about something you saw on TV that night. Avoid doing this. Part of communicating with your family is talking about difficult subjects at times. You need to allow conversations to flow where they will, even if a topic upsets you.  Never rush the person talking. Do not interject with your interpretation before the speaker is finished just to hurry the speaker along. Never say things like, "Can you get to the point?" This will make it seem like you're not invested in the conversation., Even if you're frustrated or angry with someone, try to cultivate empathy when listening. Try to understand how the person feels and why. It's never a good idea to listen with judgment, as this will reduce your ability to fully communicate. Even if you disagree with someone's actions or opinions, avoid judgment.	Do not interrupt. Refrain from offering advice. Do not change the subject prematurely. Avoid hurrying the speaker. Refrain from judgment.
A typical scene can include dozens of shots, from close-ups on a character's face to extreme long shots showing the entire scene from a great distance. There are also shots during which the camera moves, tracking the movements of a character or zooming in on an object. Each is meant to serve a purpose in telling the story.   Note whether the camera is acting as the eyes of a character or is simply watching the scene being shot. Try to determine why the director choose each shot, and what the effect of each shot is. Pay particular attention to unusual camera shots, such as slow motion, tilted shots or shots where the camera is allowed to shake. For example, a tilted camera shot is often used to suggest that the character represented by the camera is drugged. Think about how the camera shots affect the pace of the scene.	Make a list of every camera shot.
You can use plain 2-hole or 4-hole buttons for this. You can also use coat-style buttons with a loop on the back, or even fabric-covered buttons.  If you are using 2-hole or 4-hole buttons, you do not need to prep them. If you are using a coat-style button, or any other style of button that has a loop on the back, you will need to cut the loop off with a pair of wire cutters.When you are done, use a piece of fine-grit sand paper to smooth away any roughness or jagged edges.  This will create the loop for your earring to hook on to. It needs to be a little bit shorter than the button itself.Alternatively, you can use a small piece of gold or silver wire, and then bent it into a narrow U-shape. Be sure to match the color of your wire to your earring hook. For example, if your earring hook is gold, you should use gold wire.  Make sure that the top part of the paperclip is sticking out over the edge of the button. It does not need to stick out by much—just enough so that you can thread your earring hook through.The best type of glue to use for this would be a thick, industrial-strength or epoxy glue. If you are using a basic 2-hole or 4-hole button, however, super glue may also work.  If you move on too soon, the next step might weaken the paperclip loop, and cause it to break off.  Do not pull the loop apart, as this may distort it.  When slipping the earring hook on, making sure that it is facing the right, otherwise, your earrings will be backwards when you put them on!  , Once you can done this, your earrings are ready to wear!	Get a pair of buttons. Prep the buttons, if needed. Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the top part off of a paperclip. Glue the cut piece to the back of the button. Wait for the glue to dry. Twist open the loop on your earring hook using a pair of pliers. Slip the loop over the paperclip, then twist it back shut. Repeat the process for the other button.
Create a foundation by casting a total of 56 beginning stitches onto one of the knitting needles.   See the “Tips” section of this article for more information about casting on stitches.; , Work one knit stitch across the each cast-on stitch of your foundation.   Check the “Tips” section for information about completing the knit stitch.  Knit one stitch, then bind off five stitches, leaving the last of these stitches on the right needle.   Repeat this procedure until you reach the end of the row.  Use scissors to cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring approximately 8 inches (20 cm). Tightly pull this tail through the remaining loops.   Make sure that this tail extends all the way through all of your remaining stitches before pulling it. As you pull the yarn, the shape of the flower should draw together. As you pull the thread through the last loop on your needle, you'll also tie off the work.  Trim down any yarn tails to a length of 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm). Weave these tails into the stitches using a yarn needle.  Use your fingers to push each petal through its corresponding hole. Do so as needed until all petals face the same direction.   The finished flower will be roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter.	Cast on 56 stitches. Knit across the row. Knit and bind off across the row. Pull it together. Trim the ends. Press it flat.
You'll be working with modeling clay and plaster, so, needless to say, this isn't the cleanest of projects. Lay some newspapers down and let's get started. You'll need:   Plaster of Paris Water Modeling clay Petroleum jelly Small natural objects such as sea shells Paper cups Plastic spoons Newspaper or paper towels  , Use 1 part plaster of Paris to 2 parts water and mix well in a paper cup with a plastic spoon. Let it sit while you work with the clay.  Generally, leaves, shells, branches, or bones work best. Just make sure you have enough clay and plaster to cover it.  This will be what your object rests and forms an impression in. It needs to be kneaded until it can cover the area of your object.  Firmly yet slowly press it into the modeling clay to make an impression. The petroleum jelly prevents it from sticking to the clay, so be generous.   Remove the object carefully to create a mold in the shape of the item you used.  Smooth the plaster to the level of the clay to form a flat surface.   Place your clay and plaster mold on a newspaper, paper towel, or other disposable surface and allow it to harden. You'll need to wait at least overnight, but 2 or 3 days is preferable and safer.  The shape of your object should be recreated in the plaster, details intact.	Clean the area. Combine the plaster of Paris with water. Choose an object for the template of your fossil. Knead the modeling clay until it is soft and pliable. Coat the object with petroleum jelly. Fill the impression left by your object with plaster of Paris. Peel the clay off the hardened plaster to free the fossil.
Position the fife so that it is horizontal and extending out to the right of your face. The six holes for fingers should be out to the right, while the one hole on its own goes near your mouth for blowing.; , Cover the three holes nearest to your mouth with the first three fingers of your left hand. Face the palm of that hand toward you. Cover the other three holes with the first three fingers of your right hand. Face the palm of that hand away from you.Though the index, middle, and ring fingers of each hand will be the only ones covering holes, support the fife with the thumb and pinky fingers of both hands by resting them on the body of the instrument however they are comfortable. If your instrument is not the conventional 6-hole fife, you may have more holes to cover with your other fingers, but you can still use this basic hand placement.  Place your bottom lip against the fife right next to the hole for blowing. Tighten your lips and try to blow across the hole rather than down into it.   To get the right angle for your breath, imagine some of the air from your mouth is hitting the inner wall of the fife, and some is going past the blow hole outside the fife.Try blowing out air as if you are whispering the word “too,” with lips tightened together and air pushed out sharply by your tongue.  Roll the instrument slowly back and forth while blowing to find the right angle to create a sound. Also try changing the angle of your breath and the tightness of your lips to find what makes the best sound.   Practice blowing and holding the fife correctly by doing it in front of a mirror.Don’t worry if it takes a long time to get your fife to make a sound! Keep experimenting with the angle of the fife and your lips until you can get a sound consistently.	Hold the instrument out to your right. Place your hands correctly. Position your mouth for blowing. Practice blowing until you get a sound.
Rather than buying a floral headband, making your own is quick, easy, and inexpensive. For this DIY project, you will need:1/2” thick elastic (can be found at any craft store)  An elastic headband can be used if you already own one   Fake flowers (can be found at any craft store) Hot glue gun (E6000 or super glue can also be used)Scissors; , Wrap the elastic around the top of your head. Once you find the right length, hold the spot with your fingers. Unwrap the elastic from your head and use scissors to cut the elastic at the spot marked by your fingers.         If you already have your own headband, you can skip this step. The headband can be any color you like; both dark- and light-colored headbands look nice.  Use your glue gun (or other type of glue) to dab some glue on one end of your elastic. Bring the other end of the elastic to the dab of glue, and place it on top of the glue.Press the two ends together for about 10 seconds. When the glue is dried, you have your headband.          Be sure that the elastic isn’t twisted when you connect the ends with glue. It will make the flowers twist and be uneven when you glue them on.  Pull the artificial flowers off the stems. You should easily be able to pluck them off the stems. At the bottom of the flower, there will be a small, green stem (used to hold the flowers to the longer stems). Cut off the smaller stem under the flower so the bottoms of the flowers are flat.         You can either leave the flowers whole, as they are, or pull the flowers apart to expose the different layers of petals.  If you leave the flowers as they are (whole), apply glue onto the back of the flower using the hot glue gun.Then place the flower onto the headband and hold it in place for about 10 seconds. If you pulled the flowers apart to expose the layers of petals, it may be easier to place a small dot of glue on the headband, and then stick the petal layer onto the glue.Press and hold the petal layer down for about 10 seconds. Space the flowers out as evenly as you want. Continue to add flowers to the headband until you are satisfied with the headband.          If you are using any glue other than a glue gun, consider first applying glue to the flower, then placing it on the headband.It will create less mess.  If you used a hot glue gun to attach the flowers to your headband, your headband will be completely dry after about 30 minutes. If you used E6000 or super glue, let the headband dry for at least a day so nothing falls off when you try to wear it.	Gather your supplies. Measure the length of your headband. Form your headband. Take apart the flowers. Glue the flowers to your headband. Allow the headband to dry.
You can use a milk carton, a lined muffin tin, or a small Pyrex bowl.; , Tie one end to a wooden skewer or toothpick and rest the skewer across the top of the open mold to keep the wick upright.  Remove the paper cover first; break them by hand, or you can put them into a plastic bag and step on them.  You can choose one of three methods given below to melt the crayons.   Fill the mold with broken pieces of crayon, placing pieces around the wick, and place the mold in an oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (just hot enough to melt the crayons), until the crayons melt together (keep watching it!)       Place the crayon pieces in a small metal bowl, or a clean, opened tin, and place the tin into a pot of boiling water until the crayons melt, then pour the melted crayons into the mold.       Put the crayon pieces into an oven roasting bag, place bag into a heated oven or boiling water until crayons are melted. Then pour the crayon wax into the mold.  Wait about 30 minutes.  If you are using a muffin tin, turn it upside-down and tap the bottom gently.	Find or make a mold. Place a candle wick into the mold, sticking straight up. Break the crayons into pieces. Melt the crayons around the candle wick. Let the crayon-candle cool. Remove the candle from the mold.

Get a large flower planter and drill a hole with a drill and ceramic bit that is large enough to get the power cord through. Use silicon or Sugru to patch the hole once the cord is through. Make sure it is very secure and watertight. Coat the whole inside with a water sealant to protect your pot.  You'll need a 1/2" rubber tube cut to 1' or more taller than your  , You'll need to find another flower planter but this time a bit smaller. It should have an opening about the size of the base of the first, and reach to about 2/3 of the way up the first pot. Use a file to create notches in the lip of the pot and then drill a hole at the center of the bottom large enough to get 1/2" rubber tube through. Put this pot inside the first, upside down, pulling the tubing through the hole as you go.  Place another large pot, using the upside down one as a base. You will also need to drill a tubing hole in this pot. Continue placing pots in this manner until it looks like you have 3 nested pots. Don't forget about the hole for the tubing and the notches on the rim of the 2 upside down pots.  Ta-da! Your garden fountain is done!	Prepare your base. Cut and attach the tube. Insert the next pot. Continue placing pots. Add the water and then turn on your pump.

Sometimes making your room better looking can be as simple as getting rid of that old desk chair or those horrible curtains.; , Figure out what furniture you like and what furniture you despise. Furniture is very expensive so only get rid of something if you can't stand living with it anymore.  Paint makes a huge difference. Try three toning your room by painting two walls a lighter color, two walls a darker color, then leaving your ceiling white. Paint is not too pricey, even if you do get a good kind.  Open the windows if you can and take some breaks every so often to clear your head. Painting can take up to two days sometimes, and really is a lot of work.  Vacuum the whole room. Then really scrub at any stains with you choice of general purpose cleaner. Move your furniture back, and then finish up by vacuuming again. Make sure you get all of the cracks too.  Why move it to the same place? Try mixing it up a little. If you don't like it you can always move it back.  Get all the streaks of your mirrors and windows. Dust anything that needs dusting.  You might go to Target, they have good deals, also, Goodwill and Salvation army have many cool things for a lot less money. Who knows you might find everything you need there.  Make sure that along with the comforter you get some matching sheets (they will come with a pillowcase also), a bed skirt, some matching throw pillows, a matching throw blanket, and some matching pillow cases. When people first walk into a room one of the things they immediately notice is the bed. You want yours to be great looking! You don't have to limit yourself to just one collection either. If there's a throw pillow that goes with another set, but looks just as good with the one you picked out get it! Keep your bed made and stuffed animals off. Your pillows will look much nicer and more mature.  Get a cheap plain curtain pole. Nobody will notice that. Then, get some nice long curtains that just reach your floor. Make sure the match with your other stuff.  There you can find the trash cans, hampers, desk accessories, organizers ext. (There may be other places in the store with these items too, just ask an employee.) Pick out a set that goes well with your room. ,, There you can get some plants for your room. Plants really can liven up any room. They are always a great addition to any space! Just make sure you take care of them as directed. Also, if you want to you can get some pretty knobs for your furniture that you have. , Organize everything and find places for all the stuff you bought. Don't leave it laying around.	Take a good look at your room. Start big. Buy paint. When you start painting lay out a tarp or newspapers and move all of your furniture to the middle of the room to avoid ruining anything. If you have carpet in your room get some Windex, resolve, and a vacuum cleaner. So, your moving you're furniture back?, Now comes more cleaning. After your room is spotless you get to do the fun stuff, like shopping. First up is bedding. If you don't have some already, you need curtains!, Now make your way over the the office section. You also may want to check out the dollar spot and the decorations section for some cool things to go in your room.  , Check out the lighting section if you need some lamps.  , Your next stop is Home Depot. You can also stop by bed, bath and beyond and linens and things for other cool stuff for your room.  , When you get back put away all your stuff.
You want new material available regularly, so that the training materials don't become stale. Also, look for a site that has graduated exercises so that you don't become bored once a level becomes too easy for you. Yes, as hard as it might seem at first, it's a skill that you can learn! There are many just a Google search away.; , There are number of books specifically designed to teach sight reading, and take you through practice exercises methodically—each exercise building on the previous exercise, and adding a little something new each time. Here are couple highly-recommended titles:    Improve your Sight-Reading! Piano, Level 1 from Alfred Music Publishing. There are a total of eight volumes, which take you from beginner to advanced.  Primer Level Sightreading Book from Hal Leonard Publishing. For more advanced readers, there are two additional volumes.  The biggest key to successful sight reading is that you only read and play the music once. You can buy a number of music books, borrow them from the library, or print out piano music from a website. Those will all work, but may result in a haphazard learning process.   Think of it like this: when you learned to read, you started with "See Spot run. Run, Spot, run!" You didn't immediately jump to "O joy, O new vertigo of difference, O my platonic reader-writer racked by a most platonic insomnia..."For the best results, focus on music within your skill range.	Train online with sites that are refreshed often. Purchase a "Method" book. Keep it fresh.
Aphid damage is recognisable by telltale signs of cottony-looking threads around new buds and leaves. Some aphids prefer older growth. Aphids are also known as "plant lice" and they hang around in bunches, making them easy to spot.; , Create an aphid spray using a mild detergent and water, or make a soapy garden spray. You could also try the more garlic and onion version here. Spray every two to three days over a period of a week - you must spray the aphids directly for this to be effective. You can also use garlic spray as an effective aphid controller.   Consider using neem oil mixed with water. Or, add neem oil with OHN (garlic + ginger + molasses). Dilute the ingredients in water and spray directly below the leaves (where aphids hide). Spray repeatedly 3 times per week for a plant with serious aphid damage.  Provided you don't mind quite a bit of patrolling and squishing, you can be very effective at reducing the aphid population by manually squashing them. This is labour intensive and likely you will miss some, but combined with organic sprays, this can be very effective. Wash your hands well with soap after each session, or wear garden gloves.  Plant your favourite roses or other aphid-attracting plants alongside aphid-discouraging plants. Aphids dislike garlic, chives, onions, mint, petunias. Aphids love nasturtiums. Roses grown with garlic plants or chives are much less prone to aphid attacks and both have a beautiful flower of their own during flowering season.  Ladybirds (ladybugs) feast on aphids. You can purchase the larvae in packs online or from specialist nurseries. Follow the release instructions carefully - they should be released right near the food (the aphids) and must never be released in an area that has been sprayed with pesticides.  Depending on how sensitive your plant is and your water usage restrictions, you can blast aphids off the plant with the jet stream of a hose.  Sprinkle flour over the aphids using a sieve or flour sifter. The flour will coat the aphids and they will drop off.  Cut-up banana peels or use dried banana pieces for this. Dig the cut-up peel or dried pieces 2.5–5 centimeter (2.0 in) / 1–2" into the ground around the base of every plant that aphids are attracted to. The aphids will soon be gone.	Spot the aphids. Make Organic Aphid Sprays. Squash them. Companion plant. Release ladybirds. Blast them with the hose. Try flour. Dig banana peel into the ground.
When first getting to know your students, you need to gauge what they already know, so you don't waste time in your sessions. Ask the student what they're good at and what they most enjoy about the subject you're working on. Let him or her speak open-endedly about the subject and show off for you. It will make the student feel smart and validated while letting you figure out what material they've already mastered.; , Students are often quite aware of their weaknesses. They know what types of questions they consistently miss on quizzes, or what parts of class lectures make no sense to them. Let the student explain where they get lost, and make a list of those areas for your own reference.  For example, a student may not be able to bring up a math grade within a month, but three months would be a good goal for grade improvement. Minor goals should be set for the short term: the student will write a 150-word summary of a major source for an upcoming research paper by the end of the session.   Write down the goals on a sheet of paper and have the student keep track of it. Putting them in charge of the "goal tracker" gives them more responsibility for their own improvement.  Create a chart that allows you and your student to assess how well he or she is doing both in your sessions and in class. This chart can include entries for:   Quiz and test grades Overall class grades Achievement of the goals you set up together Your evaluation of the student's effort Your evaluation of the student's understanding of concepts Celebrate improvement in qualitative assessments like grades with a lot of praise! If the student's grades aren't improving, but you see a lot of effort, your chart will help keep him or her from getting discouraged.  Before moving on to new material, you want to make sure your student has mastered the old material. Ask one or two open-ended questions that will allow the student to display their understanding of concepts. If they struggle, you may need to revisit that information before moving on. Also allow the student to raise any questions of his or her own about previous material.  Have your student inform you about projects and essays as soon as they receive their assignments. Break each project down into smaller parts and work through them together slowly, well-ahead of time. Not only will the graded assignment be of a higher quality, but you'll also model for the child how to manage their time effectively.   If teachers give out study guides for exams, gear the content of your tutoring sessions toward the material that will be covered.  Depending on the student’s needs for a given class, you may be working on a paper or project, or you may be going over concepts from class. After reviewing old material, make a verbal plan about what you will achieve together in this session. Make sure to keep your goals manageable:   Today, we're going to work on the organization of this essay. We're just going to take the ideas you already have and put them in the best possible order in an outline. Today, we're going to try to figure out the network of Allied forces in WWII. Next session, we'll work on the Axis countries. Today, we're going to look at all the problems you got wrong on your last math test and try to figure out the right answers. Then, we'll do new problems that test the same concept.  Every session should include exercises you know the student can complete successfully. From there, you can build on the lessons toward more complex exercises that may prove more challenging.   If the student doesn't perform at the level you expected, don't give up! Repeat the exercise until he or she completes it correctly. When they do, heap praise on the student for working through an obstacle.  The breaks should be no longer than 5 minutes. Working for long stretches time might wear them out and make them lose focus. A 5-minute break is just enough time to refresh students without breaking stride in the work you're doing.  If your student seems tired or in a bad mood on a given day, don't be afraid to mix things up a little and lighten the mood. For example, if you're tutoring a student in a foreign language, you might listen to and translate songs instead of going through conjugation exercises. You might watch cartoons in that language and see how much of the plot the student can follow.  Some students work better alone, and will do better if given time to complete activities on their own. Others are more social learners who will learn more if it seems like you're working through the problems with them.   Aural students learn best through verbal explanation, so talk to them about concepts. Verbal students need to talk through concepts on their own, so be willing to sit back and listen. Physical/tactile students need to work with their hands. Bring in 3D models if you're studying anatomy, or clay that they can shape into the different organs of the body. Visual students might need graphic aids like pictures, charts, or educational videos.  Make clear that you expect them to prepare for your next session in the time you're apart. If there's any work that wasn't finished during the session, assign it as homework for the next meeting. If you have a fun activity planned for the next session, give the student something to look forward to., As such, you're as much friend and cheerleader at times as you are instructor. By forming personal connections with students, you can more effectively motivate them to succeed.   Talk about how the subject makes them feel. Students who perform poorly in class may feel ashamed of it. When they improve, they may feel powerful and proud. Comfort them in their down times and celebrate their successes. Share your own experiences of failure and how you overcame them. Find out what their passions are, so you can make the tutoring sessions more interesting. A straightforward equation might seem boring, but a subtraction problem about fighting dinosaurs might perk up a student who loves dinosaurs.  Connect to the student on their own terms. If a student is intensely shy, you can't ignore it! It may be that the student communicates best in the days between sessions, when he or she can email you questions. Sometimes students are reluctant to ask questions in person, even though they have many they need answered.  Your students will pick up on your moods immediately. If you seem tired or low energy, they will mimic your tone. But, if you show up smiling and optimistic for every session, they'll follow your lead and put more effort into the work at hand.  Teachers have many students to oversee at once, and must act as authority figures who pass on knowledge. Tutors work one-on-on, though, and are more like "educated peers" than authority figures. You only have one student to work with at a time, so you don't have to lecture. Let students take charge of learning objectives, and guide them toward their goals.   Ask a lot of questions. You don't want to lecture your students. Instead, ask open-ended questions that force them to come to conclusions on their own, with research you help them conduct.  While you need to keep the student on track to achieve their goals, don't be afraid to give up a little control. If, when studying the Civil War, your student wants to spend a lot of time on an unimportant but dramatic battle, let it happen even if it eats up a whole session. A tutor should let natural curiosity grow rather than trying to smother it. The increased enthusiasm will pay off down the line.  Without their help, you won't know how to focus the content of your sessions in a way that will help your students succeed in school. Talking to parents and teachers is especially important for younger students. While a high schooler might be able to explain course objectives to you, a third grader won't.   Reach out to the parents and teacher(s) and set up a regular schedule for communication. You might speak to the parents every time the student is brought in for a tutoring session. You might agree to email the teacher on the first Monday of each month to get a sense of what's coming down the pipe in the student's classwork.	Pay attention to what they already know. Ask where they’re having trouble. Work together to set up goals.Create a mix of major and minor goals that can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time. Track the student’s progress. Open with questions about material covered in the last session. Help students meet their in-class requirements. Focus each session on a specific goal. Provide opportunities to succeed.While you should be working toward goals, you don't want to discourage your student by setting the bar too high. Give your students breaks. Adapt to student needs.You have goals laid out, but sometimes young people get worn down by their work, just like adults do. Cater your tutoring style to the student’s learning style.Not all children learn in the same way. End each session by looking forward to the next one.The end of a tutoring session doesn't mean the student is "finished" for the week. Build a personal relationship with your students.Your job is to help students perform up to their potential. Learn the student’s communication style. Show up for each session in a good mood. Act as a guide rather than teacher.Teachers and tutors have very different roles. Give students room to fall in love with the material. Communicate clearly with parents and teachers.
These are listed under "Things You'll Need" below.  This jug will provide the “skeleton” of your helmet, so try to determine the size using your own head as the model (or the intended Storm Trooper’s) to ensure a decent fit.   Cut a round circle out of the bottom of the milk jug. This circle will be used as the top of your helmet so make sure it is a perfect circle. If possible, use a pencil and protractor or stencil. Label this part “B.” Cut an opening in the front of the same jug. Hold the milk jug by the handle and hold it so that you're looking at the front of the milk jug. The opening you cut is meant to accommodate the other milk jug; therefore, cut a rather large “C” shape into the front of the jug. Label this part “A.”  ,   Cut the top third of the second jug and put the remainder of the jug aside. Slice the opening off the second jug by creating a round circle on the top. Because the circle you cut from the first milk jug should fit on top, use that as a guide. Discard the remainder. Cut the top in half so that you're left with the front portion of the milk jug without a back. Label this part “C.”  , Turn on the hot glue gun and set at either low or medium. Be careful––if the glue is too hot, it may melt the plastic.   Glue part “C” on top of part “A.” This will serve as the lower and front sides of the helmet. The top of the jug is the helmet “nose.” The top opening on the top of the part “C” should be on top where you will be able to affix part “B.” Glue part “B” into part “C.” Part “B” should fit snugly into the top of part “C.” Hold this piece together until the glue dries. Glue a milk cap on either side of the milk jug opening. Flip the cap upside down and affix the top of the cap to the mask. Make sure the caps are evenly distributed on either side of the jug hole.  At this point you should have a helmet that you could place on your head. Now you can begin to add details so it resembles a real Storm Trooper helmet:   Create eye-holes in the front. It’s important that you see while wearing this mask so put the mask on and have someone draw dots where your eye-holes should be. Make the eye-holes as small as possible since “eyes” were not overly apparent in the real Storm Trooper mask. Punch holes on either side of the back of the mask and thread the piece of elastic string through the holes. The elastic will hold your mask in place. Tie a knot on the outside end of the elastic to hold it in place. If you need to adjust the length, do so while threading the string. Spray paint your helmet completely white. Place the helmet on top of several newspapers, preferably in an outdoor area and spray the entire mask completely white. Allow the mask to dry for several hours or overnight. Add details using the electrical tape and black, white and grey craft paint. This is when the totally white mask transforms into a scary Storm Trooper helmet. Print out a photo of the real thing and follow the details based on the film helmet. Use the black electrical tape to form a band around the forehead area and cut a circle from the tape to seal the milk jug opening. Use the black Sharpie for adding in the more intricate details.  These are listed under "Things You'll Need".; , Cut a circle out of the bottom of the jug, cut the handle of the jug as well. This jug will provide the “skeleton” of your helmet, so try to determine the size using your own head as the model (or the intended Storm Trooper’s) to ensure a decent fit.  Leave about 3 inches (7.6 cm) plastic, this will be use to connect to the second jug to form the half of the helmet.  The most important about what you're cutting with is that it does the job, the brand doesn't matter at all. ,,, You can see the Storm Trooper’s helmet already taking shape. ,,, Make sure you paint them black. If you have some broken or old or very cheap sunglasses hanging around your house you can disassemble it and glue them in the eyes, this would really add realism to your helmet.  Add an old washing machine hose to act as a breathing apparatus use on board flying TIE Fighters. Enjoy and serve the dark side well soldier!	Assemble the items needed to complete the project. Cut the first milk jug into two pieces. Slice the second milk jug by cutting off the top third of the jug with the scissors or an Exacto knife. Assemble the skeleton of your helmet. Add details to your helmet. Assemble the items needed to complete the project. Cut the first milk jug. Cut an opening in the front and back of the same jug. Take the second milk jug and cut off the top third of the jug with the scissors or a small craft knife. Flip it .  , Connect the 2 jugs together as shown in the picture using a masking tape.  , Using a hot glue gun, seal the gaps and permanently fuse the mugs together.  , Let the glue dry. Here’s the fun part: spray paint your helmet white and allow to dry before adding details.  , Using a Star Wars photo or clip as reference, cut some black paper and form the eyes, mouthpiece, etc.  , Drill holes on the eyes so you could see well when you wear the helmet.  , Use some bottle caps and glue them in front near the mouth area. Go crazy by adding recycled parts from all sorts, be creative.
Moss Rose is very easy to root from cuttings. However, you should assume a failure rate of about 2/3, so take about three times more plants than you require (though you may have much better success than this!).   Moss Roses can be grown from cuttings every year. This means that after the first time you plant Moss Roses, you will not have to buy these plants again, you can simply take cuttings from the plants you are already growing.  Take four to five inch sections of healthy growth, strip the lower foliage, and insert about an inch of this cutting into the soil.   Press the soil gently around the cutting to help your Moss Rose cutting grow roots, or ‘root’, more quickly.  If you can, root your cuttings outside, as they grow well with direct sunlight. However, if you do this, don’t forget to water your cuttings regularly until they become established.   Water your cuttings regularly until they take root. Once they are established, however, you can water them less. Wait until the ground around your cuttings feels dry in the top two inches of soil.  You can also get cuttings to grow roots in a glass of water. Once they have grown their roots, move them to the site where you hope to grow them in your garden.	Take more cuttings than you expect to grow. Prepare the cuttings and allow them to take root. Keep the cuttings well watered. Root the cuttings in water if you can’t plant them outside.
Since heat bending laminate is a more difficult process, measure the curve of your counter using step one from the cold bending method. If the radius is three inches or greater, you may be able to bend your laminate without heating it.  For tighter radius curves, the first thing you want to do is ensure that you have the correct laminate for the job. Vertical grade laminate is thinner than standard grade laminate, making it easier to bend without cracking. You may also see thinner grade laminate advertised as post-forming grade, which is also suitable for tighter curves.   Another option if you cannot find vertical grade laminate in the finish you need is to thin your standard grade laminate by hand. Using a belt sander, carefully sand down the application side of the laminate across the area of the strip that you need to bend.Be extremely careful and sand the portion to be bent to a thickness of approximately 0.7mm  , Use a T-square to ensure the the vertical surface on top of which you will apply the laminate is perfectly square with the flat horizontal surface. Use a belt sander to even out any imperfections on the vertical sides.  The exact temperature to which you must heat your laminate depends on the manufacturer and grade; however, the forming temperature will be approximately 170 °C (338 °F).   Heat only the section you need to bend and keep the heat gun moving over that section without focusing on one spot too long. A temperature gun is recommended to verify your heated temperature. In excess of 170 °C (338 °F), your laminate can begin to warp or bubble and your application J-roller can begin to melt.  Wearing heat resistant gloves, quickly apply glue to the application side of the laminate and line it up against the counter.  As with the cold bending method, you want to leave an extra 1/2” to the width of the laminate to trim later. Beginning with one end, attach the laminate firmly to the edge of the counter, and use your J-roller to flatten and tighten it down. Still wearing heat resistant gloves, bend the heated and pliable section of the laminate over the curve slowly, using your J-roller to keep pressure against the strip. Roll the entire strip until it is tightly in place on the counter edge.   Depending on the manufacturer and grade of laminate used, this method can yield curved bends around a radius as small as 5/8”or 9/16”, You should give the laminate a full day to set before trimming the excess width with a router.	Measure the radius of the curve. Purchase the correct grade laminate. Make sure the edge is square. Heat the laminate with a heat gun. Apply laminate glue. Attach the laminate carefully. Trim the excess.
For much of the film, Burton’s Alice wears a blue dress that falls close to ankle-length. In some scenes her blue dress is loosely draped and worn off the shoulder. However, in the court scene she wears a strapless red tea-length dress with white and black sheer overlay.   Adults may own a suitable red cocktail dress. The loosely draped version of the blue dress would be difficult to buy or construct, but could be appropriate as an informal toga-style costume. Vintage stores and thrift shops can be good places to find affordable longer dresses that can be modified to look like Alice's film costume.  In the film, Alice does not wear the iconic white pinafore. However, the overlay on the red dress is something like an apron worn backwards; open at the front, covering the back.   You can make your own reverse pinafore by tying a length of black and white fabric across the back of a red dress, and draping part over one shoulder.  In the film, Alice wears white-tinted stockings but they are sheer and not terribly distinctive. In warm weather, going without stockings would likely be as appropriate as wearing nylons.  Burton’s Alice wears white lace-up boots with a kitten heel and a black toe. These might be quite difficult to find.   Black and white saddle shoes might provide a convincing alternative. Some websites that feature vintage imitation clothing, such as Modcloth, stock high heels in black and white that look similar. Purchasing a pair of white boots from a thrift store and painting them with black accents is an affordable alternative.  Alice’s hair is blonde and parted down the center. It falls in loose waves around her shoulders without a headband or other styling.   If your hair is naturally straight, use a curling iron or hot rollers to achieve more body. If your hair is naturally a color or texture that makes imitating the film look impossible, consider wearing a wig to achieve the full effect.	Pick a dress. Decide whether to use a pinafore. Choose your stockings. Find the best footwear. Style your hair.
Operate a roll-around sphere tumbler by placing the compost inside and periodically rolling the sphere around the yard to aerate and mix the compost.   Roll-around spheres are relatively inexpensive but are awkward to roll and the hardest type of tumbler to empty. The more material inside the sphere, the harder it is to tumble the sphere around the yard. An advantage of base-rolling drums and roll-around spheres is that you can roll the tumblers to wherever you want to apply the compost.	Economize with an inexpensive roll-around sphere tumblers shaped like a ball or a round geodesic dome.
If you are widening the doorway for wheelchair access, the width of the doorway should be a minimum of 40 inches (101.6 cm), but 4 feet (1.2 m) is better, if possible.; ,   Insert a chisel or pry bar beneath the outer edges of the jamb or trim. Place a shim between the tool and wall to prevent marring of the drywall. Push down on the tool’s handle to pry the casing or trim away from the wall.    Pick a small block of wood as a template. Place it against the wall near where you will be cutting to widen the doorway and trace around it with a pencil. Cut along the traced lines with a rotary cutting tool. Wear eye protection while using any cutting tool. Take out the drywall piece and insert a small mirror. Look for electrical wires, pipes or other things that you might need to avoid while cutting. ,,   Cut through the nails that secure the doorjamb to the rest of the framing with a reciprocating saw. Cut through the nails at the foot of the studs. Pull the studs from the existing doorway. Use a Japanese saw to cut the baseboard from the floor. Be careful not to mar the floor. Pry the baseboard from the floor using the same technique as you did on the door casing and trim.    Cut 2-by-4-inch boards for the new doorway. Remember to make the top stud short enough to fit between the longer vertical studs. Secure the new stud in place by driving in wood screws at an angle, or nailing them. Install the new header. Insert shorter studs, or cripple studs, between the header and the top of the framing. Secure them in place with screws. ,   Place new doorjamb on the top of the doorway. Stand the new side pieces in place. Slip in shims behind it and nail the side jambs in place. Cut off the ends of the shims that extend beyond the doorway with a saw.    Cut the ends of the casing at a 45-degree angle with a miter saw in the upper corners.    Apply joint compound to the joints with a putty knife. Cut and press paper joint tape into the joint compound. Apply a second coat of joint compound on top of it. Sand the joint compound after it dries. ,,	Measure and draw an outline for the widened doorway on the wall. Pry off the casing as well as any baseboard and chair rail that falls within the area you will be cutting to widen the doorway. Inspect behind the wall before cutting. Turn off the power for the area in which you will be working.  , Cut along the lines you drew for the widened doorway with a rotary cutting tool.  , Pull the framing from the existing doorway. Frame the new doorway. Secure drywall to the studs with drywall screws.  , Install a new doorjamb. Nail the new casing around the doorway with finish nails. Finish the drywall. Replace the baseboard or trim you removed.  , Fill any holes in the wood with wood putty.  , Prime and paint the trim and walls in the color you choose.
This may seem obvious but there is a reason this is effective. Think about how many times you have seen a flyer on a telephone pole or bulletin board. You notice them, because they stand out. So, create a simple but distinct looking flyer that states when you and your band will perform. You can put a flyer in your local café, for example. This is a great way to get noticed.Throw a link to your Twitter handle or Facebook profile on the flyer. This shows that you have a digital presence as well as a physical one.; , This won’t be easy, but it is doable. To succeed at this, you should contact radio shows that play music in your particular genre. Send links to plenty of radio shows and internet radio shows as well. You might be surprised by the interest!   Send your songs to music podcasts online! There are people who create podcasts every week that cover new music. Use the internet to find these podcasts and send songs to the people who run them. Find a local radio station and see if they want to hear your music. Perhaps your town has a university, see if they have a radio station. Student radio stations exist to play new music. You should see if they will even let you play a gig in the station!, Go to a talent show held at the community center. Play an acoustic set in the park. These are all great ways for people in your community to see and hear your band. For example, playing at a carnival in your community is a great way to get noticed. You can also see if you can play birthday parties or weddings.   If your town has a record store, you might try seeing if you can play a gig there. Go to a record store that you often frequent, and ask the manager if they have had bands play in-store. They will generally be excited to have your band play because you will be bringing people into their store. You will be targeting people who are interested in hearing new music. You might even be able to sell a few copies of your album there., You don’t have to be amazing to dj a party. See if there are any events in your area that need a DJ. Not only will you be able to play music you like, but you can mention that you play in a band as well. You will be able to expose people to new music, and you can even drop in a tune that your band made.  Start sending out press releases to local music zines in your area. At first you might not get a lot of attention, but as time goes on you might find a journalist who wants to speak to you. See if any of your bandmates have friends or relatives who are journalists. When they agree to talk to you, be ready to tell them about any new projects that the band is working on. An interview will allow people to learn more about the band.   You don't need to directly ask a journalist to interview your band. You can simply ask a question like "Are you doing any features on local bands?" If they say yes, you can tell them that you are in a band. They might ask you to be in the feature! Use this opportunity to promote your shows. You want people to know where and when you are going to be playing. Talk about your influences and music that you like. Someone who reads an interview and sees that you like a band that they like will definitely be interested in your music. You should try to spread this interview in any way possible. Make sure that you get a link to it when it appears online. After you get that link, throw it on any social media page you have and your website.  Send out demos to music journals, magazines, and blogs. You should do this no matter how confident you are about the work you have produced. Sure, taste is subjective, and it may seem frightening to have what you worked on judged by someone you have never met. However, even if your work is massively panned, then you still will have name recognition. There is also the chance that whoever gets your record will actually love it. You should try to contact people in your local scene first because they will be more likely to review your album.Send as much music as possible to online venues; blogs are a good place to start. There are hundreds of blogs dedicated to music out there. You should target blogs that focus on your genre of music., Try giving away an album on the internet. If people don’t have to pay for your tunes, then they are more likely to listen to them.Giving your music away allows people to test your band, before they commit to purchasing anything that you have to sell. Set up a Bandcamp page and list your album. You can set the price to zero. If you want to go the analog route, you can try burning forty CDs, decorating them, and laying them around places that people frequent.   You can also post your music on Youtube, Spotify, and SoundCloud.  You, of course, need to decide which venue is best for promoting your band’s content. Facebook is often chosen because of its familiarity and ubiquity. In that case, you should make a page for your band. You can also use Instagram and Twitter as well. Try to get all your band-members to link to this page as much as possible. Maybe your band members have blogs, ask them to write about the band. You want to spread your band’s narrative as much as possible.You might want to go through the route of creating your own website.On the website, you can put your band’s biographical details, place of origin, and genre of music. It does not to need to be flashy, but it should tell people what your band is about.  Record covers of popular songs that you enjoy. People enjoy new interpretations of their favorite songs. You should upload your covers online. Try putting them on Youtube or SoundCloud. When people search for these songs, they will also see your cover versions as well., You’ve probably heard plenty of songs that have been remixed. If you have a friend who knows how to do this, then allow them to remix one of your band’s songs. This is a great way to get more listeners because it shows that you are willing to experiment. You may find a new audience for your music by doing this. Once your song is remixed, ask that friend to post it online., You might know a few different bands that have been signed by small labels in your area. Getting signed to a small label is a great way of shifting the promotional burden, so to speak. A label will do promotional work for some bands on its roster and might incubate others. Independent labels are always on the lookout for interesting new sounds., You should be very careful about how you go about doing this. Make list of about fifteen labels. Order the list from most desired to least desired. After you do this, make sure that start researching your top five or six labels. Don't just bombard them with music. Follow their social media pages and talk to their representatives. You need to build a connection these labels before you start sending them music. Once you have built a connection, you should start sending your music out., This is not as impossible as this sounds. In fact, hundreds of labels have been started because their creators wanted to release their own music. If you create a specific plan of how you plan to do business, then you are already on your way. The next step is obtaining money. You and your band members should save up as much money as you can. After you do this, choose a cheap medium to release your music with. Cassette and compact disc are both relatively inexpensive formats. If you do a release like this, then you will have complete control over your music.	Hang up flyers. Be featured on the radio. Play at a community space. DJ at parties and clubs. Get interviewed. Get reviewed. Release your music for free. Create a web presence.This is not easy, but it can be done. Do a “covers” album. Let people remix you. Talk to small labels. Send music to labels. Create your own label.
You can also move daffodil offsets to a container. Try to choose a deep pot to give their roots plenty of room (at least 8 inches). The pot should have drainage holes.  Bulb compost or regular potting compost will work well for daffodils in pots. Fill the pot so that it is about two-thirds full, and plant the bulbs pointed end upwards. The bulbs should be close but not touching. Cover the bulbs with soil and water the pot.  Move the container to a cool dark spot such as a shed or cellar for a few months rather than bringing it into a warm home. Continue to water it and bring it out into a warmer, lighter place after about three months.   It’s best not to put containers of daffodils in a warm location as this inhibits flowering.  After flowering, top dress your container with a fertilizer such as bone meal (this is pretty stinky so you may not want to keep it in the house!).  Daffodils should survive three years in a container but won’t be as good after the first year. For best results, plant the spent bulbs outside after the foliage dies back and replant your container with fresh bulbs for the following flowering season.  Indoor planted daffodils and those previously planted in containers can be moved to the outside for planting in the ground. The best time to do this is after they flower and when the foliage has died back. This will typically be in the late summer or early autumn.   Follow the steps outlined in Method 1 to transplant your daffodil bulbs.	Plant daffodil bulbs in a deep pot with good drainage. Use bulb compost or regular potting compost. Keep the pot in a cool, dark spot for the first few months. Fertilize potted daffodils with bone meal. Replant fresh bulbs each year. Transplant daffodils from a pot to the ground.
Use a small hand vacuum, or hold the furniture-cleaning nozzle of a standard vacuum cleaner. Walk around your infested plants and suck the pests from the undersides of the leaves and foliage. This method is quick and straightforward, and it can remove whiteflies from all stages of the development cycle – from larvae to mature, plant-munching adults.Vacuuming is most effective as soon as you notice an infestation.           When the vacuum bag is full of whiteflies, trade it out. Seal the vacuum bag inside an airtight plastic bag, then put it into the freezer for at least 24 hours to kill off the insects. Once all of the flies are dead, you can empty the bag into the trash.; , Use garden clippers to trim away as much as you can without killing the plant. You can also pluck infested leaves by hand. Look for white eggs and wingless "crawlers" on the underside of the leaves. Extremely infested leaves may be coated with a sticky or waxy fluid—honeydew—that is produced when the feeding nymphs ingest plant juices.Leaves may also appear pale and wilted.    Only trim as much as is healthy for the plant. If a particularly delicate plant is infested, you should cut away only the most infected leaves. If the plant is hardy, consider paring all the way down to the stem in order to stop the infestation in its tracks.Make sure to properly dispose of the diseased leaves. Burn them or seal them into an airtight bag. If you don't handle the leaves carefully, the whitefly infestation may spread again., The whitefly matures in 4 stages: from eggs, to nymphs, to pupa, to the adult fly.Each method typically only targets certain stages in the fly life cycle. Thus, if a method targets the adult fly, you will need to keep applying that treatment until all of the existing eggs have matured into adults. You will need to be quick and diligent in your treatments to make sure that the newly-formed adults do not lay new eggs.The nymph and adult flies are the only stages that cause physical damage to the host plant. Younger whiteflies will, however, mature into more damaging forms if left unchecked. For the best application timeframe, check the lifespan and stages of your particularly whitefly. Various species—including the Silverleaf, Fig, Greenhouse, and Bandedwing whitefly—each have a different lifespan.  Pay special attention to the undersides of the leaves, where most of the whiteflies live. Be aware that this method only kills the adult insect. Wash every 3 or 4 days to eliminate the new whiteflies as they emerge from pupa. Depending on the type of whitefly, you may need to continue this treatment for several weeks until the infestation is gone.           If you use a highly-concentrated soapy solution, try applying it at the end of the day to avoid burning the foliage.  Various other species of insect love to feed upon the whitefly, and you might be able to rein in the infestation by bringing the right predator into the ecosystem. This predator will depend on the type of whitefly. Consider green lacewings, lady beetles, ladybugs, minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, wasps, and damsel bugs.    Be careful when intentionally introducing any new insect species to your garden. The predators may take care of your whitefly infestation – but you may soon find yourself contending with far too many of the new bug! Research before you act.  You can buy these traps in garden stores, or you can craft them at home. To make your own: coat a sturdy yellow surface (cardboard or wood) with a slow-drying adhesive substance. Glue, honey, motor oil, or petroleum jelly are good choices. Whiteflies are said to be attracted to the color yellow. When they flit to the yellow trap, they land and cannot free themselves from the glue.           If you make your own trap, you may need to reapply the adhesive as it dries out. Glue, for instance, may dry within a matter of minutes or hours. Motor oil or petroleum jelly may be less immediately effective, but might stay sticky for longer. Make sure to remove the traps if you use a spray or a wash, or if you introduce natural predators.  Whiteflies tend to group on the undersides of plant leaves, and your trap will be be more likely to catch the insects if it is near their natural habitat.  Take down the traps once the whitefly population is mostly dead, and you only find a few flies caught each day. The traps also have the potential to kill whitefly predators. Thus, they may not be well-suited to a low-level infestation unless these predators fail to keep the whiteflies in control. If the whitefly population bounces back and returns, then you can feel justified in resetting the traps., French and Mexican marigolds tend to repel whiteflies, as do nasturtiums. Put these companion plants into your garden to keep the pests from returning! Be aware that this is a preventative measure, and not a great solution for existing infestations.Pot marigolds and calendulas are not effective repellents. Make sure to use the right variety! If you aren't sure, visit a nursery and specifically ask about companion plants that repel whiteflies.  In a 32-ounce spray bottle, mix rubbing alcohol with water at a 2:5 ration. Then, add a tablespoon of liquid dish soap. Use the spray bottle to coat the leaves of plants that are at risk for whitefly infestations. If you don't overdo it, the spray shouldn't harm most plants – and it might keep the flies from putting down larvae.           Consider using a natural tree oil spray, such as Neem oil.  Earthworm castings, when added to the fertilizer bed of whitefly-infested plants, have been found to repel the flies within a matter of weeks or months.As an added bonus, these castings are a rich natural fertilizer, and they can greatly stimulate plant growth. Ask for earthworm castings at a local garden store., Spread a layer of aluminum foil or reflective plastic mulch on the ground around susceptible plants. This may make it much harder for adult whiteflies to locate host plants, which in turn can bring make them less likely to successfully lay eggs.This step will require special water considerations. Plants surrounded by plastic mulch will need a drip irrigation system. Do not use mulch in hot weather. Too much mulch may overheat the plants.  On one hand, a commercial pesticide is sometimes an effective way to quickly kill off the pests. The whitefly, however, is notoriously resistant to chemical products. Furthermore, these chemicals are often toxic to other organisms in the immediate ecosystem – including the plants and benign insects in your garden, pets and local wildlife, and even your family. Try to keep pesticides as a last resort.  Indeed, the eggs and pupae are able to resist most common insecticides. If you do use chemicals, be sure to switch them out in several-day rotations to keep your fly population from adapting. Even so, there is a strong chance that the whiteflies will adapt. You may unwittingly create a strain of pesky super-flies!	Vacuum the flies. Remove the severely diseased leaves and branches. Prepare for repeated applications. Wash your plants with a soap solution. Introduce a natural predator. Use a sticky yellow pad. Place the traps close to the leaves. Know when to remove the traps. Repel whiteflies with companion plants. Spray your plants with a soap, water, and rubbing alcohol mixture. Spray earthworm castings at the base of the plant. Cover the ground in a reflective material. Understand the risks and the benefits of using insecticides. Be aware that whiteflies easily build up a resistance to pesticides.
Organic soil is generally made up of natural decayed plant matter, black humus and sterilized manure. It usually does not contain peat, which is a nonrenewable resource. It also should not contain any pesticides or fertilizers. Because of its rich content, organic soil can be reused in gardens or containers each year.  Rather than purchase an organic soil, add necessary nutrients to your existing soil.   Test your soil. Using a shovel or garden spade, dig to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in your soil. Place the soil in a zipper-sealed plastic bag, and bring the bag to a local agricultural laboratory, extension office or garden center for testing. The testing center will provide a report on what nutrients your soil needs to support healthy plant growth. Add organic matter to amend the soil. Use your own resources to create compost for the soil. Save decaying plant waste, leaves, grass clippings and vegetable scraps from the kitchen to create organic matter.	Purchase organic soil. Amend your existing soil.
Art isn’t necessarily about money. But it is a lot easier to devote the time to developing your craft when you don’t have to work a full time job at the same time. Think of the money you earn from art as liberating you to pursue what you love. A career can cascade; as you earn the money to support yourself, you can spend more time developing skill and a reputation as an artist., You should build a portfolio of your own work and then do everything you can so that other people find and purchase it. Today that is normally done online. Post your work on social media and build a website that features your best images.If you want to be old fashioned, find a coffee shop that looks like it needs some extra decoration. Bring your portfolio and show the owner your work. Ask if she would be willing to put it on display and refer interested customers to you. She will get a better the ambience out of the deal and you will get to advertise your work.  Subscribe to local art papers and be aware of art shows, festivals, or seminars. When you attend events, be yourself and be sociable. Try to meet people who could connect you to clients or galleries where you can sell you work.   Perfect an elevator speech. The principle of the elevator speech is that you can give it to someone on a short elevator ride and by the end they be interested in exchanging information with you. In a few sentences you should be able to tell someone what makes your work interesting. If it doesn’t seem to work, keep on revising it until you find something that grabs people. Bring a lot of business cards so that when you meet people who are interested in you work, you can easily share your contact information. Include a website that features your work on the business card. Keep track of all of the business cards you receive and set up appointments to meet with people after the event., Become known in your art community as a supportive person with a genuine interest in the progress of your fellow artists. When you make comments, be constructive, not destructive. Help people to learn through guidance and constructive feedback. Use this community to get feedback on your work and meet potential clients.Don’t be jealous of other people. If you develop a reputation of helping out other artists, they, in turn, will help you.Consider forming a collective to pool your resources. You can rent out a space to display your art or even share the expenses of a studio collectively. In the end, you won’t just be saving money, you’ll be introducing one another to new customers., Ultimately, most artists don’t make ends meet by doing just one thing. They have multiple sources of revenue so that when one disappears, backup jobs are still on the table. Sell works online, put others in galleries, look for public art contracts, apply for grants, and teach. Not only is this a good way to make ends meet, you’ll also learn about what the most lucrative business models are.	Consider the value of a career. Advertise. Network. Join a community of artists. Hustle.
The best way to ensure you're impersonation is on-point is to watch it happen. Jim Carry famously spent hours in front of the mirror working on his celebrity impressions, and the work clearly paid off. Even if you aren't doing as much physical comedy as Mr. Carry, working in a mirror lets you make minute adjustments on the fly, seeing little things that you can't notice otherwise. The longer you practice in front of a mirror the better you'll get.   Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and then jump right into the impression as soon as you open your eyes. Practicing this "on the dime" switch will be key for a live audience., Take a few phrases and work on them first instead of trying to pull the accent out of thin air. Just try to perfectly replicate a few phrases exactly how your subject says them. Once you get these down you can start working on a more general accent, as your mouth and mind will be more comfortable with the impersonation.   Can you find other people or actors doing the same impression? This is often a good way to practice, as they will naturally exaggerate important areas to help you hone in on the impression. Make a note of syllables that give you trouble, and try to find an example of your subject saying them. Keep practicing the voice to get better and better. How long can you stay in the accent without breaking?  , A good impression doesn't have to be on-the-nose, especially if the impression is subtle or not particularly unique. A good example of this is Kate McKinnon's recent Hillary Clinton impersonation. Mrs. Clinton does not have a particularly unique voice, accent, or set of mannerisms, but McKinnon pushes harder on her costume, facial tics, and flat tone of voice to make something that is not quite the "real" Hillary, but is still an instantly recognizable impression.   Be careful about going too far, of course! You want to be recognizable, not a cartoon version of the person.  Tina Fey's famous Sarah Palin impersonation is credited with the line "I can see Russia from my house," but it's not something Palin ever actually said.SNL's Bobby Moynihan made "Full Throttle" the Guy Fieri slogan he's never actually said. A recent Melania Trump impression on The Late Show introduced a steely, 5-10 second gaze at the audience that, while influenced by Mrs. Trump, is still a new spin on the "character." If you want to really push your impressions for the audience, you'll paradoxically have to make some things up on the fly.   Remember that if you're performing this for an audience, the impression itself isn't a joke. You'll need to actually do something with it to make people laugh or clap. A classic, easy joke premise is to put your impersonation in a situation it would never actually be in, like a Barack Obama impersonation where he he has to order his own meal at McDonald's.  A good impersonation is fluid, meaning you can react and respond to the conversation without dropping the impersonation. While common phrases and words can help people recognize the character quickly, you'll need to be comfortable on the fly to truly impersonate someone. This takes practice, as well as a commitment to the part. The more you can work on the impersonation, especially with a mirror and/or tape recorder, the better you will get.  Your voice can only change so much. If you have a deep, bass-filled voice, then you will struggle with a high-pitched impression, and there is little you can do to get around this. You'll feel pretty quickly whether or not your voice can hit the right notes, but don't be discouraged if you can't. There are plenty of impressions in your own range.   Just because an accent or impersonation is hard doesn't mean it is impossible -- this skill takes practice. However, you should feel pretty quickly if the tone or pitch is impossible for you to mimic.	Practice in front of a mirror to get the overall impression perfect. Record yourself practicing to hear the voice how your audience hears it. Push your mannerisms and accent a bit further than reality. Add in your own movements, tics, and ideas as they fit the impression. React to others "in-character" instead of relying on stock phrases and sentences. Understand that not everyone can do every impersonation.
Amtrak, for example, lets you pack a bike in a box for $10, carry folding bikes on as luggage, and even offers several trains with walk-on bike cars. Every company is different, however, so don't just buy a ticket and expect your bike to get on easily. You need to do your homework ahead of time to make sure you can transport your bike effectively.Expect a handling fee for bicycles, especially if they are not boxed up.  This involves removing all the pieces, stripping off the handlebars, wheels, and pedals so that the bike fits in a large box. While you can usually get old boxes for free or cheaply by inquiring at your local bike shop, entrepreneurial packers can potentially fit the bike very large TV or appliance boxes.   If you are uncomfortable with bike mechanics, you may want to get your local shop to break down the bike for you. You can then take the bike to a local shop at your new location to get it back together, for a small fee.  This may be important for ensuring you're not carrying too much on board. Check the train service's website for any weight restrictions. Amtrak, for example, has a 50lb limit. This, however, should be more than enough for your bike.   If you cannot weigh the bags at home, most Post Offices have a large scale you can use before you leave.  Talk to the staff at the station about where you need to be, protocol, and tagging your bike so you can get it later. For longer trips, or anything requiring that you dismantle your bike and pack it in a box, arrive an hour before departure.  Many bike shops will break down, package, and ship your bike across the country for you at a nominal fee, usually $20-30 plus shipping. Shipping, however, can get expensive. If you want to do it yourself, you should remove the wheels, handlebars, seats, and pedals and pack them into a bike box or large TV box, then ship the package from a post office, UPS, or FedEx.	Check your train's bike policy before booking a ticket. Know that you may need to pack your bike in a box. Weigh all of your checked bags and the bike before you leave home. Show up well ahead of time to get your bike on the train. Consider shipping your bike long distances.

You won’t be able to identify the size of the leak or effectively repair it until you remove all of the road grime, dirt and rust from the pipe around the hole. Use a steel toothed brush to scrub away the grime, being careful not to get any in your eyes.Scrub the pipe all around the leak, including the top side if you can reach it. Make sure to wear eye protection when scrubbing the piping to prevent anything from getting in your eyes.  Sandpaper will remove any last bits of dirt and debris stuck to the pipe while scoring the steel surface to better stick when you apply the patch. Rub 80 or 100 grit sandpaper back and forth along the exhaust pipe around the leak you intend to seal.If you are using exhaust tape, make sure to scrub the top of the pipe as well. Roughing up the surface of the metal will create a stronger bond for the patch.  Acetone will ensure the metal is clean and free of anything that could interfere with the seal created by the exhaust tape or epoxy. Acetone is the primary ingredient in nail polish remover, so you may use nail polish remover for this step if you’d rather not purchase acetone strictly for this project.Be careful not to drip acetone in your eyes or mouth while cleaning the pipe with it. You can purchase acetone in the cleaning chemicals section of many retail stores.  If you are using exhaust repair tape, wrap it all the way around the part of the pipe with the leak. Continue to wrap the tape around the pipe for a few inches to either side of the leak to ensure there is a good seal. Different kinds of exhaust repair tape will require different application methods, so be sure to read the instructions before you get started.Some exhaust repair tape needs to be applied to warm pipes, so you may need to start the vehicle and let it run for a few minutes before applying. You can purchase exhaust repair tape at most auto parts stores.  If you are using an epoxy to seal the leak, mix the two chemicals together using a wooden dowel. It will begin to cure immediately, so apply it directly to the leak as soon as the components are thoroughly mixed. Dab the epoxy onto the leak, then use the wooden dowel to spread it around the area. Make sure to cake the epoxy over the leak and surrounding pipe so it creates a thick film on the whole area.You may also choose to wrap the leak in exhaust repair tape after applying the epoxy. Different types of epoxy have different curing rates, so read the instructions on the package to know how long let the epoxy dry.	Scrub around the hole with a steel toothed brush. Prepare the surface of the pipe with sandpaper. Wipe acetone on the pipe around the leak. Wrap exhaust tape around the leaking portion of the pipe. Apply epoxy to the leak.
This may be a local beach, or one you visit when on vacation. Shells can also be purchased from craft stores and from online sources.; , Be considerate of nature and leave seashells with live creatures in them alone. You can tell a shell is still alive if you turn it over and there is a creature inside it.   Check with your country's laws to ensure you don't collect illegal seashells. For example, in U.S. waters, Queen Conches are illegal to take. They are a protected species due it being vulnerable to overfishing.  In shelling, a live seashell is a shell with animal tissue still attached to it. This is different from a seashell that is alive since the animal tissue in a live shell is dead. A dead shell is a shell with no animal tissue inside it.   Understanding whether a shell is live or dead will affect the way you will choose to clean your shell. For example, live shells will require you to remove the animal tissue inside.  Boiling or cooking a live seashell will loosen up any animal tissues inside the shell and make it easier to remove. You will need a pot and tweezers or some tool like a dental instrument to remove the animal tissue. To clean live shells by boiling:   Place the seashells in a large pot of room temperature water. Cover the shells with about 2 inches (5 cm) of extra water. It's important to use room temperature water and to put the shells in the pot before heating them up because any sudden heat could crack the shells. Bring the water to a boil. Let the water roll for about 5 minutes. If you are boiling more than one shell, add extra boiling time. As well, larger shells might require more boiling time. Take out the shells with tongs and place them gently on a soft surface like a hot towel. Carefully, with your tweezers or any other tool, pull out any animal tissue from inside the shells and dispose of it., This method of cleaning out a live shell can take the longest, but many choose to use this method to prevent the shell from being damaged. Boiling and freezing, as well as pulling out animal tissue by hand, can cause a shell to crack. Burying a live shell, provided you bury it in a safe place, protects it from damage and is a natural way to clean out animal tissues. Ants, bugs, and other insects will feed on the shell and clean it out. To clean live shells by burying them:   Dig a hole in the ground. Make sure the hole is large enough to fit all your shells and also provide plenty of space between each shell. The hole should also be around 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm) deep to prevent unwanted animals from digging up your seashells or people from stepping on top and crushing your shells. Place your shells evenly with space between them in the hole. Cover the shells with dirt. Wait a few months for insects, larvae, worms, and bacteria to remove the tissue inside the shell. The longer you wait, the better the results.Dig up the shells again and check to see if all signs of animal tissue are gone.  Freezing kills any remaining animal tissue inside the shell and makes it easier to remove. To clean a live seashell by freezing:   Place your shells in a Ziplock bag. You may need to use several bags if you have many shells. Add water to the bag until all the shells are covered. Place the bag in the freezer. Let it freeze solid for a few days. Remove it from the freezer and let it thaw completely. Take out the shells and pull out the animal tissue from inside the shells.  The water will dissolve any dirt on your seashells and give you shells that are shiny and clean by the end of the week.Change the water every day or so. Adding fresh water to your seashell soak can result in even cleaner seashells. You can also choose to boil your dead seashells after the week is over to ensure all particles or animal tissue is completely gone from the shells.  Bleach will definitely remove any dirt, impurities, and animal tissue from your seashells. However, some seashell collectors warn that using bleach can destroy the colour of your shells and make them smell like bleach forever. To clean a shell using bleach:   Fill a pot with equal parts water and bleach. It should be full enough to cover all shells. Soak the shells in the solution. You might notice a flaky, leathery covering coming off the shells. This is the periostracum or the organic coating or "skin" of the shell. Once this coating is gone, you can remove the shells from the solution. Additionally, you can use a toothbrush to remove particles from the shells. Rinse your shells thoroughly and allow to dry completely. Rub baby oil or mineral oil on the shells to restore shine.  Toothpaste is a less strong alternative to bleaching your seashells. To clean a dead shell by using toothpaste:   Smear a light coat of toothpaste over one side of the shell at a time. Let the toothpaste-covered shell sit for at least 5 hours, so the toothpaste has time to soak right in. It is fine to leave it overnight to make sure that the toothpaste does its job. Once it has gone tacky and/or hard, depending on the thickness of the layer of toothpaste you applied, get an old toothbrush and a glass of warm water and scrub the shells thoroughly. Make sure you get into all the little cracks and hard-to-see gaps. Make sure that all of the toothpaste has been removed, even if this means rinsing the shells under running water once scrubbed. This will remove the grit and other parts in the toothpaste, remove anything rough or sharp, leaving the surface very smooth with very few flaws.  If you see that barnacles are attached to your shells, use a dental tool, soft toothbrush, or wire brush to remove the barnacles.   This is most effective if the shells have been cleaned previously, either from being soaked in water or bleached.  Allow the shells to dry for at least one full day and then rub oil on the shell.   Mineral oil not only restores the shine of the shell, but helps to preserve the shell. Similarly, you can use WD-40. However, when using this material, be sure to use gloves to handle the shells.  You can use satin-finish polyurethane or coat with clear nail polish. This type of finish preserves the shell's organic look while giving it an extra glossy shine.   Do one side of the shell each day. Allow the shell to dry completely before starting on the other side. Each side can take about a day to dry.	Obtain your shells from your favourite collecting spot. Do not take any shells with sea creatures alive in them. Determine whether a seashell is a live or dead shell. Boil the shells to remove animal tissue. Bury your live shells. Freeze your live seashells. Soak your seashells in water for a week. Use bleach to clean your seashells. Use toothpaste to clean your shell. Remove barnacles from your shells. Rub mineral oil over each shell to give it a deep gleam. Spray the shells.
The seeds are the shining jet part tucked within the strawberry coloured flesh. The entire flesh and seed are held together in brown cases. See the image to understand better.; ,, It is a good idea to keep the seedling pots in a sheltered and warm place.  It will grow quickly once planted in the garden and is hardy.	Collect seeds from the tree after flowering. Plant the seeds into seedling pots, about halfway down into the seed raising mix.  , Water regular. Plant in the garden once it has taken form and appears strong.
Turn the oven on and set the temperature to 200°F (94°C). The warm temperature of the oven will be just enough to let the candle wax melt.  This will not only protect your baking sheet, but it will also make cleaning up quicker and easier; all you have to do is pull the foil off, scrunch it up, and throw it away. Be sure to cover the sides as shown so that no melted wax will drip onto the baking sheet inadvertently when you remove it from the oven (thus flavoring your next batch of cookies in an unfortunate manner).  You will be placing the baking sheet into the oven and letting the wax melt, so be sure to leave enough space between each jar. If you have a lot of jars, or jars with a lot of wax in them, consider putting only a few jars onto the sheet at one time; otherwise, you will risk the melted wax over flowing and spilling onto the bottom of your oven.  After about 15 minutes, the wax should have melted and pooled at the bottom of the baking sheet. Do not leave the oven unattended. Melting wax is very flammable.   Consider leaving a window open. The melting wax will release a lot of fragrant oils. It will make your house smell nice, but it may also give you a headache.  Set the tray down onto a heat resistant surface.  The glass will be hot, so be sure to protect your hands using an oven mitt.  There may be some wax residue inside the jar, especially around the rim, which was touching the melted wax.   If a paper towel does not get the wax out, then try washing the candle jar with soap and water, or wiping it down with a cotton ball soaked in baby oil.  You can now stick a candle wick into the jar and fill it with wax to make a new candle. You can also paint the jar and use it to hold items, such as pens.   Consider melting the old wax down and using the melted wax to make smaller candles or wax melts.	Pre-heat your oven. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the candle jars upside down on the baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the oven and wait for the wax to melt. Pull the baking sheet out of the oven. Take the jars off the baking sheet. Wipe the jars using a paper towel. Reuse the jar.
Keep it in the freezer until you need it for the test. While it might not seem like ice and silver go together, silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any common metal or alloy, though copper is right behind.   This test works well with coins and bars but will be harder to perform on silver jewelry.  Do not take your eyes off of it. The ice will begin to melt immediately, as if it has been placed on something hot, rather than as if it it was placed on something that was just room temperature.	Have some ice on hand. Place your piece of ice directly on the silver.
If you have a name that you like, you might fiddle with the spelling to see if alternate letters will make it more interesting. The band Gotye, pronounced “Go-tee-ay,” is a respelling of the French surname Gaultier.Sometimes this isn’t a good idea, especially if you’re adding an extra letter where it is really unnecessary. You might just risk confusing people and making it difficult to pronounce your name.  While it may be a hot thing to replace an S in your name with a $ or an I with a !, these just add confusion and likely mistakes in spelling your name. Even though Ke$ha and others have done it, you should skip this.   The singer Prince changed his name to a symbol in order to get out of his contract with Warner Bros. in 1993. Since the symbol was unpronounceable, he was called The Artist Formerly Known as Prince. This really only works if you already have a well-established reputation and fan following, and ultimately would make things too complicated anyway. Prince reverted to being called Prince after his contract with Warner Bros. expired., Some stage names may benefit from exoticizing them. This happens frequently for burlesque and pinup performers. Adding words such as “von,” “de,” or “la” can make your name more exotic or exciting., If you have a very unique name, you may find that people have a lot of trouble pronouncing it. Think about actors Quvenzhané Wallis, Saoirse Ronan or Ralph Fiennes. These are difficult names to pronounce and often require pronunciation guides in news articles. Think of alternative spellings of your name that will facilitate people pronouncing it correctly. Once you are well-known, however, you will likely overcome this problem.  Will your name travel well with you if you start performing overseas? Since the internet has enabled fans from all over the world to connect with performers, think about how your name resonates with different cultures around the world.  If you do choose to use alternative spelling or unique formatting of your name, keep it consistent. Do not fluctuate between using an S and a $. Choose one and stick to it.	Consider changing the spelling of your name. Avoid symbols in your name. Add an exotic element. Consider how people will pronounce your name. Consider your international profile. Be consistent with spelling and formatting.
Gooseberry clippings from a nursery can be purchased year round, will likely come potted, and can be planted anytime between autumn and spring. Potted gooseberry plants will often be simpler to plant as they should already have small root systems established.Consult your local plant nursery for special gooseberry clippings, like strains that are disease resistant or strains that are known for larger yields.; , If you are getting your clippings from a wild bush, or your clippings are unpotted, be sure your clippings are from a 2-3 year old bush with 3-5 main branches and a head of at least 4-6 inches. You will need to keep your bare-root clippings cool and moist if not planted immediately, and they will need to be soaked in water for about 4 hours before planting.Wrap the root in a moist paper towel, place the root in a cup or glass, and set in the fridge until you are ready to plant. Consult your local nursery about whether or not you should plant already potted or wild clippings in your climate.  Preparing your plot in advance of planting will include choosing a well ventilated site with adequate moisture and making sure your soil is loose to optimize growth. Take a shovel and loosen the soil to a depth equivalent to the height of the rootball, which is the mass of roots under the stem, and over a wide area to prevent compaction and improve drainage.If you have bare root clippings they will not have a root ball. Instead, loosen the soil around a depth of 3 inches. If your plot becomes waterlogged over the winter, simply loosen the soil again and plant your clippings on a slight mound, approximately 3-4 inches high., Creating a nutrient rich plot is key during preparation as you will not be adding fertilizer during the planting period. Combine your existing soil with organic matter, like compost and fertilizer, during your initial plot preparation. If your original soil is sandy you many need to apply generous amounts of fertilizer.Consult your local plant nursery about your soil type and about acquiring organic matter for plot preparation.  Gooseberries thrive in cooler climates and will often not produce fruit until a frost has passed. Plant your gooseberries early in spring, or as soon as the ground is workable, as gooseberry clippings can survive temperatures as low as 55 degrees. The earlier you plant your gooseberries, the better and more established the plants will be.Although gooseberries will grow in warmer climates, the produces their distinct tart flavor best in cooler climates.  Gooseberry plants should have a 1 inch margin in depth and a margin approximately 3 times the diameter in width when planted. This will encourage growth and allow plenty of room for the initial roots to take hold. Once planted, gently pack the soil to firm the ground around the roots.If your clippings are having difficulty staying vertical try attaching them to a bamboo cane with horizontal wires., Spacing your plants apart will ensure that they have enough room and light to grow and will encourage their root systems to grow wide. Clippings should be spaced approximately 12-15 inches apart and replanted bushes approximately 4-5 feet apart., Scatter 2-4 inches of organic mulch in the form of wood chips, pine needles, or compost immediately after your clippings are planted. Mulch cools the soil, conserves water, and suppresses weeds, which is preferable in shaded plots and essential in sunny plots.If you do not have a compost at home you can purchase mulch at your local plant nursery. Renew your mulch each year after planting.  After planting, prune all clippings down to 4-6 buds above ground. This will encourage new vibrant and initial growth and the development of vigorous new stems, or canes, that will be able to last years.Prune your plant each year in late winter or early spring to encourage new growth and healthy development. Consult pruning guides for instructions on how to prune your gooseberry plant as it becomes more established over the years., Insect and disease infestations are rare and uncommon. If they do present themselves it is unlikely that they will ruin your entire crop. However, they are important to look for in order to keep you gooseberry bush as healthy as possible and to not affect its future fruitings.   The best way to prevent insect infestations and diseases is to keep a healthy plant by selecting good planting soil, adequate amounts of water, plenty of light, and consistently removing dead leaves and branches., Powdery mildew can present itself during hotter months, and is therefore less common in cooler climates. However, you can prevent powdery mildew by making sure your gooseberry bush is planted in a well ventilated area with plenty of light, which will inhibit the distribution of powdery mildew spores.Check with your local nursery about potential pesticides or sprays that can reduce the chances of contracting powdery mildew, or inquire about powdery mildew resistant strains.  Dry and windy conditions are especially likely to cause water shortage in your soil. Even if your soil feels damp the roots of your gooseberry plant may be dry. Set up an irrigation system or set a daily routine of watering your plant to ensure it is receiving the moisture it needs in order to produce the best fruit possible.Keep in mind that even wet and rainy summers rarely give enough moisture to plants. You will almost always need to set-up alternate means of watering., Gooseberries should generally be ready to harvest in early July. Knowing when to harvest Gooseberries depends on their taste and on your intended use for them. If you plan on cooking with Gooseberries try picking them while they a bit unripe and tart. If you’d like to eat them raw keep tasting until the fruit becomes sweeter.	Get potted gooseberry clippings from a nursery. Get bare-root gooseberry clippings from an older gooseberry bush. Prepare your planting plot the autumn before you intend to plant. Use heavy, nutrient-rich, and well drained soil. Plant gooseberries in a cool spring climate. Plant gooseberries in holes deeper and wider than their root systems. Plant each clipping equally spaced apart. Scatter mulch. Prune your clippings. Look for insect and disease symptoms in late spring. Check for powdery mildew in mid-summer. Water during dry-spells. Know when to harvest.
Tie it onto a thin dowel or long matchstick and dangle it down into the glass candle jar.; , Peel off their covers. Break each crayon into four pieces, if they're not already stubs.   Sort into their respective colors.  In each cup, put the four pieces of crayon of the same color. Then, fill up each cup with the candle wax.  Set the time for 2 minutes and 20 seconds. Do the same with the rest of the cups.  It will be very hot and hot wax spilled on skin can burn, so take great care. Stir the mixture with a craft or popsicle stick.  Check that the wick has stayed centered.  Do the same with the other waxes, adding the next layer after the former one has properly set. As you go, each layer will form a beautiful layered effect, creating a rainbow style candle. Once you have added all of the wax and the layers are stuck together, the candle is almost ready.  Discard the leftover wick piece.  The candle can now be used or given as a gift.	Take a wick. Grab the colored crayons, stubs and all. Set up a row of disposable cups. Place the first cup in the microwave. Carefully take out the cup from microwave. Allow the wax to cool down for a little, then pour it into the candle holder. Let the waxes set in the jar. Snip off the wick to a suitable height and remove the stick holding it. Done.
Since this greenhouse is modular and the size is completely up to you, the number and lengths of the necessary pipes will vary to a certain degree. You will need to measure the dimensions that you want and determine the amount of pipe that you need from that. Try to break up the larger structure into 2’ sections. This will give your greenhouse greater stability and strength. Use relatively thin PVC pipe, no more than 1.5” wide. A good size to use would be closer to ¾”. Also, be sure that your joints and PVC pipe are sized so that they will fit together. This should be labeled, but you can test in the hardware store to be sure or you can ask a hardware store employee for help and advice.  You will form the base and the walls together, out of connected sections of pipe. Begin by connecting vertical pipe sections at two foot intervals to horizontal pipe sections with T pipe joints. Form corners in the horizontal bottom section by attaching a T joint to an elbow joint with a very small section of pipe.   When you are done, you should have a horizontal rectangle or square base with posts coming up from the T joints at regular intervals. The corner posts should come from the the last T joint on the long sides, with the elbow joints and short side of the base protruding out from the “wall”.  Next, you will need to connect the wall pipes to the roof pipes and form a roof. It is important that the roof not be flat across, as this will diminish the amount of light which can get through, as well as cause rain and snow to build up on top of your structure.   Form the central roof structure by creating a line of PVC pipe identical to one long side of the base. The pieces should be connected with four-way joints at the same intervals as your wall posts, except for the ends which will be capped in T joints. From the T joints and four-way joints, place short sections of pipe and cap them in 45° joints. Next, place 45° joints at the top of each of your wall posts. After that you will need to measure how much pipe you need to join the 45° joints of the wall to the 45° joints of the central roof structure. Cut this pipe once measured and fit it between each of the 45° joints.  Place the greenhouse on the raised or ground bed that you want to cover. You can attach it to the ground with stakes and ties or to a raised bed with a conduit anchor but be sure to only attach one long side. This will allow you to lift the structure to water and care for your plants.  The final step will be to cover the structure with plastic or cloth, depending on why you need the cover to begin with. If using sheet plastic, use thin clear plastic and cover the whole structure with one large sheet if possible. Whatever material you use, wrap the structure and then secure with tape (duct or packaging). You’re done!	Get PVC pipe and joints. Connect wall pipes. Connect roof pipes. Place on the bed. Cover.
You shouldn’t be able to hear your fridge running all of the time. This indicates the motor is going at full blast trying to keep the fridge cold. If a fridge is running properly, the motor will only run periodically.Note that your fridge’s motor will run more often if the door is frequently opened. For instance, if you’re having a party and people are going in and out of the fridge, the motor will run more frequently.  If you feel excessive heat coming from your fridge, have a appliance repair professional come take a look at it. There are coils on the back of the fridge that release heat regularly, but it shouldn’t be too noticeable unless you’re nearly touching the insulation that covers the coils.If the fridge is emanating heat, it likely needs new coils. Weigh the cost of repairing your fridge against buying a new one. It is often worth buying a newer, more efficient fridge in these cases.  If you notice food going bad more quickly than expected, or that you have to keep turning the fridge’s thermometer down to keep items cool, your fridge has probably become less efficient.Whenever you notice a fridge is not working as well as it used to, have it looked it by a professional. For instance, a freezer that's running too cold is also an issue. Even if it is still working, the fridge may be using more energy than it should, not to mention increasing your energy costs.	Have a pro look at a noisy fridge. Feel the air behind the fridge. Pay attention to the fridge’s temperature.
Insert the outer end of one paper clip over the closed end of a second paper clip. Follow the wire of the first paper clip around until the two paper clips are connected at closed ends. Continue connecting the remainder of your paper clips in this manner until all of them are connected into a long chain. Clip the last and first paper clips together to make the chain into a closed necklace.   You can also use this method to create a paper clip bracelet. Simple use fewer paper clips to create a shorter chain.; , Cut the paper into 1 in. by 1 in. (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) squares. Create as many squares as you have paper clips.   Bright foil wrapping paper works well, but you can also use origami paper, construction paper, magazines, or other decorative paper. Whatever paper you use should be fairly thick, however, to minimize the odds of tears or rips.  Fold the square over the paper clip, gluing the paper together where it overlaps in the back. Continue until all the paper clips have been wrapped.  Coating the necklace makes it more durable by preventing the paper from ripping and the paper clips from becoming unlinked.  Wait at least 30 minutes in between each application before using more. Three to four layers of glue should be plenty to protect the chain.	Link 25 to 30 paper clips together. Use scissors to cut out squares of wrapping paper. Wrap the center of each paper clip with a paper square. Coat the necklace with glue that dries clear. Apply several coatings of glue.
This wrap is ideal for babies that are 5 months and older. Locate the piece of fabric that is closest to your body. This is the side that you will hold your baby. Shift the fabric so that one “X” is on the side of your body instead of crossing over the front., Gently pull one of the baby’s legs through the hole of the shoulder section that is closest to you. Spread the fabric over the baby’s shoulders, back, and bottom, reaching to the hollows of the baby’s knees., Pull both of the baby’s legs through the section with the logo. Pull up the fabric over the baby’s back and bottom. The baby should now be propped up on your hip comfortably.	Shift the fabric “X” to your side. Put the first leg through the shoulder hole closest to you. Pull both legs through the holes.
For the tie dye to work, this sack should be 100% cotton. This will be your stuff sack. It looks pretty boring now, but just wait!; , This is where you will tie dye your stuff sack. Fill squirt bottles with the colors of dye you wish to use and make sure plenty of rubber bands are available.  Pick up the sack and dunk it in the bucket. Wring it out a few times until it is mostly dry. Then, lay it out on the table.  You can roll it up and place several rubber bands along it, almost like stripes on a caterpillar. This will create colorful stripes. You can also twist it up from the middle and wrap rubber bands around the twisted wad, or you can invent your own design. Make sure the rubber bands are good and tight.  Keep in mind that you don't need to cover the whole section with solid color. In fact, the blotchier, the better.  Once it is dry, wash it in the washing machine by itself to ensure that the dye is more or less permanent. Make sure the sack is thoroughly dry before you continue.  The slits should be about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) tall.  This is your "threading needle".  Make sure the thread doesn't come untied!  , Voila! Your sack has a drawstring!  , When you use permanent markers, this will prevent the ink from leaking through.	Purchase a white laundry sack that is large enough to hold two rolled up sleeping bags. Cover a large table with newspaper. Put on some latex gloves and fill a bucket with dipping solution. Section the sack by wrapping rubber bands around it. Squirt dye onto the sack, using a different color for each section. Allow the sack to dry overnight with the rubber bands on. Cut two slits at the top of the sack, where the sack opens. Thread thick yarn or thin rope through a safety pin or paper clip and tie. Insert the "threading needle" into one of the slits and work it around with your fingers. When the rope comes out the other slit, remove the "needle" and tie the two loose ends together with a square knot. Spread the sack out on a table and lay flat newspaper inside it. Using permanent markers, write and draw on the sack to your heart's content.
Here are some tips gleaned from experience.  No one likes to be the guitarist searching the murky stage for his or her dropped pick while the rest of the band is thrashing on. To avoid this, you should have at least three picks on the ready when you begin a song. There are many devices you can buy to store picks on your guitar.  Even though you just changed the strings on your main guitar, try to bring an extra guitar as a back up. Make sure it is in tune and ready to go at a moments notice. The benefits to having a back up ready are countless. Break a string? Grab the back up. Your main guitar going out of tune with one song left? Grab the back up. Using an alternate tuning during the set? Grab the back up tuned to the desired pitch. Electronics in the body of your main guitar kick the bucket? Grab the back up. You get the idea.  An unsecured patch cord is the number 1 way to damage the output of your guitar and your chances of having a good show. Do yourself a favor and secure it.   Take the tip of the patch cord in your right hand and pull it through the space between the strap and your guitar from behind and plug it into the guitar. What you should have now is the patch cord running from behind firmly seated between the butt of the guitar and your strap and then plugged into your guitars output. Leave a small amount of patch cord hanging to prevent pressure on the guitars output. If you are a little puzzled, go and check out pictures of professionals playing their guitar using patch cords. They all use this method.	Realize that most live disasters happen when you are ill prepared for the rigors of a gig. Have plenty of picks. Bring a Back Up Guitar. Secure your patch cord.
The interest rate stated on your investment prospectus or loan agreement is an annual rate. If your car loan, for example, is a 6% loan, you pay 6% interest each year. Compounding once at the end of the year is the easiest calculation for compounding interest.A debt may compound interest annually, monthly or even daily.   The more frequently your debt compounds, the faster you will accumulate interest.  You can look at compound interest from the investor or the debtor’s point of view. Frequent compounding means that the investor’s interest earnings will increase at a faster rate. It also means that the debtor will owe more interest while the debt is outstanding.  For example, a savings account may be compounded annually, while a pay-day loan can be compounded monthly or even weekly.  ; , Assume that you own a $1,000, 6% savings bond issued by the US Treasury. Treasury savings bonds pay out interest each year based on their interest rate and current value.Interest paid in year 1 would be $60 ($1,000 multiplied by 6% = $60).  To calculate interest for year 2, you need to add the original principal amount to all interest earned to date. In this case, the principal for year 2 would be ($1,000 + $60 = $1,060). The value of the bond is now $1,060 and the interest payment will be calculated from this value.    , To see the bigger impact of compound interest, compute interest for later years. As you move from year to year, the principal amount continues to grow.Multiply the year 2 principal amount by the bond’s interest rate. ($1,060 X 6% = $63.60). The interest earned is higher by $3.60 ($63.60 - $60.00). That’s because the principal amount increased from $1,000 to $1,060.  For year 3, the principal amount is ($1,060 + $63.60 = $1,123.60). The interest earned in year 3 is $67.42. That amount is added to the principal balance for the year 4 calculation.  The longer a debt is outstanding, the bigger the impact of compounding interest. Outstanding means that the debt is still owed by the debtor.  Without compounding, the year 2 interest would simply be ($1,000 X 6% = $60). In fact, every year’s interest earned would be $60 if you did earn compound interest. This is known as simple interest.    , It can be handy to visualize compound interest by creating a simple model in excel that shows the growth of your investment. Start by opening a document and labeling the top cell in columns A, B, and C "Year," "Value," and "Interest Earned," respectively.  Enter the years (0-5) in cells A2 to A7.   Enter your principal in cell B2. For example, imagine you are started with $1,000. Input 1000.   In cell B3, type "=B2*1.06" and press enter. This means that your interest is being compounded annually at 6% (0.06). Click on the lower right corner of cell B3 and drag the formula down to cell B7. The numbers will fill in appropriately.   Place a 0 in cell C2. In cell C3, type "=B3-B$2" and press enter. This should give you the difference between the values in cell B3 and B2, which represents the interest earned. Click on the lower right corner of cell C3 and drag the formula down to cell C7. The values will fill themselves in.   Continue this process to replicate the process for as many years as you want to track. You can also easily change values for principal and interest rate by altering the formulas used and cell contents.    , The compound interest formula solves for the future value of the investment after set number of years. The formula itself is as follows: FV=P(1+ic)n∗c{\displaystyle FV=P(1+{\frac {i}{c}})^{n*c}} The variables within the equation are defined as follows:  "FV" is the future value. This is the result of the calculation.  "P" is your principal.  "i" represents the annual interest rate.  "c" represents the compounding frequency (how many times the interest compounds each year).  "n" represents the number of years being measured.    , If interest compounds more often than annually, it is difficult to calculate the formula manually. You can use a compound interest formula for any calculation. To use the formula, you need to gather the following information:Identify the principal of the investment. This is the original amount of your investment. This could be how much you deposited into the account or the original cost of the bond. For example, imagine your principal in an investment account is $5,000.  Locate the interest rate for the debt. The interest rate should be an annual amount, stated as a percentage of the principal. For example, a 3.45% interest rate on the $5,000 principal value.  In the calculation, the interest rate will have to be input as decimal. Convert it by dividing the interest rate by 100. In this example, this would be 3.45%/100 = 0.0345.     You also need to know how often the debt compounds. Typically, interest compounds annually, monthly or daily. For example, imagine that it compounds monthly. This means your compounding frequency ("c") would be input as 12.  Determine the length of time you want to measure. This could be a goal year for growth, like 5 or 10 years, or this maturity of a bond. The maturity date of a bond is the date that the principal amount of the debt is to be repaid. For the example, we use 2 years, so input 2.    , Input your variables in the right places. Check again to make sure that you are inputting them correctly. Specifically, make sure that your interest rate is in decimal form and that you have used the right number for "c" (compounding frequency).  The example investment would be input as follows: FV=$5000(1+0.034512)2∗12{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1+{\frac {0.0345}{12}})^{2*12}}  Compute the exponent portion and the portion of the formula in parenthesis separately. This is a math concept called order of operations. You can learn more about the concept using this link: Apply the Order of Operations.  Simplify the problem by solving for the parts of the equation in parenthesis first, beginning with the fraction.Divide the fraction within parentheses first. The result should be: FV=$5000(1+0.00288)2∗12{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1+0.00288)^{2*12}}  Add the numbers within parentheses. The result should be: FV=$5000(1.00288)2∗12{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1.00288)^{2*12}}  Solve the multiplication within the exponent (the last part above the closing parenthesis). The result should look like this: FV=$5000(1.00288)24{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1.00288)^{24}}  Raise the number within the parentheses to the power of the exponent. This can be done on a calculator by entering the value in parentheses (1.00288 in the example) first, pressing the xy{\displaystyle x^{y}} button, then entering the exponent (24 in this case) and pressing enter. The result in the example is FV=$5000(1.0715){\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1.0715)}  Finally, multiply the principal by the number in parentheses. The result in the example is $5,000*1.0715, or $5,357.50. This is the value of the account at the end of the two years.    , This will give you the amount of interest earned.  Subtract the principal of $5,000 from the future value of $5357.50 to get $5,375.50-$5,000, or $357.50  You will earn $357.50 in interest over the two years.    , Compounding interest accounts can increase even faster if you make regular contributions to them, such as adding a monthly amount to a savings account. The formula is longer than that used to calculate compound interest without regular payments, but follows the same principles. The formula is as follows: FV=P(1+ic)n∗c+R((1+ic)n∗c−1)ic{\displaystyle FV=P(1+{\frac {i}{c}})^{n*c}+{\frac {R((1+{\frac {i}{c}})^{n*c}-1)}{\frac {i}{c}}}}The variables within the equation are also the same as the previous equation, with one addition:  "P" is the principal.  "i" is the annual interest rate.   "c" is the compounding frequency and represents how many times the interest is compounded each year.  "n" is the number of years.   "R" is the amount of the monthly contribution.  To compute the future value of this type of account, you will need the principal (or present value) of the account, the annual interest rate, the compounding frequency, the number of years being measured, and the amount of your monthly contribution. This information should be in your investment agreement.  Be sure to convert the annual interest rate into a decimal. Do this by dividing the rate by 100. For example, using the above 3.45% interest rate, we would divide 3.45 by 100 to get 0.0345.   For compounding frequency, simply use the number of times per year that the interest compounds. This means annually is 1, monthly is 12, and daily is 365 (don't worry about leap years).    , Continuing with the example from above, imagine that you decide to also contribute $100 per month to your account. This account, with a principal value of $5,000, compounds monthly and earns 3.45% annual interest. We will measure the growth of the account over two years.  The completed formula using this information is as follows: FV=$5,000(1+0.034512)2∗12+$100((1+0.034512)2∗12−1)0.034512{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1+{\frac {0.0345}{12}})^{2*12}+{\frac {\$100((1+{\frac {0.0345}{12}})^{2*12}-1)}{\frac {0.0345}{12}}}}   , Again, remember to use the proper order of operations to do so. This means that you start by calculating the values inside of parentheses.  Solve for the fractions with parentheses first. This means dividing "i" by "c" in three places, all for the same result of 0.00288. The equation now looks like this: FV=$5,000(1+0.00288)2∗12+$100((1+0.00288)2∗12−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1+0.00288)^{2*12}+{\frac {\$100((1+0.00288)^{2*12}-1)}{0.00288}}}  Solve the addition within the parentheses. This means adding the 1 to the result from the last part. This gives: FV=$5,000(1.00288)2∗12+$100((1.00288)2∗12−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.00288)^{2*12}+{\frac {\$100((1.00288)^{2*12}-1)}{0.00288}}}  Solve the multiplication within the exponents. This means multiplying the two numbers that are smaller and above the closing parentheses. In the example, this is 2*12 for a result of 24. This gives: FV=$5,000(1.00288)24+$100((1.00288)24−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.00288)^{24}+{\frac {\$100((1.00288)^{24}-1)}{0.00288}}}  Solve the exponents. This means raising the amount within parentheses to the result of the last step. On a calculator, this is done by entering the value in parentheses (1.00288 in the example), pressing the xy{\displaystyle x^{y}} key, and then entering the exponent value (which is 24 here). This gives: FV=$5,000(1.0715)+$100(1.0715−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.0715)+{\frac {\$100(1.0715-1)}{0.00288}}}  Subtract. Subtract the one from the result of the last step in the right part of the equation (here 1.0715 minus 1). This gives: FV=$5,000(1.0715)+$100(0.0715)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.0715)+{\frac {\$100(0.0715)}{0.00288}}}  Multiply. This means multiplying the principal by the number is the first set of parentheses and the monthly contribution by the same number in parentheses. This gives: FV=$5,357.50+$7.150.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,357.50+{\frac {\$7.15}{0.00288}}}  Divide the fraction. This gives FV=$5,357.50+$2,482.64{\displaystyle FV=\$5,357.50+\$2,482.64}  Add. Finally, add the two number to get the future value of the account. This gives $5,357.50 + $2,482.64, or $7,840.14. This is the value of the account after the two years.    , To find the interest earned, you have to subtract the amount of money you put into the account. This means adding the principal, $5,000, to the total value of contributions made, which is 24 contributions (2 years* 12 months/year) times the $100 you put in each month for a total of $2,400. The total is $5,000 plus $2,400, or $7,400. Subtracting $7,400 from the future value of $7,840.14, you get the amount of interest earned, which is $440.14.  To really see the benefit of compound interest, imagine that you continue adding money monthly to the same account for twenty years instead of two. In this case, your future value would be about $45,000, even though you will have only contributed $29,000, meaning that you will have earned $16,000 in interest.	Define annual compounding.

The cool and dark space encourages the plant to grow its roots rather than shoots, which is a better use of energy in the first few weeks.   60 F is the optimum temperature. This is a rather cool room temperature, such as you might get in a cellar or garage. This step is optional but highly recommended. After a month, you can bring the tulip and its vessel out into a bright warm room. You should always make sure the water is topped up.  Make sure the water in your vessel is topped up so the roots remain in water, but don’t let the bulb itself soak.   Unless you home is very hot and dry, you should check once or twice a week. It’s best to keep forcing tulips out of direct sunlight but they will appreciate a bright room out of direct sunlight.  You are advised to keep rotating the vase. Tulips will grow pointing towards the light, such as from the nearest window.   Rotating the vase encourages them to grow straight and even.  Depending on when you want your tulips to be fully flowered, decide when you want to begin the forcing process.   If you start forcing tulips in the fall, they will need around 3 or 4 months to come into flower. However, those that started right in the middle of winter, for example in December, won’t need as long to come to flower; possibly only 2 months. If you want tulips in flower over the holidays for indoor displays, you’ll need to get started no later than October. If you are keen to have tulips for a very specific date, it’s usually wise to try forcing them at intervals. Start in early September and start forcing one bulb each week until the middle of October. This will make it more likely that you’ll have flowers by the holiday season.  Unfortunately, forcing a bulb tends to take a toll on the bulb’s reserve of energy.   Some kinds of bulbs can recover from forcing and go on to flower again, but tulips are less good at this. It’s fairly unlikely a tulip will flower again once forced, and a tulip bulb won’t stand being forced twice. If you are really reluctant to give up on a bulb once its been forced, you can try planting it in an out of the way corner of the garden with some fertilizer. Possibly it may recover after a few years but you’ll get a better display if you buy new bulbs to replace forced ones. Spent forced bulbs can be composted, unless they show signs of disease. In this case, burn them or dispose of them with household waste.	Place your forcing receptacle into a cool, dimly lit place for a month. Keep your tulips hydrated. Keep rotating the vase to ensure even sunlight. Decide when to force your tulips. Understand that you can't force tulips multiple times.
To remove rust and similar corrosion from most coins, try S100 Polishing Soap. You may be surprised at how well this removes rust from coin surfaces. It is also well suited to silver coins, and it is used by German silversmiths to clean silver jewelry. Silver cleaning wadding or batting products are sometimes helpful since these wool or cotton fibers help clean uneven surfaces on coins. Weiman metal polish should do the trick, along with many other brands.  Try the automobile section of your local department store to find a variety of metal polishes and cleaners that can also be used to clean metal coins. You can use silver cleaner, copper cleaner, or other metal cleaner – but the results of any product will be most effective if you're using it on the type of metal for which it is advertised.  Again, only if these coins aren't being cleaned for the purposes of coin collecting – such as in a collection of coins with any emphasis on building monetary value. Be sure to follow all of the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations whenever using ultrasonic cleaning devices.	Use a metal-polishing soap. Look for metal cleaners at an auto-parts store. Try using ultrasonic jewelry cleaners.
A cupboard or closet in the basement works nicely. Keep them in an egg carton or other container to support them and check back each day to look for eyes.  Keep the potatoes in this location, with the majority of the eyes facing upward, until short, dark green shoots form.  The more eyes you have, the more spuds you can grow; however, the more potatoes you grow off one tuber, the smaller the potatoes will be. Select the three strongest eyes and rub the rest off with your finger or dig them out with a sharp knife.  If you do not want to trim the eyes off the potato, cut the potato in half and treat the halves as two separate seeds. Each half should weigh between 1.5 and 2 ounces, and each should also have two or three eyes on it.   Allow the cut halves to callous over. The exposed portions should dry out and callous over if you set them out for a few days to dry.	Leave your seed potatoes in a cool, dark place. Move your potatoes to a light yet cool location once a few eyes have developed. Trim off excess eyes. Cut the potatoes in half.
Many airlines will allow you to choose your seat when you buy your ticket. Depending on the airline, there may or may not be an extra fee associated with choosing your own seating assignment.If you can’t select your seat online, try calling the airline and speaking to an agent. They might be able to assign a preferred seat for you. Use a site like SeatGuru.com to help you decide which seat to pick when you are booking the flight. That way, you will have seating information specific to the aircraft model on which you’ll be flying.  If your airline allows passengers to select their seats at booking time, the best seats may be grabbed up quickly.

You should try talking to your significant other about your self harm habits face to face, preferably in a quiet, private spot. This may be at your home or the home you share together in a neutral spot, such as the kitchen or the living room. You may also talk to your significant other in a place that you both like to go to together, such as a park near your home or a quiet spot outdoors. Pick a place where both you and your partner will feel comfortable and safe.You may say to your significant other, “Can we talk about my self harm? Let’s go to a private place and talk.”; , Begin the conversation by telling your significant other why you self harm, as best you can. You may not know exactly why or understand the root cause of your behavior. Think about how self harming makes you feel and any possible triggers for your behavior. Use “I” statements when you explain why you self harm to your partner and try to be as honest as you can.People self harm for a variety of reasons, such as trauma like physical or sexual abuse or the death of a loved one. Social issues like bullying and psychological issues like an eating disorder can also lead to self harm. You may or may not identify with these reasons as someone who self harms. For example, you may tell your significant other, “I self harm because it makes me forget my trauma” or “It may seem strange to you, but self harm makes me feel better, even if it's only for a moment.”  , Your significant other will likely have questions about your tendency to self harm. Try to answer their questions as best you can. Being honest with your partner will help them better understand where your behavior is coming from. It will also allow them to feel you can both talk about the issue together.They may have questions like, “Why do you self harm? How long have you been doing it? How does it help? How can I help? Why don’t you just stop?” Use “I” statements and be as honest as you can when answering your significant other’s questions. The conversation may be difficult for both of you so take your time and be patient with each other. If your significant other asks you a question that you can't answer, it's okay to respond, "I don't know." No one has all of the answers, so don't try to force yourself to give one.  Your significant other may be upset when they find out you self harm. They may react with anger or fear, even after you answer their questions about why you self harm. Be calm and patient with your partner. Reassure them that you are aware of the issue and that you appreciate their concern. Tell them that you are being honest with them about your tendency to self harm because you would like their support and understanding.   For example, you may say to your partner, "I know this news may upset you or make you angry, but I need you to try to understand where I am coming from" or "Please don't pull away from me, I need your support more than ever."  , At the end of the conversation, you and your partner should feel more trusting and honest with each other. Make a promise to each other to stay open and keep communication going between the both of you. You may end up having many more of these conversations moving forward, especially if you continue to self harm. Try to work as a team on the issue.   For example, you may tell your significant other, “Moving forward, let’s promise to be honest and open with each other. I want us to be able to talk about my tendency to self harm and how if affects our relationship.”	Find a quiet, private place to talk. Explain why you self harm. Answer any questions your significant other might have. Respond calmly if your partner gets angry or fearful. Stay open and honest with your significant other moving forward.
Make enough to fill a container large enough to fit your entire hand. Choose a container that’s also large enough so that your hand does not come into contact with the container itself.Be sure that the brand of rubber mold you use is non-toxic and safe for human contact.  Hold your thumb and fingers in the pose you wish to replicate. Then dip your entire hand into the mold, keeping it well away from the sides and bottom. Leave at least a half-inch of mold between your hand and the container., Keep your hand posed within the mold for however long your mold’s directions say it needs to set. Then, if needed, wiggle your thumb, fingers, and hand very gently to loosen them. Pull your hand out slowly. Avoid any quick, jerky movements that might disturb the cast you’ve just made., Prepare enough to fill the entire mold. Then pour a small amount (not all) of your plaster into the mold. Manipulate the container so that the plaster coats the insides of the finger- and thumb-holes in your mold. Allow the plaster to settle a bit to avoid the formation of air pockets., Fill the entire mold. Then bang the table a few times to release any air pockets. Quit once you no longer see any bubbles bursting on the surface., Wait for the time indicated by the directions to your plaster. Then upend the container and empty it onto the table. Make cuts into the rubber mold with a plastic knife and peel it from the plaster cast, piece by piece., Look for any imperfections where empty space in the rubber mold may have allowed room for extra plaster. Remove gently with sand paper or a small knife or file. Then either leave your finished cast as is or paint it as you desire.	Mix a batch of rubber mold. Soak your hand in warm water. Allow the mold to set. Mix a batch of plaster. Pour the rest of your plaster. Allow the plaster set. Clean the plaster cast.
Stuffing only needs to be done when you’re weathering an object that may lose shape, such as a shoe or bag. Fill the item completely with old newspaper. Lay other leather objects flat on a table., Get some rubbing alcohol from the self-care section at a drugstore or general store. Load the alcohol into a spray bottle and lightly coat the leather. The leather should be damp, not soaked.If you don’t have a spray bottle, use an old toothbrush to spread the rubbing alcohol. Acetone also works. It may help remove dye, but acetone can be dangerous and you may need a lot of it., Use the brush on the areas you wish to weather. To get the most authentic look, give extra attention to exposed areas like seams, edges, elbows on jackets, straps on bags, and heels on shoes. Do this while the leather is damp with rubbing alcohol to speed up aging.Any abrasive object, such as pumice stones or sandpaper, can be used. Sandpaper is very abrasive, so use it as a last resort.  Once the rubbing alcohol is dry, apply shoe wax to give the leather protection You can use your finger, a cloth, or an old toothbrush to spread the wax over the leather. Work in as much wax as possible and wipe off the excess. Finish by buffing the leather with a brush.	Stuff the leather with newspaper. Spray the leather with rubbing alcohol. Scratch the leather with a wire brush. Seal the weathered surface with shoe wax.
Warm up and stretch. Wear movable clothing (this can mean elastic shorts if you don't have a leotard). Wear dancing shoes of your choice.; , Move furniture and other obstacles aside. Make sure the area is not slippery.  Especially when you first start. It helps you build your confidence rather than when you are being watched.  If no mirror is available, a glass door or large window can provide some feedback, too. It helps to stand on the more brightly lit side.  Something upbeat with plenty of drama and variety is a good place to start. Try many different songs and styles to find what works for you.  As you warm up, vary your steps and start to move your upper body any way that seems to go with the music.  Arms, hands, legs, and feet are the obvious ones, but don't forget shoulders, knees, head, chest, hips and everything else. Notice what looks good and what feels good. Notice what works with your music.  If you're extending a hand, for instance, follow with your chest and head and use your legs. Unless you intend to keep something motionless, you'll just end up looking stiff.  Think about the shape and posture of your whole body.  Pantomime the words. Get bigger when the music gets louder; get faster when the music gets faster.  Shake, turn, move with the music. Intensity doesn't necessarily mean speed, though. A slow motion can be every bit as intense and deliberate as a quick one.  Dance is an amplification of body language you already know. Does your music call for you to puff up your chest and strut, or shrink sadly away?  , Also watch anybody else moving. Martial artists, figure skaters, actors on a stage, soccer players, and children can all suggest ways to move.  This is your own creation, so there's no reason that elements of belly dancing and ballet can't blend.  Step on a beat when the music is still, subdivide the beat, change direction mid-measure or mid-phrase, and occasionally do something a bit contrary to the mood of the music.	Get comfortable. Find a space large enough to dance. Be alone. Get a mirror.A mirror will help you see how you look. Put on some music. Become familiar with the time and beat just by walking to the music. Experiment with different ways to move. Work up to dancing with your whole body. Try moving slowly between a series of poses, with or without slow music. Move to the music and do the obvious. Put spirit, conviction, and enthusiasm into your dance. Notice moves and ways of moving, whether in other dancers or just in those around you. Watch other dancers for moves and ideas. Take dancing lessons in different styles to learn motions, then mix them together. Try dropping in unexpected elements once you get the hang of it.
You don’t want to be pulling down on the handle bars. If you do that, you’ll essentially be fighting against the bike. If the road is bumpy or has potholes then your handlebars are bound to jerk around a little bit. Allow for these small movements. , Since you won’t be gripping onto the handlebars with your arms really tightly, it’s important to anchor yourself by hugging the motorcycle with your knees. It doesn’t need to be a death grip, just enough to keep you sturdy. You can also hold down on the pegs with the heels of your boot.  If you have to decelerate, downshift, or, worst of all, brake, in the turn then you have entered the turn too quickly. Brake before the turn, consider your entering strategy, and then enter it smoothly. You may want to enter the turn differently depending on the camber of the road and the type of turn, but generally use the delayed apex strategy. This means entering the turn on the outside and then scooting back to the inside as you clear the apex of the turn.	Keep your arms relaxed and parallel to the ground. Anchor yourself to the bike using your knees. Plan your turn.
The type of tree you plan to grow depends on your location and climate. Individuals who live in northern climates will fare best with evergreen, apple or pear trees. In contrast, those who live in warmer locales can grow peaches, plums and even citrus trees. Water accessibility, sun exposure and soil content can also play a big role in determining what type of tree will grow best.; , In most cases, the forest service in your state will oversee your tree farm.   The forest service in your state will provide guidance regarding growing, cutting, and selling your trees and can help in the creation of a management plan. In addition, state forest services can often aid in the certification of a tree farm.  Be aware that it may take several months for the tax exemption to be received after it has been filed.   Not all individuals who manage tree farms will receive a tax exemption. Often, the granting of a tax exemption is based on the size and type of tree farm, as well as the quality of the soil in which the trees are grown.    Trimming, watering and ensuring overall tree maintenance are required year-round. While small farms may be maintained by one individual, larger facilities may require the aid of numerous employees. Make sure that the individuals in charge of tree care are experienced working with the specific variety for best results.	Determine what type of tree you plan to grow. Contact local agencies. File a tax exemption. Manage the tree farm.
Newer styles don't work as well as the Type 1. Type 1 VW Beetles are the models from the 1970s and can commonly be found in Arizona and Texas because VW production was transferred to Mexico during that time.; , These may include a megaphone exhaust, tires, shock absorbers, and springs.   A good source for parts is eBay Motors, as well as dune buggy specialty stores such as AppleTreeAuto.com or Chirco.com.  To avoid serious injury or worse, make sure the vehicle is secure before crawling around underneath it. It's more fun for you to be inside the car, rather than the car being inside you.  Strip it down till it contains only the bare essentials: the frame, engine, suspension, steering wheel, tires, brakes, and some type of seat. Everything else is unnecessary and can be stripped away. Use the leftover parts to make scrap metal sculptures, or sell the parts on eBay.   Remove the fenders, bumpers, and trunk lid. Remember that the trunk of a VW Beetle is in the front and the engine is in the back.       Replace the tires, wheels, suspension, and exhaust. Since your vehicle is older, these components are likely to be in poor shape. Remove the wheels and tires since you will be replacing the tires and reusing the wheels if they still are in decent shape. Make sure to keep the lug nuts from the wheels.       Replace the suspension components, such as the shock absorbers and springs. Obtain taller springs so that your dune buggy will sit higher off the ground.       Remove the exhaust pipe with a reciprocating saw. Make your cut 5 inches (13 cm) from the header flange. Install the megaphone exhaust at a 45-degree angle, thoroughly reading the manufacturer's instructions.       Install your new tires onto the factory wheels, and attach to the VW by tightening the lug nuts. Remove your dune buggy from the jack stand.  If you prefer to modify the engine, the Chevrolet Corvair engine is a popular upgrade choice. This allows you to upgrade to 6 cylinders and creates the possibility of achieving up to 80 horsepower (130 kW).	Acquire a Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle. Acquire your replacement parts. Place your VW on jack stands. Strip down your VW Beetle. Paint the frame, and add any desired extras to your DIY dune buggy.
Being on a reality TV show is about being exposed. And that exposure is to everyone, including your family, friends, neighbors, former school teachers, the boss, your priest, and your old flame. Is this something you can handle? Do you mind if people who used to know you talk about you? (They will, and it won't always be flattering.) If you're not worried about the real likelihood that your laundry will be aired, your worst moments shown in detailed focus, and your inability to do something a monkey could do made into highlight of the week, then you're ready! On the other hand, if you value your privacy and reputation intensely, reality TV stardom may not be for you; give it up before the going gets tough if that's the case!; , It's not reality for starters - it's a house, an island, a boardroom, a viper-infested pit, etc., that has been specifically set up for filming 24/7. On top of that, much of it will be scripted, so the "real you" may not be quite so "real".On most reality TV shows, you'll be expected to live in these fishbowls with very few private moments, with no respite from those you're sharing space with, and with relationship challenges thrown your way daily, relentlessly. And then there are the actual challenges you're expected to perform for the show. Think about the following questions very carefully:   If you're trying for a reality TV show that requires you to "live it rough", is that something your manicured nails and regularly gelled hair-do could handle? Are you all right living with no mattress, or on rationed food? If you're on a show that requires you to take dares or to eat local cuisine, are you able to eat bugs, unusual foods, unidentifiable somethings, or do your vegan or finicky food ways preclude you from sharing in what might be the only protein available that day, or that might win you the challenge?! Can you bear to have to pit your wits against that Harvard graduate every five minutes? Will it bother you to be locked out of a cozy huddle because you're considered to be an outsider at some stage as the game plan in the show unfolds? Can you stand to put your hand into that bee-infested box? (Or are you so allergic to insects that going on a daring challenge show is plain out of the question?) Are you willing to give up your day job or take extended unpaid leave if your employer isn't in agreement with you about having time off work to "play TV games"?, For a brand new show, read whatever is already available in the media about the show's intended themes, content, time slot, and audience. For an existing show, it makes good sense to be up-to-date about the entire show from its previous seasons. This is probably easier if you've watched it without fail since it began. Even with fan knowledge though, you need to take a look at an existing show with brand new eyes and see things that will impact you if you do get a part on the show. Look for such things such as:   How are contestants judged? Who are the likely judges? Would you be able to impress them or simply feel awkward before them? Learn from past successes and failures on the relevant show. Do you think you have the same skills, cunning, daring, or whatever else it takes to avoid the pitfalls and reach success? Is nudity expected at any stage? Do you have to eat things that are simply awful and that you'd never think of eating in a million years? Will you be forced to be around people you know you will find difficult to get along with? Will you have to stretch your physical abilities to their limits, and are you in good enough shape? Your mental health is as important as your physical health too, so think about your health as a whole and the sorts of things that might challenge it on the show.  There are several ways to do this:   Look on your favorite reality TV shows own website. Usually if they are calling for new participants/contestants, the call will be placed on the webpage with further details well in advance of an upcoming season. Keep a watch on the relevant site. Call the TV station and ask for advice. They may be able to take down your details and alert you to upcoming opportunities. Look on a site that collates reality TV show casting calls and auditions. Some examples of sites to check in the U.S. are under "Sources and Citations" below.  The details matter and if you don't abide by the rules in the application form, it may well be thrown away without a second glance, given that so many hopefuls will be trying their luck.If the form asks for a photo, provide one, if it asks for a photo in a certain way, meet that request. If you have to include a video, a portfolio, a reference, etc., do as requested, as this will all increase your prospects of getting to the next stage. If it feels unaffordable or a waste of time, then you're already counting yourself out, so don't proceed.  Whether you are auditioning, or providing a pitch with your application, to catch the eye of those casting, you will need to have something that the reality TV show wants. It may well be that you can't discern this because you don't know what dynamics they are wanting to script into the show (although watching past shows should give you some idea), or whether someone similar to you has already come to their notice and they don't need another person so alike. There are things you can do to improve your chances, however, such as:   Proving your own "wow factor" (appearance, a talent, a stunt, etc.), or approaching the audition or pitch with a unique angle. Think about making use of such tools as YouTube (start a campaign!), a portfolio of your talents outside of the usual humdrum work routine, or zany photos of yourself. Think outside the square, relate it to the TV show in question, and give it your all if you go down the path of trying to impress those selecting the cast in a unique way. Beware of resorting to gimmicks though, as these rarely ingratiate you with those judging your performance. Find the fine balance between interestingly unique and just plain trying-too-hard, or bizarre. Realize that anything that distracts from you will do precisely that and should be left out of your application or performance routine; less is often more. Remember also that they may just be looking for the normal, usual you with all your foibles, talents, and "uninteresting" bits rolled into one because they can see something in you that matches their hoped-for scenario and to be frank, it's the weaknesses in personality that attract viewing. The demographic also matters considerably, as the full cast selection must be appealing to a wide variety of viewers., When self-assessing your suitability to go any further, some of the things that you should keep in mind include a good dose of realism. There is no point auditioning for a show that wants the complete opposite of you - they are just not going to be sold over to your way of seeing things. As such, other things to keep in mind include:   Are you the right height, weight, size, look, etc., for whatever the show focuses on? It makes little sense to apply to be in a weight loss show when you're already at an ideal weight, or to try modeling when your height isn't what they're looking for. It's pointless offering to sleep rough for a month when you're terrified of being seen naked by fellow contestants or sharing your sleeping quarters with spiders. Can you actually sing, dance, act, etc., as required? Do you have the qualifications or smarts needed? If you're applying for a show wanting people with a business background or a college education and you don't have one, again, it may not be worth your while.  It may sound trite, especially after going through all the steps above, but the shows producers will want a strong, well-founded response and not just one based merely on your wish to never work in a cocktail bar again. Formulate an answer that demonstrates your strengths, your interesting points, and a desire to be a good role model. Telling them "I want to be famous" rarely distinguishes you from every other person wanting the same. Be confident in what you believe you can contribute to the show as well as focusing on your hoped-for outcome.	Think carefully before you leap!, Think about the reality. Learn all that you can about the show before applying. Look for casting calls and auditions. Apply with care. Present yourself in an interesting way. Be practical. Know why you want to do this.
Choose a shoe with a flexible, thin sole for the dance floor. Stay away from platform shoes; that thick sole and heel make it difficult to feel the floor. Be sure, too, that your feet feel secure in you shoes. Backless sandals are best left at home. Do not wear sneakers or other shoes with rubbery or sticky soles or be prepared to pick up your feet. At best, you'll risk looking a bit herky-jerky in your movements; at worst you may find yourself with a twisted ankle or tweaked-out knee.  Tight satin might look (and feel) great, but it could inhibit your moves on the dance floor, and one wrong move could leave you with an embarrassing rip. Stay away, too, from tops or shirts that fit low in the armhole; they make it harder to move. Try on your outfit at home to be sure you can dance with ease.  If you tend to perspire, choose garments made of natural fibers. Tank tops and halter tops can look great, but sweaty or clammy skin could be a turn off if a partner asks you to dance. Drop a pack of moist towelettes and a travel-size powder in your pocket so you can freshen up when needed.	Put on your boogie shoes. Make sure you can move. Be prepared for the heat.
Find out what their hours are, what day the water park opens; many don’t open until the end of May. Starting early in the morning when they first open is a good idea because it isn’t as crowded and the lines are shorter. And buying tickets beforehand will save you time in line at the entrance gates.; , Which means packing everything you might need including:   Cell phones, sunblock, towels, swimsuits, sunglasses, comfortable shoes, camera, hats. Cooler of ice, food and water if you don’t plan on buying food inside the park. Check their website and find out what the park allows to be brought in. Some parks don’t allow food or coolers. Most water parks and many other amusement parks also prohibit glass containers of any kind. A fully stocked first aid kit. You never know when you might need a band-aid or aspirin. Although there are first aid stations, they are few and far between. Even large parks only have one or two first aid stations, so getting a band-aid can mean hiking a mile. All prescription medications that people in your group may need. This includes medications like EpiPens, inhalers, etc. And if you’re taking a large group of kids, get all of their contact information in case of an emergency. Also be informed of any preexisting medical conditions of anyone in your group. Conditions like asthma, diabetes, hypoglycemia and epilepsy can be scary if you don’t know what’s going on.  Wear comfortable shoes that you can walk all day in. Wearing loose clothing will help sweat evaporate and keep you cooler. Wearing a hat and a full coverage shirt will save you from being sun burned.  Tell the children to look for a park staff member if they get lost and make sure they have your cell number. Make sure to designate a meeting place and time to gather your group when the day is over.  Never let kids roam the park alone. Sending kids in groups of 2 or more with at least one mature teenager or adult is usually a safe bet. Make sure that each group has a cell phone or a two way radio to stay in contact. This wikiHow article provides useful information on what you should do in this scenario.  Walking around all day in the summer sun can be a recipe for disaster if you don’t drink enough fluids. You sweat out much more water than you might think; up to a liter per hour of sun exposure. So keep those water bottles in hand and drink up!  , This is especially important during the hottest part of the day (2-5) in the afternoon. It’s during this time that the pavement in the parks has absorbed all of the heat and it will start to radiate everywhere. This means even the shady spots will have heat coming up from the ground, so get into an air conditioned place to cool off.	Do some research of the park you’ll be visiting. Go fully prepared. Be sure to dress appropriately. Have a plan. Use the buddy system. Stay hydrated. Be sure to get out of the sun and take frequent breaks.
Make sure after evaluating the space, design and display you are armed with enough bottles. Create a mock candelabra with the bottles by simply arranging them to see if what you have is the desired look.  Check your workspace for a glass cutter, hammer, electric drill and possibly an electric saw (unless you can purchase pre-cut wood). You will also need sandpaper.  If possible, pre-measure for size and bring the measurements to the hardware store so they can cut them for you. , You can decorate the bottom of the bottles with beads or jewels for an added, original touch.	Gather/purchase enough bottles for your project. Locate power tools. Purchase a 2 x 4 of ½” plywood to hold your chandelier together. Pick up a 3/32” steel cable, ferrules, wax and cotton wicks at the hardware store.  , Consider purchasing special beading and paint to cover either the plywood (if you don’t plan to stain it) and a hot glue gun.
They can both be the same color, or they can be two different colors. You can even use a solid color for one piece, and a pattern for the other. Your finished blanket will measure 36 by 36 inches (91.44 by 91.44 centimeters) with a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) fringe on all four sides.  Try to cut through both layers of fleece at the same time. This will ensure that all of your edges match up.If you are using patterned fleece, make sure that the right side is facing out.  Once again, be sure to cut through both layers of fleece at the same time.,, Starting from the bottom left corner, take the first tassel from the top and bottom pieces of fleece. Holding them together, push them through the 1/4-inch (0.64-centimeter) slit you made.Gently tug on the tassels to tighten them.  This blanket is similar to the traditional tied, no-sew blanket, but because you are not tying the tassels together, you won't get as much bulk.	Cut two 40 by 40-inch (101.6 by 101.6-centimeter) pieces of fleece. Stack the two pieces of felt, then cut a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) square out of each corner. Cut a 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) wide, 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) long tassels into all four sides of your blanket. Cut a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) long slit into the top edge of each tassel.Make sure that you are making the slits right next to the body of the blanket, and not the narrow/raw end of the tassels.  , Pull the tassels through each slit. Continue pulling the tassels through the slits on all four edges of the blanket.
A good idea would be to store this jug during storm season or summertime to keep on hand during emergencies.; ,, Attach a 2-Inch Standard Bi-Metal Hole Saw to it.  You want a snug fit for your PVC pipe. ,,,, Find something that can run using batteries and being plug in.   Remove parts you won't need from the fan like the stand or base.  You want a close measurement, as you will be placing the fan on top of the lid.   Center your measurement so they fan distributes air inside the bucket evenly.       Cut out tracing using your box cutter or craft knife.  You will want to either have a power source nearby or use a battery-operated fan.   If your fan has a usb plug in a power bank or batteries.       Place the frozen gallon of water inside the bucket. Or as an option you could fill it with cubed ice and add salt for it last longer.       Replace the gallon lid so you have a tight fit.       Place the fan mouth on top of the hole you cut and make sure the fan covers the entire hole (it should be a perfect fit).  This should provide up to 6 hours of A/C.   Use batteries in case of power failure.       Perfect for outdoors.	Fill the plastic gallon jug with water and place in freezer. Get your bucket make sure you clean it first.  , Grab your power drill. Drill three large holes approximately 2” apart along the top 2/3 portion of the gallon bucket. Obtain a bucket liner or an ice box that would fit inside the bucket.  , Drop bucket liner into the bucket   Drill through liner following the pre-drilled holes you already created.        , Get a PVC pipe and cut into three 1.5” pieces.  , Push one piece of PVC pipe through each hole so at least half of the pipe is inside the bucket.  , Obtain a desk fan. Trace around the mouth of the fan with your pencil onto the lid. Assemble A/C unit. Turn on fan and feel the air begin to cool immediately.
Break it down into small pieces or crumbs. Hand ripping is fine too!; , Add the necessary amount of salt and water. Mix.  When pliable and adhering together, it is ready to use.  The bread is ideal for making beads, figurines and other small clay projects. To make beads:   Shape the bread into beads. Pierce each bead at the end of a skewer and thread it along the skewer. Bake in a slow oven (around 130ºC/250ºF) until firmed. If you have made other shapes, bake them at the same temperature also.	Process, blend or mash up the pieces of white bread. Put the pieces of bread into a bowl. Knead the dough on a clean surface. Make clay projects. Decorate the cooled beads or shapes with paint or markers as desired.
In the anime series Kakashi gives a chilling impression that you do not want to meet him in a battle. He is always calm and almost never surprised.   Slouch slightly.      ; , Always try to win and take the easy way out. Act very aloof with them and logical.  If you want to hide your eye use his technique or get a side-fringe to hide it.  As you can see in the anime he always carries books around. Try to read whole collections of books that interests you.   If your favorite book has been turned into a movie, it's a must-see movie end of story and no questions asked. , Be amazing at sports, and get ripped. Try your best in every sport.  This is incredibly important especially at work and in school. This will show people that you are serious on becoming him.   If at school or other places, you can use a face mask.

Kakashi is always serious and never makes unnecessary jokes. , Kakashi always acts half asleep but in truth he is always alert for the slightest thing out of the ordinary.    Blow off people that make a big deal about things.    When fighting, analyze and copy your opponents moves. ,, That way you can put your mouth-covering on again before anyone sees what you look like.  If someone asks something about you, don't get into too much detail; try to change the subject. , Kakashi spies on Naruto and other people all the time.	Look and be incredibly laid back and "cool". Have a competitive relationship with a spunky person. Cover up any big scars you may have, like Hatake Kakashi's Sharingan eye. Read books in your spare time. Be intelligent.  , Make sure you brush up on your physical abilities. Hide your mouth with something at all times.

Be mysterious. Be able to read people personalities.  , Know how to spy on people.
If you are using 2 different colors, cut them both to 1 1/2 feet (.45 m) long, but cut two sections of one. If you are using 3 different ribbons, cut them all to be 1 1⁄2 feet (0.5 m) long. Also cut a 3 inch (7.6 cm) piece of any of the ribbons for the middle of your finished hair bow.          Don't worry about cutting your ends yet; we'll do that near the end.; , Do it as fast as possible so it doesn't dry. If you can, have someone else helping you -- four hands work faster than two.          You probably don't want to get the glue on your carpet or nice counter top. Set down some newspapers or use a surface you're not worried messing up.  Press down cautiously and wait to dry. Try to get it as straight as possible -- you want each color to be displayed equally.          If you have only two colors, be sure to have the odd color out in the middle.  Do it fast! Pin down the ends of the first ribbon if you're worried about it moving.  Be careful while you press down as to not burn yourself. You should now have a tri-toned piece of ribbon, in all your school's colors (or whatever colors you want).          Now the ribbon is complete and you can move onto forming the bow!	Grab a few different colors of ribbon. Using the glue gun, draw a line on the edge of the first ribbon piece. Carefully place the second ribbon piece onto the wet glue. Draw another line of glue on the second ribbon piece. Carefully place the third ribbon piece onto the wet glue.
Especially if the kids are working inside the home, be sure the area is equipped with an area that allows the children to quickly wash their hands before they leave the play space.  Simply gather up the newspaper and toss along with any goopy paint or dropped dough.  That way you can easily transfer the items to a nearby sink in one trip.	Maintain easy access to soap and water near the play area. Keep the project on the newspapered area for quick clean up. Have a tub nearby to collect art supplies such as rolling pins, cookie cutters and finger paint bowls.
If you're having difficulty turning the steering wheel or a high-pitched whining noise issues from the steering wheel when you turn it, chances are your power-steering fluid is low. The power-steering fluid can be found in a cylindrical reservoir near the power steering pump or remotely located with hoses from the pump, and should be clearly labeled. The cylinder may be made of either plastic or metal.   If you can't find the cylinder, consult your owner's manual for the location. While the power-steering reservoir is usually located in the same space in most cars, newer vehicles may place them elsewhere for economy or space.; , If the reservoir cylinder is made of translucent plastic, you may be able to see the fluid level inside the cylinder. If the reservoir cylinder is made of metal, or if the plastic is not sufficiently transparent, you'll check the fluid level with a dipstick, which is usually attached to the cap.   On some cars, the power-steering fluid level can only be checked accurately after the engine has run for a brief period, and sometimes you must also turn the steering wheel in either direction several times while the car idles. On other cars, there are gradations on the dipstick or cylinder for both a "hot" level, after the engine has been running, and a "cold" level, after the engine has been off for a period of time. On still other cars, there may be "Min" and "Max" lines for acceptable fluid levels. Be sure to compare the power-steering fluid level against the correct mark.  If you are using a dipstick to test the power-steering fluid level, first wipe off any excess fluid from the dipstick when you first take it out of the cylinder, then reinsert it as far down as it will go and pull it out again.  Good power-steering fluid should be clear, amber or pinkish in color.   If the power-steering fluid is brown or black, it has been contaminated with bits of rubber from connecting hoses, seals or O-rings. In this case, the car should be taken to a mechanic to see if any of the power-steering system parts need to be replaced, along with the fluid. The power-steering fluid may look darker than it actually is. If you have any doubts, look at the color of the power-steering fluid stain on the rag or paper towel you wiped your dipstick off with. If the stain is the color the fluid is supposed to be, your fluid is not contaminated.  If your car has gradations on the cylinder, you can add the fluid steadily until you reach the correct "hot" or "cold" fill level; if you checked the level with a dipstick, add the fluid incrementally to avoid overfilling the reservoir.   Be sure to use only the power-steering fluid that is recommended for your car, as it will be the correct viscosity (thickness) for your car's power-steering system. The manufacture does not recommend using transmission fluid in place of power steering fluid. There are too many different types of fluid, and if the wrong fluid is used, it may cause failure of power steering and its seals. Be careful not to overfill your power-steering unit with fluid. It's probably better to under fill your unit than overfill it. That's because power-steering fluid expands as it heats up and works its magic. If you fill your unit all the way to the top and then try to drive your car, the expanded pressure could begin to cause problems and might necessitate expensive repairs.  Depending on the make of car, you may have to push or screw the cap into place. Be sure it's firmly attached before you close the hood.	Look for the reservoir cylinder. Check the level of the power-steering fluid. Examine how much of the dipstick is covered by power-steering fluid. Examine the color of the power-steering fluid. Add power-steering fluid as needed to the correct fill level. Replace the cylinder cap.
Before you head out, it's usually smart to think through what it is you're going to buy and make up a list. When you're at home, you'll have easy access to cookbooks and other resources that will let you find out for sure what it is you need to make spaghetti carbonara, or chicken sandwiches, without wandering around the aisles aimlessly and trying to figure out what to make for dinner, buy for an eight week camping expedition, cater for guests, re-stock your pantry or whatever else.   Write out each meal you want to cook for the period you are shopping food, if applicable. Separate your shopping lists by ingredients. Try to plan it out so might be able to re-use certain ingredients. If you need garlic and tomatoes for pasta on Monday, think of other tomato-based dishes you might be able to make later in the week. Making a list helps to keep food shopping a lot more manageable, especially if you're shopping for your family. If you've got a big group to buy for, go around and ask everyone if they have any requests so you can be sure you'll get everything. If you're not sure what to you will need, head to the market and see what looks good. Buy a variety of fresh ingredients and take them home and find out how to cook them later. This is the chef's way of doing things. Ensure you don't overstock on items that will perish before you can use them.; , Don’t come home from the store, butcher, delicatessen, market or other food vendor with three packages of bacon, bread and a fennel bulb, unless those are the foods you need to buy. Aim for a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, starches, quick snacks and meal ingredients to make your food shopping trip the most efficient possible.   Try to get in the habit of buying things you'll be able to use more than once where practicable. Buying pasta could make for a great hot dish one night and cold pasta salad when mixed with greens the next day. Hot Pockets don't have the same advantage, because they’re the same every time.  You don't want to end up with a bunch of green rocks when you thought you were getting avocados unless you plan on using them in a couple of weeks time. Pick up produce and learn to identify fruits and vegetables that are at their peak of ripeness to make the right choices.   Smell fruits and feel for the firmness of vegetables when shopping for these foods. Lots of people are intimidated by selecting produce, thinking there's some big secret. There isn't. It should look and smell like you want to eat it. If it smells like nothing, it'll probably be bland and need some time to ripen. Look for any signs of discoloration or spottiness. If vegetables look slightly spotty or feel very soft at the store, they'll probably turn before tomorrow rolls around. Unless you're going to eat something right away, buy slightly under-ripe produce. Pick up fruits and vegetables, and don't be afraid to feel them. Dig around the bin. You want most fruits like melons, lemons, and other produce to feel heavier than it looks, which is a sign of ripeness.  If you're a meat eater, buying fresh meat can be surprisingly challenging. The wall of cuts at most meat store or butcher is enormous and looks complicated. Whether you're looking for poultry, beef, or pork, spend some time looking for the best value and the highest quality. Make the freshness your first consideration.   Only buy meat that you can inspect yourself. If you can't see through the packaging, don't buy it. Look for any grayness or discoloration on poultry, beef, and pork. Check the use-by date, but use your own common sense and judgment more than the stamp that the store put on it. It's usually best to buy big, when it comes to meat, but only if you'll be able to use it. It's a lot more cost-effective, for example, to buy a roasting chicken and learn to break it down yourself, than to buy boneless and skinless breasts. Buy what you need, as basic as it comes. If you have questions, talk to someone. If you're shopping at a grocery store full of employees who don't know their products, consider going elsewhere. Smaller more independent and local butchers will know their meat intimately. They're the ones to buy from.  A common source of confusion at the grocery store or supermarkets comes from understanding what exactly organic produce and meat is and what it means. It's almost always more expensive, but learning the ways in which it differs from "normal" produce will help you to make informed decisions.   To obtain an organic certification, food producers, farmers, and livestock must have a federal inspection performed, in which the soil is tested for the presence of pesticides. There can have been no pesticides used on land certified organic for seven years in the United States.Meat, eggs, and other animal products that are certified organic must have been fed feed certified organic. "Natural" is not the same thing as "organic." If food is labeled "pesticide free" or "hormone free," it means probably that the farm or the company hasn't received it's organic certification yet, because it's an expensive and time-intensive process. It doesn't mean the food is worse, it just means it hasn't been certified. Organic produce is usually more expensive because there is a lower yield of crops, because pesticides cannot be used.While an organic apple isn't technically "better for you" than a regular apple, nutritionally, sustainably-grown produce that's organically certified is better for the environment.Long term studies about the effect of pesticide residue on health are inconclusive.  If you're going to buy any pre-prepared or packaged foods, it's a good idea to look at the list of ingredients on the back of the package. It's a good idea to get in the habit of checking out what it is you're actually eating, to learn more about nutrition and the food you buy.   Keep an eye out for preservatives and other additives that you don't recognize if this matters to you. A good rule of thumb is that if there are more complicated chemistry words that end in "-ate" or "-ide" than there are recognizable foods, it's better to buy something a little simpler. The next time you're at the store, compare a jar of "natural" peanut butter and a jar of "reduced fat" peanut butter. Natural peanut butter usually includes a pair of ingredients: peanuts and salt. Reduced fat peanut butter has a whole host of added oils and additives, to replace the flavor leached out when the peanut oil was extracted. Which is "better?"  , Learn to read food labels and you'll be able to make more informed choices about what you buy. Counting the calories and the calories from fat in each serving is important. When you look at the back of a candy bar, it might say "250 calories," which doesn't sound all that bad. When you notice, though, that the serving size is "half the bar," you've got to double all the numbers to find out what you're really getting.   Some foods labeled “low fat” or “reduced fat” are the same basic products, but the manufacturers have toyed with the serving size and fiddled with the numbers to make the product look healthier. It’s not.  If there's one thing other than rent that absolutely has to come out of your monthly paychecks, it's food. You have to eat, ergo, you have buy food, and buying affordably and responsibly at the grocery store, market, supermarket, green grocers, bakers or other food sellers, needs to be a priority in your budget, especially if you've got a sizable family.   If you want to start a budget, but aren't sure how to estimate your food costs, start saving all your receipts now. Shop normally for a month, but keep track of your receipts, or keep your total bills tallied on your phone. Add it all up at the end of the month and figure out what percentage of the money you make every month that represents. Look over your receipts and identify two categories of items: essentials and extras. Essentials should be things like fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, milk, rice, pasta, eggs, and lean meats–ingredients used to make meals. Extras are things like snack crackers, chips, sweets, and other snacking goods. If you're spending too much money on food every month, tighten up on the extras.  Learn to look at the "per unit" price on each item before you buy it, to save as many pennies as possible. This is usually listed on the label on the rack at the store, just under the big price. This tells you how much each "unit" of the item is worth.   For example, you might compare two jars of tomato sauce, which look to be basically the same shape. If one is $3.99 and the other is $4.25, it may seem obvious that you're getting the deal with the cheaper jar. But wait, the more expensive jar is 15 oz. and the less expensive is only 12. Which is the better deal? The price-per-ounce should be included on the label. That's the unit price. The lower number is the better deal. Don’t overbuy. It’s easy to waste a lot of money a few dollars at a time. A whole gallon of milk that goes sour before you can drink it all. A pound of bacon left out on the counter to spoil. Three kinds of bread all for one week when you’ll be home alone. Look for the best deal, but don't buy more than you'll be able to use before heading back to the store.  The place to go big and save money is in buying items that won't spoil or go bad in bulk. This means you won't have to go back to the store or re-buy these items in smaller portions for quite some time. It's a great way to save money.   Rice and pasta are great bulk items. If you go through a lot of rice, buy 10 pounds at a time. you might have to spend what seems like a lot, but if the per-unit price is low, and you won't have to buy rice again for six months, it's worth it. Dried beans, oatmeal, and cheap canned goods are also excellent ways to buy in bulk and save food for rainy days. If you're running a little lean some month, a big batch of oatmeal, or beans and rice for dinner can be a great way of stretching a buck. Those are some of the cheapest meals you can make.  While it might seem like it makes more cost sense to buy a single frozen lasagna instead of buying noodles, sauce, cheese, and the other ingredients necessary to make one, the per-unit price and the actual cost of the food you’re getting is much higher with frozen meals. Learn to cook and make your own dinners rather than buying the packaged variety if you are able and this is practical for you.   Health-wise, the sodium content and the preservatives added to frozen meals make them less healthy for your family than when you make it yourself. You can control the ingredients, making it tastier and healthier.  Whatever store you're visiting, check the bargain shelf. All stores have them, from Walmart to Target to the supplement store that smells like patchouli. Look for an area of the store with marked down or over-market stock that you can get on the cheap. This is an especially great place to get sauces, canned goods, and other foods.   Lots of people are scared to buy "out of date" products. Dates are often placed arbitrarily, and getting people to think they need to use a product "before it goes bad" is a way of getting people to buy more stuff and spend more money. If an item says, "Best by" that means it won't go bad for a long time past that date, if at all.  Many stores will have coupon inserts available in local papers and at the front door of the store when you head inside. These are good ways of checking out the deals and the discounts on produce and other items, and can be a great way to save money.   Coupons can also be used to get people hooked on stuff. Don't buy two boxes of chocolate peanut butter cups just because it was on sale. Buy food you're already shopping for.  If you're struggling to pay for food regularly there may help. Applying for Federal food assistance and getting financial aid for purchasing food is an important step to take, as long as you meet the criteria. Look for a charity food bank near you.   Commonly called "food stamps" or "EBT," different regions in different countries handle food assistance in different ways, most often with an electronic debit card that includes a certain amount of money per month that can go toward food. Learn more about assistance in your area by clicking here.  If you need to stock up on food, food vendors are the places to go. There are lots of different styles and specialty stores, and some may be more appropriate for you, given what it is you're looking for. You probably shouldn't go looking for sushi-grade salmon at Walmart, and you probably shouldn't expect to find super-cheap saltines at the Natural Food Co-Op. Learn what different places specialize in and shop for different foods at the right place.   Chain groceries and box stores like Safeway, Kroger, Sainsbury's, and Woolworth's, Tesco, New World, etc specialize in affordable perishable and nonperishable food. Box stores like Walmart, Meijer, Target, and other chains also have grocery sections that are expansive and usually cheap. These are good places to visit for name-brand goods and find deals. Natural groceries and specialty vendors may be the best place to visit for local produce, fresh vegetables, and raw ingredients, but they tend to be more expensive than chain stores. You're paying for quality. Food cooperatives are common in some places, allowing you to buy in to a partial ownership of the store and decide what should be stocked. If required, check out bulk suppliers - these used to be called Cash and Carry. You may need to buy a membership card, but you could save money if you need to buy food in bulk. Corner stores, convenience stores, dairies and local shops are good places for prepared food, snacks, and alcohol, but not great places to find fresh vegetables or fruits unless you have no other option.  Grocery outlets supply overstocked off-brand food that can be purchased for much cheaper than at regular grocery stores. Amelia's and ALDI are common examples of this, offering a somewhat limited variety of fresh and non-perishable foods for much cheaper than at the bigger stores.   You don't have the same variety, so it's not the place to go looking for super-specific ingredients, but it's a good place to find staples, like cooking oil, sugar, or vinegar. It's also a good place for things like snack crackers, bread, and other off-brand goods.  By far where practical, the best place to find quality produce where you live is to find out about local farmers' markets. Typically held on weekends, farmers' markets combine a festival-like atmosphere with outdoor stalls and extremely fresh produce. Depending on the climate, this might only happen during the harvest season, but some markets go year-round in certain climates. These are excellent places to get fresh fruits, organic vegetables, and local meat raised in a humane way.   Markets also give you a chance to see and interact with the people who grow, prepare, and sell your food. It's a lot more personal than buying cookies at the corner store. Markets are also a good place to find out about Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in your area, if applicable. Many booths may offer CSA packages, which allow you to buy into the farm, essentially paying an up-front or a monthly price for a package of fresh vegetables that you can pick up or have delivered.  Like anything, it's also possible to buy certain specialty ingredients online and have it delivered. This can be an excellent choice if you live somewhere very remote and struggle to find access to certain ingredients or fresh supplies in your area. Everything from organic gummy bears to bulk bags of caraway seeds and jasmine rice can be had for decent prices online.   Coffee co-ops are very popular online options, letting you buy in and "subscribe" to a coffee club that will deliver high-quality whole beans directly to your door. If you're a coffee-food eater, it's a no-brainer. Citrus delivery doesn't have to be reserved for Christmas-time. Since citrus can only grow in limited climates, having high-quality oranges, grapefruits, lemons and limes delivered straight to your door is another great option if this happens where you live.  Increasingly, stores are charging for the use of plastic or paper bags, making it much more cost-effective to buy one and take it with you when food shopping. It's also cutting down a lot on waste to get rid of those 20 useless plastic bags that come home with you every time you head to the store. Invest in five or six good quality tote-bags and keep them in your car, or near the front door so you'll remember them when you head to the store.  Sometimes, you just don't feel like cooking. While it's usually more cost-effective to cook meals at home and get more bang for your buck, if you're solo it can be a whole lot easier buy food buy going out for a sandwich than to buy a bunch of ingredients to cook at home. One always-easy way of buying food is to buy it already made at the restaurant.	List what food you need to buy before you go to the store, market, shop or restaurant. Buy a variety of foods. Check the ripeness of produce. Buy fresh meat. Learn the difference between certified-organic products and regular products if this matters to you. Look at the ingredients in packaged foods. Pay attention to serving sizes. Create a food budget. Find out the "per unit" price of each item. Buy non-perishable items in bulk. Avoid frozen meals unless this is a food you need. Look for specialty deals and discounts at the store. Look for coupons if practical. Consider applying for food assistance. Find a food vendor close to you where practical. Look for grocery outlets in your area. Look for local farmers’ markets. Buy specialty food items online. Take bags with you to the store, market or shop. Go to a restaurant.
There are a couple ways to do this: You could ask around, see if some friends/parents recycle glass bottles. Many people will gladly give you their old bottles. You could also try dumpster diving, but be aware that this may be illegal and possibly dangerous. Finally, if you absolutely cannot/do not want to try the other methods, you can always just go to the store and buy some glass bottles.; , This will help guide your hand as you cut the neck off.  This is not optional, as glass dust inhalation can cause silicosis, a fatal condition that results from particle inhalation, and glass shards could fly from the bottle, and damage your eyes. The only alternative is to have a rig set up to constantly drip water onto the cut, or for the bottle to be submerged while you cut, as this will keep the glass dust from flying.  Make sure to insert it properly and tighten the collet properly.  As long as you are around this speed, you'll be okay, but you will need a variable speed dremel for this.  Remember, the key to using a dremel is not to put pressure on the material, but to use the speed to remove the glass. Just let your diamond wheel lightly touch the neck, and rotate the bottle. This will take many passes.  Don't rush this, let it happen on it's own, in order to create a clean cut. , Wash it until the glass dust is gone from the slide.	Obtain your bottles. Using your electrical tape, tape the bottle neck right above where you would like to cut it. Put on your respirator mask and safety glasses/goggles. Insert the 545 Diamond Wheel into your dremel. Put your dremel at about 15,000 RPMs. Slowly grind away at the neck, using the tape as a guide. After about five to ten minutes of grinding, the neck should, quite literally, drop off. To smooth the now cut edge, you can either: Use the face of the diamond wheel to grind away the edges until smooth, or attach a silicon carbide grinding accessory, and grind away the edges.  , Run some water, and remove the tape from the slide. If you would like to have a polished edge, insert a polishing disk, and use some polishing compound to give the glass a nice, finished look.
The best type of leaves to work with have a waxy, glossy surface, like magnolia or gardenia leaves., You will need ½ to ¾ cups (70 to 105 grams) of washing soda and 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water. Give the solution a gentle stir to combine it.Do not use baking soda; it is not the same thing.Washing soda is also called "sodium carbonate." You can find it in the laundry section of grocery stores and supermarkets., Bring the water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat first, then reduce it to a simmer. Cook the leaves until they turn soft. This will take about 90 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the type of leaf you are using.The water will evaporate as you simmer it. Add more water to the pot as needed so that the leaves don't dry out., Put on a pair of plastic or rubber gloves first. Next, use a pair of tongs or a spatula to remove the leaves from the water.If the leaves are pulpy and gloopy, soak them in a tub filled with water; this will make cleaning them easier later on.  Hold the leaves by the stem with tweezers, and use a paintbrush or a soft toothbrush to gently brush the pulp away. Turn the leaf over, and scrape the other side clean too.It would be even better if you work while the leaves are under water.Be very gentle during this step; the leaves will be fragile., The leaves will be very delicate at this stage, so be gentle with them. Fill a tub with water, and soak the leaves in the water. You can gently swish them about, but only if you are careful. Change the water and repeat the step, if necessary.  Do not rinse the leaves under running away; the force of the stream will damage them.  If you want the leaves to dry flat, you will need to place them between two paper towels and heavy books. The paper towels will help absorb the excess moisture while the books will help make the leaves dry flat. If you don't do this, the leaves may warp and curl, which is fine if that's the look you are going for.	Place the leaves you want to use into a saucepan. Cover the leaves with washing soda and water. Cook the leaves until they soften. Remove the leaves from the water. Set the leaves onto a paper towel and gently brush the leaf pulp away. Rinse the leaves in fresh water once more. Allow the leaves to dry.
Let them know that the band is coming and you are interested. Chances are your parents aren't going to pay for your ticket so you are going to need to save up money.; , You just heard your favorite band is coming to town and you want to go to their concert. The first thing you should do is go to ticketmaster.com. Ticket Master sells tickets for almost any event and you should be able to find yours. Find out how much tickets are going to cost, location, and time.  Post on Facebook, Instagram , Twitter, etc. that you are going to the concert and maybe someone else wants to go to. Concerts are always more fun in groups.  Ask your parents for a loan if you don't have any money. Tell them you will pay them back with interest. If they say no, find another source of money. Mow lawns, babysit, walk dogs, etc.  You have a better chance of getting better seats for your price range.  You need a ride. Talk to your parents about giving you a ride. If the concert is in a large city traffic will be bad most likely. If your parents can't give you a ride, talk to parents of friends who are going, family, older siblings, etc. You can always take the bus too.  If not, go buy it during a song that you don't mind missing.  Concerts are very crowded. There will always be smokers, druggies, crazies, and drunks. If you are by one of these people and are uncomfortable, talk to security and explain the situation. Most of the time they will understand and move you.  The concert has ended and it's time to leave. This is a very dangerous time. Lots of people trying to go to one place is crazy. Make sure everyone has their cell phones or is with someone who has one. Make a plan. Tell whoever is picking you up a very specific place to get you. If anyone gets separated from the group, then they know where to go.	Talk to your parents. Find out the price of a ticket. If you have friends that like the band, ask them if they would want to come too. Find a way to buy your ticket. Buy your tickets soon as they go on sale. Go to the concert!, If you are planning on buying a T-shirt, do it soon as you get past the gate if you have time before the concert starts. Always stay in groups of 2 at least. Be careful when leaving.
This simple method ensures the vest will be a good fit without the hassle of measurements, etc.; , Seam allowance is the part that gets folded under when you make the seams. , For each half, fold the t-shirt in half vertically and trace around it, adding seam allowance along the outer edge plus a little extra room for the front-center overlap if desired (e.g., where you'd put snaps or buttons).  Again, add room (1/2 inch) for the seam allowance. Keep in mind the back may have a higher neckline than the front pieces, depending on your design.  Put the cutout pieces together as they would be for the vest, making sure the armholes and hem line up., You'll need at least 1 to 1 1/2 yards for the vest, and an equal amount for the lining.   The lining is the part that goes inside the vest, on the reverse side of the outer cloth. If you have doubts as to how much fabric you need, take your pattern to the fabric or craft store and ask for help. It's always better to have a bit extra material than not enough. You can choose from a wide range of materials for your vest. Keep in mind the season when selecting your fabric; for example, you can use a light wool for autumn, velvet for winter, seersucker for spring, and silk or light cotton for summer.  On a large working surface, lay the fabric out. Place the cutout patterns on top, pinning them together to avoid slippage. Use a pen to trace the outline onto the fabric.  Remove the pattern pieces and use a pen to mark a dotted line around the fabric about 1/2 inch from the edge (your seam allowance). You'll follow this line when you sew up the vest., When you've finished this, check that the lining pieces line up with the vest pieces.  At this point, you are not sewing the lining to the vest, but rather working on the two parts separately.Right sides together (RST) means that the insides of your seam – the parts touching each other – are the right sides of the cloth (the part with the pattern and/or the one that will be seen in the finished product), while the wrong sides are showing outside.At this point, it may be helpful to press the seams flat with an iron if your fabric allows.  Line up the vest and lining pieces, making sure the side seams and shoulder openings match up. Pin them together and sew along all sides except the shoulder seams (the part at the top between the neck and shoulder openings)., At this point, the right side of the fabric should be visible for both liner and vest.  First fold the top 1/2 inch of the back shoulder piece under, then tuck the front piece in. Place a pin at either end of the shoulder seam and sew together on the back piece, about 1/8 inch from the edge. Repeat for the other shoulder seam.  While for some vests this may not be desirable, it adds a crisp finish to more tailored pieces. You can make topstitch with your sewing machine.   For a subtle topstitch, use a regular or lightweight thread that is a similar shade as the fabric. For more contrast, choose a heavier thread and/or a contrasting color. Press the vest before adding topstitch for better accuracy., If you want the option of closing your vest, you'll need to decide how. Buttons and snaps are popular options and easy to add.   Measure where you want your closures to go. You can eyeball the top and bottom closures and then measure and mark precisely where the middle closures should be. Ensure you have the positions marked evenly on both inside edges so that they line up.  Follow the directions for your particular snap plier. First affix the stub to one side, and next the socket to the other.    To make button holes by hand, sew two parallel satin stitches the length of the button and connect them at the top and bottom (these are called bar tacks). Place pins at either end of the hole, just along the bar tacks, and slice open the fabric in between the seams using a seam ripper or small, sharp scissors. Alternatively, your sewing machine might have an attachment for button holes. Lucky you!Sew buttons onto the opposite side of the button holes.	Trace a tank top or a t-shirt (with sleeves tucked in so you can get the arm openings) onto pieces of newspaper or a brown paper bag that's been opened up. Add about 1/2 inch (about 13 mm) around the entire outline for seam allowance. Make the front piece in two halves. Make the back piece by laying the t-shirt flat and tracing along it. Cut out the pattern pieces and inspect. Buy your cloth. Cut out the fabric. Mark the stitching lines on the wrong side (the side you won't see in the finished product). Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for your lining cloth. Using a sewing machine, sew side seams right sides together (RST), vest to vest, lining to lining. Sew the vest and lining fabrics together RST, leaving the shoulder seams open. Turn the fabric inside-out by pulling it through one of the shoulder seams. Pin and sew shoulder seams. Add a row of topstitch 1/8 inch all the way along the edge (optional).A topstitch is a stitch visible from the fabric's right side. Decide on a closure type. Add snaps with a snap plier tool. Add buttons by making button holes and sewing buttons on the opposite side.
These sprinklers are unique, because they travel along a hose as they water the lawn. The hose is put in place, and the sprinkler is self-propelled along the hose.   Traveling sprinklers are expensive to purchase. The metal type seems to hold up better than ones with plastic parts. This type of sprinkler is quiet when operating. Once it is put in place, it is easy to operate.	Pick traveling sprinklers if you have a narrow or irregular shaped lawn.
Find one or more where you can see the dancers' whole bodies for as much of the video as possible. You may want to get a slowed-down or mirrored version of the video for extra help. Putting the video on your ipod/mp3 player can be helpful for learning on-the-go.; , There are often multiple dancers in one video doing different things, and you don't want to get confused over what you're supposed to be doing. If you are learning the dance alone, however, it may be more advantageous and interesting for your audience to follow whichever dancer is in front at the time. It's your choice.  Study the video, try one move, and look at the video again to see if you're doing it right. Then do the move with the video. For complicated moves, slow down or pause the video. Make an attempt at the move, even if it's not very close, and refine it until you do get the move. Mirrors are helpful! Do this for each move, one at a time.  Look at how each move flows into the next. Make sure you don't have any 'dead periods' where you're not doing anything. This usually means that there's more to the moves before or after the dead period, or that the moves take a little longer.  This means going back through the video and making sure you're doing everything exactly right, or as close to perfect as possible. Dance with the video, or videotape yourself so you can compare. Even ask friends for their honest critique, preferably those who are more skilled than you or who have already learned the dance. There are so many people who skip this step, but still think they've learned the dance. Without polish, you'll look horribly sloppy and all your efforts will have been for nothing.  The better you learn the dance, the easier it will be and the more awesome it will look. Practice it over and over again until you don't have to think about what you're doing. Make sure to keep up the quality of your dance; don't get lazy!  , Find someone to show all your hard work to! You might even inspire someone else! You can try filming yourself and uploading the video to Youtube.	Download/Buy/Bookmark the video(s) you want to learn the dance from. Pick the person/character whose moves you will be learning. Start learning the moves. When you have a section of moves worked out, do them together. Once you've learned all the moves, polish them. Practice!, Perform.
Inner spring is the most common mattress type, and almost every mattress store will carry this model. Chances are you have either seen or slept on this type of mattress before. The inner spring mattress is usually distinguished by coil count. Generally, the higher the coil count, the higher the price. However, these types of mattresses are available in all price ranges.; , Foam mattresses are made of memory foam, which is soft and conforms to the body. It is good for people who desire extra softness. This type is often more expensive than the inner spring type of mattress because it conforms to people's bodies. This can be good for some people and a negative for others. For example, people with pressure points and joint problems may prefer a foam mattress. Some people find that this type of mattress makes them uncomfortably warm.Maybe your current mattress is quite soft, and you want to find a bed with adequate firmness. If this is your situation, then you may want to avoid memory foam and stick to an inner-spring type of mattress.  Air mattresses can be adjusted by the user for an appropriate amount of softness. This is done with an electric pump. Sleep Number beds are the most well known type of air mattress. These beds are separated into 2 areas, which can be controlled by remotes. The air pockets above the coils can be firm or soft. Often times, mattresses like this will have a foam covering as well. If you disagree about the type of mattress you and your partner want, you should consider an air mattress., There are characteristics in mattresses that you may specifically want or need. For instance, you might want to make sure you are buying an “eco-friendly” mattress. In that case, research potential mattresses to see if they were built to either OE Standards or the Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS).If you have pain or simply feel uncomfortable, you may want a bed with adjustable positioning. This type of bed will allow you to rest at an incline., You might consider a twin if you are by yourself. Maybe you’re alone, but you want some extra space. In that case, a full could be what you want. Queen size and king size beds are generally preferred by couples.   Twin, full, queen, and king are all standard mattress sizes. However, if these sizes are too small for you, then you may want to consider the California King size. This extra large mattress is 72 by 84 inches (182 cm by 213 cm)., Lie on the mattress in your regular fashion. Aim to spend at least 15 minutes on the mattress.You want to create a sleeping situation as close to the one you have at home. Make sure that you change positions frequently in order to imitate how you would normally go to sleep. Never buy a mattress that is untested.   If you will share the mattress, make sure both people try it before you buy.  Look at the space where your bed will go, and measure it with a tape ruler. The size of the bed will depend on the size of the room. Another way to get an accurate measure of this, if you already have a mattress, is to place the mattress on the floor of your room. By doing this, you will see exactly how much space the mattress itself will take up. This will be incredibly helpful in choosing what type of bed frame to buy.   Common bed frame sizes are twin, full, queen, and king. A twin bed frame will fit in a space of 39 inches by 70 inches (99 to 178 cm). For a full bed frame, you will generally need a space measuring 54 by 75 inches (137 by 190 cm). 60 by 80 inches (152 by 203 cm) is a large enough space for a queen bed frame. A king bed frame will require 72 by 84 inches (183 by 213 cm). These sizes vary between the EU and United States. You should note this in case you buy the bed frame or mattress from a retailer in an EU country. , Then, determine if you need a high or low bed frame. So, if you have a mattress that’s four inches high, then you might want to consider a high bed frame. Using a low bed frame with this mattress might lead to your bed standing too close to the floor.   You don’t want the bed frame to be so high that it is difficult to get in and out. At the same time, you don’t want to get a bed frame that is so low that your mattress is touching the ground.  Measure how tall you are. A bed frame that is too small will be uncomfortable, because you will consistently be banging your head or feet when you get into it. Use your height to decide if you need a bed frame with a foot board. If you don’t, you can buy minimal bed frames in both wood and metal.  This type of bed frame has wooden slats that hold your mattress up. If you are in the market for a smaller frame, consider buying a platform bed frame. With some beds, you may not need a box spring in addition to the platform. Take into account that platform bed frames are generally closer to the ground than other bed frames.  Depending on your living situation, you might need a bed that has multiple functions. If your apartment or room is quite small, then you might benefit from a bed that can store your things. A bed frame with bottom storage will have space under the bed for books, supplies, and other possessions. Usually, this storage area is located under the place where you will put your mattress.  Pick a frame with colors and décor style that you like. Page through décor magazines such as Pottery Barn, West Elm, Ikea, Restoration Hardware and Crate and Barrel. Try to take detailed notes about what you like. Choose your style and then go comparison shopping in furniture stores or in box stores, like Target.  Give yourself some time to buy the perfect bed. Don’t simply buy the first thing that you see. You want to make sure that you have done thorough research. The more rushed you are in making a purchase, the less likely you are to find a good deal.  Buy your mattress in May if possible. Mattress companies often come out with new models in May or June. These are also months when retailers will mark down old models. Other good times include holidays, like Labor Day and President’s Day, when furniture stores have big sales. , Unless you are completely sure, it is best to avoid buying a mattress online. If you slept on the mattress while staying with friends or at a bed and breakfast, you may be able to order it at discount online without too much worry. Yes, there are definitely cheap options on the Internet; however, since you usually won’t be able to see the bed firsthand, you should be wary of online deals.  After you test out mattresses at several stores, look online for the best prices. Make sure to include shipping costs and warranties. The price you calculate online may be cheaper than what is offered in-store, in which case you can bring the price into a store to ask for a price reduction. After going to several stores, create a comparison sheet between retailers.  Talk to the salesperson and ask if they offer a comfort guarantee. A comfort warranty states that if the bed is not comfortable, then you can exchange or return it. If they do, ask for specific details. You want to know if you will need to exchange the bed or pay for the bed to be shipped back. Generally, this is included in the mattress price.   Give preference to any retailer that gives a comfort guarantee for 1 year after purchase.  Look for any discounts available. For example, some stores give you a discount for buying a bed set. Sold separately, a box spring and mattress can be over $1,000 each. However, most bed stores are willing to make a deal when you purchase both at once. Some stores offer prices reduction if you find that another store has a cheaper price for the same item. You should also ask about payment plans, and if it is possible to sign up for one.  Going this route depends on your budget. If you think you can pay for the bed immediately, then you probably shouldn’t use an installment plan. However, if you can’t pay for your bed up front, many furniture stores still offer installment payments. Speak to the salesperson, and ask for information about this option.   All plans are not the same. For example, stores will often ask you to go through a third party lender such as a bank or finance company. Usually, these institutions will need to approve you for credit. They may also have minimum purchase amounts and application fees.	Purchase an inner spring mattress. Consider buying a foam mattress. Look into air mattresses. Consider significant additional features. Choose a size preference. Test your mattress. Measure your room.

Consider interest-free financing.
With this example, the center of the yarn is going on the center of the head -- so double whatever length you want from the top of the hairline to the tip of the yarn.   Arrange them in an orderly pile. You should be able to pick them up with one hand, like a bunch of noodles. But make sure the ends all line up!  , Line up a felt strip as backing through the very middle of the strands and being sewing sections with a back stitch. This will end up being your center part.   Continue sewing until the entire felt strip is sewn onto the strands of yarn. Once you're done, flip it over.  This will keep the wig in place when it is being worn. Sew it on the end where you began with the felt strip. The teeth of the comb should be facing toward the yarn, not away. Place it directly on top of the felt (when held upside-down), so the comb won't be seen through the yarn.   The comb should be only 3 or 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) wide. It should not be wider than the felt strip. Use one of the comb-like hair accessories that can be purchased in most big box or drug stores.  You may have some pieces that have magically gotten longer or shorter; trim and style your wig until it meets your expectations.   An easy way to style the wig is to tie each side with a ribbon about halfway down the length of the hair. It keeps it from getting tangled and getting in the wearer's eyes -- and it's cute!  ,	Cut your yarn to the desired length. Find the center. Sew on a comb. Adjust and cut to your liking. Finished.
There are several companies that compile and sell vehicle history reports. A vehicle history report is a comprehensive history that includes data on a vehicle’s manufacture, sales, and sometimes repair information. Try websites like:   Carfax Autocheck, After submitting your VIN, the third-party website may prompt you to pay a fee for a complete vehicle history report. While you may not want to pay, it is standard for companies to charge for this service.   Feel free to shop around. Different websites or companies may offer different prices. In addition, some companies may run promos on vehicle history reports at different times. Fees normally range from between $20 to $40 dollars to receive a full vehicle history report. Some websites may provide cheaper rates per report if you want several vehicle history reports. For example, you may be able to get 5 reports for $59.99., Once you get your report back, you’ll need to take a good look at it so you can get a good idea of the car’s history, options, and other information. When reading the report:   Verify the report matches the VIN you submitted. Read about the car's production and the vehicle's repair and registration history in the report. Look to see if the vehicle has been repaired or if the report shows any evidence of aftermarket upgrades.	Submit your VIN to a third-party website. Pay a fee. Examine the report.
, Older single pane windows transmit (lose) heat more quickly than newer double or triple glazed windows which are far better at isolating different air temperatures on either side.,, A space below an attic with insulated floors or located above a basement are considered insulated.,, Most spaces require 10 watts per square foot of space for homes built since the 1970s. A 12 foot (3.7 m) by 12 foot (3.7 m) room has 144 sq/ft. Assuming a ceiling height less than 8 feet (2.4 m), this room should be heated comfortably with 1500 watts of heat. 1500 watts of heat is a total of 6 feet (1.8 m) of heat, assuming "standard density" baseboard heaters are selected for installation. Standard density heat is rated at 250 watts per foot. There is one other type of heat called "high density" (HD). HD heat has more than the 250 watts per foot that the standard density heat has, but does not heat quicker nor is operated for any less. HD merely provides more heat with a smaller footprint., All of the considerations above (windows type and number, insulation, etc.) will come into play when purchasing heaters. The baseline wattage should be increased by up to 100% if the room suffers from all of the considerations. It is important to note that adding additional heaters will not increase the cost of operation. Additional heaters allow the room to maintain desired temperature during the colder days, as opposed to having the minimum heat (or baseline) installed. If only the baseline calculated amount of heat were installed, it would not be able to replace the heat as quickly as it was lost due to lack of insulation, single pane windows, etc. A room that ideally requires 1500 watts of heat might need as much as 3000 watts if it suffers from all the issues listed above. This applies to ALL types of heat (and cooling in the summer for that matter), regardless of fuel type or technology. Insulation is inexpensive over the long run., The heat can be installed one of two ways. In the example room, install (1) 1500 watt heater or install 2 or more heaters totaling 1500 watts. The latter method can be employed for rooms at the corners of a building - having 2 exterior walls. Typically, heaters are installed below windows, where most of the heat loss occurs. Adding more watts of heat will allow the room to reach the desired temperature faster than if no additional watts of heat were installed., Installing 240 volt heaters is best as wire sizes and number of circuits are significantly reduced. The National Electrical Code allows a 15 amp circuit to carry up to 12 amps, and a 20 amp circuit may carry up to 16 amps. The total watts allowed to be connected can be determined simply by multiplying volts by amps only because this is a purely resistive AC circuit (AC wattage calculations are much more complex for inductive and capacitive reactant circuits that exist in appliances and electronics). The 15 amp circuit is 240 x 12 = 2880 watts. The 20 amp circuit is 240 x 16 = 3840 watts. This is a maximum of 14 and 19 feet of 240 volt, standard density heat, respectively., The thermostat should be located on an interior wall. It should never be located above a heater or other heat source, or in a dead air space such as behind a door., Cut the wall open with knife or hand saw., This may require fishing or snaking of the cable between the points, and will probably be most time consuming. For this reason, many times a single heater sized to heat the entire space is often selected so that fishing or snaking is minimized. Indicate this cable as the "LINE" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Examine the heater(s) and remove BOTH front covers from both ends of each heater. Place the heater(s) against the wall at the desired location., Because they are provided, no box(es) need be installed in the wall. Simply create a small hole in the wall for the cable from which to emerge and pass through appropriate connectors at the back of one of the compartments to allow the cables to enter. Connections are to be made in the compartments. This is detailed below., Indicate this cable as the "LOAD" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Continue to daisy-chain between successive heaters as needed.,, Push the cable into the connector until 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of the jacket is inside the wiring compartment.,,,,,,,,,,,, Connect ALL the bare and any green wires together with a wirenut. Install a short piece (8") of bare wire between the bare and green wires to the green screw on the thermostat if it is not already connected., Carefully inspect the thermostat for "LINE" and/or "LOAD" markings., Each of the black and white wires from the panel must connect to one LINE wire or terminal. Under no circumstances should the black and white wire from the panel be connected together., Connect it in the same manner as the LINE side.,	Determine room size in square feet by multiplying length by width in feet. , Determine window type and number.Determine number of walls of the space that are exterior walls. Determine if the exterior walls and space directly above and below the room are insulated.Determine if any doors open to the outdoors from this room. Calculate a baseline for total watts of electric heat required to heat the space. Determine how much (if any) more watts of heat over the baseline watts to install. Decide if / or how to break up the heaters. Determine size and number of circuits required to serve the heating load. Determine a location for the thermostat. Trace a switch box on the wall at 60 inches (152.4 cm) up from the floor for the thermostat where there are no framing members, etc. Provide a 2 wire circuit (#14 for 15 amp circuit or #12 for 20 amp circuit) of NM type (Romex) or similar cable from the electrical panel to the thermostat location. Unpack the heater(s). The two ends are wiring compartments. Provide another 2 wire cable the same size as the one installed earlier between the panel and thermostat, between the thermostat and the baseboard heater. Install an additional 2 wire cable between the first heater and next heater.Install the appropriate cable connector in the desired end of the heater(s). Strip 8 inches (20.3 cm) of jacket from the cable(s) and install into the connector.Remove the wirenut from the heater wires in the compartment that the cables entered, and separate the wires.Connect the black wires of the cables you installed together if two cables were installed.Connect the white wires of the cables you installed together if two cables were installed.Connect the bare wires of the cables you installed together if two cables were installed.Connect the bare wire(s) to the green screw of the heater or, if provided, to the green or bare wire that is connected to the heater case by crimp or screw.Connect one of the loose heater wires (does not matter which) to the black wire(s).Connect the remaining loose heater wire to the white wire(s).Make sure the wirenut in the wiring compartment at the opposite end of the heater has the wires tightly connected together.Secure the heater to the wall.Secure the wiring compartment covers.Repeat for each heater. Wire the thermostat. The thermostat has (4) wires or terminals. Connect LINE side to the black and white wires of the cable that was indicated as "feed" earlier. Connect the remaining cable to the LOAD side of the thermostat.Coil the wires, never fold, into the back of the box and secure the thermostat.
As with the basic partner dance, the leader steps back on his or her right foot while the follower steps back on his or her left.   Continue holding hands as you step back.  The leader lets go of the follower’s right hand and uses his or her left hand to guide the turn.  The leader gently pulls the follower forward on his or her right foot. The follower plants his or her right foot, which he or she will turn on.   Almost simultaneously the leader also lifts the follower’s right hand and arm to begin the turn.  As the leader turns the follower, he or she steps forward and to the side on his or her left foot and completes the turn, bringing them to neutral.   The count is 1 when they both step back, 2 when the follower steps forward and the turn begins, 3 when the leader steps forward and to the side to complete the turn, and 4 when they come back together to neutral.	Step backward together. Release hands. Begin the turn. Finish the turn.
You can find this in the owner's manual, on a sticker inside the driver-side door jamb, or in the glove compartment.   It may be the same for all four tires, or the front and rear tires may be different—it differs by model. Normally, it will be in the range of 28 to 36 psi (pounds per square inch) or 195 to 250 kPa (kilopascals). You can also find the maximum tire pressure on the tires themselves, but use this only if you can't find the vehicle's recommended numbers. "Maximum" doesn't necessarily translate to "best." A good rule of thumb is to set the tires to 32 psi. Then find the proper pressure and correct as needed.; , Warm air expands, and will give you a false reading of greater pressure.  This is the little black or silver stem poking out from your wheel. Remove the cap, and put it where you won't lose it.          There are two kinds of valve stems: rubber valve stems and metal valve stems that are on wheels equipped with TPMS (tire pressure monitoring systems).  Place the plug end of the gauge squarely onto the valve stem, and press down firmly. It may hear the hissing of air escaping; if so, press harder until the hissing stops. Read the gauge as directed to determine the pressure.          If the tire pressure matches the recommended number, replace the cap and move to the next tire. Repeat this process for all four tires, plus the spare. Should you run flat, it's not going to be helpful to have a flat spare!	Find the recommended pressure. Check the tires when cool. Remove the screw-on cap from the valve. Attach the gauge.
Think that you are better than other people but do not go overboard. Acknowledge the fact that you will lose at times and there will be people with skills and techniques that are way better than yours.   If you want to be arrogant, try practicing as well to let your skills do the talking. Do stamina training, sit ups for the stomach and push ups for the arms. Adjust your timetable, practice tennis and get your level of fitness up. Tip: Create ingenious names for your techniques. Seriously, does "Super Ultra Great Delicious Mountain Storm" even give you the chills? How about the "Super Great Momoshiro Special?" If you want to be cool and arrogant, stick to your great play and techniques with daunting names. (PS: No offense meant Kintaro-kun and Momo senpai! But seriously, pfft.)      ; , Listen more and try to get it right the first time. It is easier said than done but really, if you want to be like Echizen Ryoma, watch and learn stuffs in one hell of an observation. (You could learn a thing or two from beloved Atobe's Insight and Atobe Kingdom. Brace yourself though as you probably might be awed at the sight of his prowess.  Do not lose yourself amid any situation. Practice meditation and always focus on keeping your composure. (Oh and by meditation, it means you always have to drink a can of Ponta to keep your cool. Formula: a can of aspartame = damaged brain cells which will lead to a calm state of mind)  , Beat all the challenges that come your way with determination and show that you are not afraid of anything. (Tip: You might want to learn from Rikkaidai's mother-captain, Yukimura Seiichi or from the venerable buchou of Fudomine, Tachibana Kippei. They most certainly embody the essence of high admiration as seen from their respective teams.)  , Like Ryoma Echizen, do not be afraid to take on any challenge no matter what it is or who you might face.  Study hard o-chibi!  , Remember that you will go far kid. Surpass your senpais and become a real prince of tennis!  , Watch The Prince of Tennis and try to dress and speak like Ryoma.

If you need to resize it, do so using the graph technique of enlarging or reducing, as the pattern is very simple.; , Pin the template to the calico fabric piece.  Repeat to obtain two elephant shapes.   Pin the two shapes together.  Use a simple sewing stitch, just be sure to keep it fairly even. The style is naive art, so it doesn't need to be perfect; in fact, imperfection is part of this elephant's charm. Do not sew all the way – leave a hole for stuffing the elephant.  Push in the stuffing carefully. Be sure to get it into the trunk, into the toes, and into the tail zone.   At this stage, you might like to add the elephant's heart and brains (stars). Optional but a very special step for children making the elephant. , Cut a suitable length of tail from the braid. To prevent fraying of the braid, tie a knot.   Fray out the threads outside of the knot give the impression of the tail's end. Sew the other end of the tail to the elephant's backside. Check that it is sitting properly.  Cut a small elephant's ear shape from the felt. Be sure to proportion it with the size of your elephant. Stitch the ear to the top layer of the elephant at the long edge. This will allow the ear to "flap" when moved. Tie off well.  Use embroidery thread to create an eye. You can either sew around and around to make an eye, or use a French knit.  Use two strands of embroidery thread (single knot) to create trunk lines. Sew up and down only.   It might be easier to draw in the toe shapes first. Use a disappearing marker for best results.       Use simple stitch lines to outline the toes.  Plump up your newborn elephant and he is ready for play or to embellish another one of your craft projects.	Print off the pattern template supplied here. Cut the pattern template out. Cut around the elephant shape. Begin sewing around the edge of the elephant. Add the stuffing. Finish stitching around the hole and tie off.  , Prepare the tail. Add the ear. Embroider an eye. Sew in the trunk lines. Sew in the toes. Finish up.
To keep your cup holders clean, invest in washable inserts for the holders. You can find inserts made of rubber that fit in the cup holders. When you notice the inserts are dirty, simply take them out and wipe them off to keep them clean.Look for washable inserts for cup holders online or at your local hardware store in the car accessories section.  For a more stylish option, get cup coasters made of ceramic for the holders. The cup coasters sit at the bottom of the holders and act as a buffer between any spills or gunk that can get on the holders. You can buy ceramic cup coasters with fun patterns or designs on them to add some personality to the interior of your car.Look for ceramic cup coasters online.  Stock your car with a small cleaning kit that has cleaning solution and a clean sponge or cloth. This way, in the event of a spill, you can clean it up right away and prevent a buildup of gunk in the holders. Put the cleaning kit in your glove compartment or in the back pocket of your seat so it’s within reach when you need it.	Buy washable inserts for the holders. Use ceramic cup coasters. Keep cleaning supplies in your car.
You can always try planting garlic you bought from the grocery store, but you'll have a much higher chance of having a successful crop if you buy garlic cloves, or seeds, from a plant nursery that stocks varieties that grow well in your area. Shop online for a wider selection of garlic and choose one to your liking. Some strains are stronger, some are hardy during cold temperatures, and so on.   The garlic stocked in grocery stores is often shipped in from faraway places, so it won't necessary be a strain that works with your climate and soil type. Garlic sold in grocery stores has usually been treated with chemicals to make it last longer on the shelf. It's harder to grow treated garlic than untreated garlic.; , If you live in a northern area that gets a hard frost, it is recommended that you plant garlic in the fall. Garlic overwinters well, and planting it early will cause the bulbs to be larger and more flavorful than a spring-planted crop.However, if you live in a southern area that doesn't have cold winters, plant your garlic early spring instead.   If you're planting garlic in the fall, plan to plant it 6 - 8 weeks before the ground freezes. If you're planting garlic in the spring, plant it as soon as the ground can be worked in February or March.  Choose a spot with full sun and well-draining soil. Work the soil to a depth of 4 inches using a garden rake or hoe. Enrich the soil with compost to add nutrients that will help the garlic grow strong and healthy.   If you wish, prepare to grow the garlic in a pot. Choose a pot wide and deep enough to hold the garlic you wish to grow, and fill it with rich potting soil.  Divide the bulb into individual cloves, keeping the papery skin intact. Plant the cloves 4 inches apart and about 2 inches deep. Make sure that the flat root side is pointing down and the tapered side is pointing up - otherwise the garlic will grow in the wrong direction. Cover the planted garlic cloves with soil and pat gently.  If you're planting your garlic in the fall, cover the area with 6 inches of straw to protect the garlic during the winter. In the spring, the mulch can be removed. If you're planting your garlic in the spring, be sure to mulch it to retain soil moisture.  You should see the garlic scapes emerge from the ground in early spring. Cut off any flower shoots you see, since if they're left to grow they'll take energy away from the bulb formation and result in smaller bulbs.  Water the garlic every 3 to 5 days throughout the growing season. When you see the soil get dry and dusty, that means it's time to water. Garlic plants don't need to be water during the fall and winter.  If the garlic shoots look yellowish or limp in the middle of the growing season, you can dress the plants with fertilizer to help them perk up. Keep the garlic bed weeded so that the garlic doesn't have to compete with other plants for nutrients and water., At the end of the growing season, in July or August, the tops of the garlic plants will start looking yellow and begin to fall over and die. This means it's time to harvest the garlic.   Don't harvest the garlic too late in the season - the bulbs will shrivel and the garlic won't be good to eat. Garlic harvested too early won't cure properly.  Use a spade to dig around the garlic bulbs without breaking through the cloves. Brush off excess dirt. You can leave the garlic stem attached to the bulb.  Before you use the garlic, it's necessary to let it cure. During this time the skin will dry and the bulb will become firm. Store the harvested garlic in a cool, dry place for curing.   You can cut off the stem and cure the garlic bulbs individually in a storage bin. Make sure they get plenty of air circulation. Another common way to cure and store garlic is to leave the stems attached and braid them, then hang the garlic in a cool, dry place. You can also cure your garlic by hanging the cloves upside down in a warm, shaded area with the leaves attached.  The cloves should be firm to the touch, and easy to pull apart.  Pick out a few large bulbs to plant either in the fall before the ground freezes or in early spring. Choose the best-looking bulbs to ensure that next season's plants are big and flavorful.	Source garlic to plant. Get ready to plant in the fall or the spring. Prepare a planting site. Plant the garlic cloves. Mulch the area heavily. Cut off flower shoots in the spring. Keep the garlic watered. Fertilize and weed as necessary. Harvest when the tops turn yellow and begin to die off. Remove the bulbs from the ground without breaking them. Let the bulbs cure for 2 weeks. Use the garlic when the skin is dry and papery. Save the best bulbs for next season's planting.
The first step for any pilot is to get their Private Pilot Licence. This is considered the first step because it is the basic pilot licence that everyone must get. This licence allows you to fly, but it doesn't allow you to be paid to fly. This licence can be finished in as quickly as 2-3 months, depending on your skill and dedication.; , This is the next licence after the Private Pilot Licence. It allows you to start working as a professional pilot. This licence requires 200-250 hours of flying hours before you are eligible to write the exam. When you get this licence, you will begin working entry level pilot jobs.  This is not a required step to become a professional pilot. However, it is very beneficial for your pilot career if you have a degree. The most important thing for pilots is their licensing and flying experience. However, a university degree will help you stand out from other applicants. As with all careers in the world, the more educated applicant is given preference. In fact, airlines are known to give preference to applicants with a university degree. Remember, that it does not matter what you study, or what kind of degree you have. You do not necessarily have to have an aviation or science degree. The important thing is that you have further education.  This is the highest level of licensing for a pilot. It allows you work as Captain on regional and major airlines. All major pilot jobs require this licence. It will require you a minimum of 1500 hours flying experience to be eligible to write this 2 part written exam. These hours will be built up by working as a pilot after getting your Commercial Pilot Licence.	Get a Private Pilot Licence. Get a Commercial Pilot Licence. Enhance your pilot career with a degree. Advance your level with an Airline Transport Pilot Licence.

Popular software used by professionals, such as Adobe Flash, Photoshop, and Toon Boom Studios, cost hundreds of dollars.Save your money for now and start with a simple app like Animation Creator HD or Animation Desk Cloud, which are easy to use and only cost a few bucks.   Use a tablet if you have one. Drawing directly on a screen is often preferred by artists., Familiarize yourself with the program’s functions and features. Sample the different kinds of brushes it offers. Learn how to duplicate frames, add more layers per frame, and change the rate of frames seen per second.   Practice by animating a stick figure running in place. In the first frame, draw the whole body in a single layer. Add a second frame. With most apps, a new blank frame will appear as a translucent “onion skin” so you can trace the previous frame underneath it. Trace the stick figure’s head and upper torso on the second frame. Next, draw the arms so that one arm rises slightly forward, while the other falls behind. Do the same with the legs. Add a third blank frame. Trace the head and upper body as before and alter the position of each arm and leg again. Continue the process until you’ve created enough frames for your stick figure to run a few strides, then play it back to watch. Practice drawing in layers next. Animate another stick figure running in place, only this time draw the head and upper torso in a single layer. Add a second layer to the first frame to draw the arms. Add a third layer and draw the legs. Then duplicate the first frame so you now have two identical frames. In the second frame, erase the arms in the second layer and draw them in new positions. Do the same with the legs in the third layer. Duplicate the second frame and repeat the process until your stick figure runs a few strides, without you ever having to draw the head and upper torso more than once.  Choose the screen ratio that you prefer for your opening shot. In your first frame, create layers for your foreground, middle-ground, and background respectively.   Depending on your app, you may be able to create even more layers; Animation Creator HD, for instance, offers four layers per frame. Feel free to create multiple middle-grounds.  Think in layers and determine which elements will occupy the foreground, middle-ground(s), and background respectively. Identify which elements will occupy more than one.   Imagine a person seated at a table, facing the camera, with their elbow resting on the table and a can of soda in their hand. To animate them raising the can to their lips for a sip, think of the arm and soda as your foreground, the table and the rest of the character’s body as the middle-ground(s), and the area behind them as the background.  Use a stylus to draw each element in the foreground, middle-ground(s), and background respectively.   Think ahead. Keep in mind which elements will move from frame to frame, possibly revealing details that are currently blocked from view in the first frame. For example, when a character raises their beverage, their raised arm may reveal more of their body.  In the new frame, alter the elements in each layer as dictated by your storyboard.  Play your animation back as you add and alter more and more frames. To slow your animation down, either duplicate each frame without altering any elements, or reduce the number of frames seen per second. To speed it up, add the number of frames seen per second.  Once you’ve finished each shot, export it to your video library. Open a video-editing app (like iMovie) and create a new "movie" to edit. Import your first animated shot from your video library.  Import each one into the editing app. Add them in sequence to your video.  Sync any dialogue, music, and/or sound effects to the video.	Install a cheap animation app. Take your app for a test run. Open a new file in your animation app. Reassess your storyboard. Fill in each layer. Duplicate the frame. Check your progress as you go. Export the file. Repeat this process for each individual shot. Import audio files.
Set the paint can on top of the fabric, near the bottom edge. Trace around the paint can with the fabric marker.   Cut 2 pieces of fabric around the traced line. This will give you 2 circles for the ends of the decorative pillow.      ; , It should be .5 inches (1.27 cm) away from the edge. This is the seam that will connect the tube to the ends.    Clip up to the stitched line, but not through it. The clipped edges will make it easier for you to sew the pillow together in the end.  You can do this by multiplying the diameter of the circle by 3.14 for the circumference. You need this measurement to find out how much fabric to cut for the middle of the bolster pillow.   For example, if the diameter of the circles is 5 inches (12.7 cm), the circumference is 15.7 inches (39.9 cm), or 5 x 3.14.	Fold the fabric in half, right-side facing in. Stitch a row of long stitches around each circle. Clip this edge of each circle of the bolster pillow, .5 inches (1.27 cm) apart, all the way around. Find the circumference of the 2 circles by measuring the diameter.
This technique is great for mermaid parties and easy to make. All you need is beach towels, ribbons, and rubber bands.   Thicker rubber bands will work better for this design. The ribbon needs to be long enough to fit around your future mermaid’s waist., Place the towel, preferably a beach towel, around the mermaid’s waist. The towel should droop down like a long dress. , Tie a ribbon around the mermaid’s waist. Use the same knot you’d use to tie a shoe. You don’t want to suffocate the mermaid, but make sure it doesn’t slip off., Wrap a rubber band around the last foot of the towel. Leave the rubber band in the center of the towel on your last wrap around. This will produce fins out of the last foot of the towel.	Gather your materials. Position the towel. Secure the towel. Create the tail.
This will obviously vary dramatically based on what kind of project you choose to do. Look for correct the tools. The most common tools for DIY projects are glue guns, power tools, hammer, wrench, scissors, Sharpies, cutters, pen and stationery.   Make sure you consider how often you're going to use the tools. That way you can decide between buying a tool, renting it, or even borrowing it from a friend or neighbor. You don't need to buy an upholstery stapler if you're only going to re-cover one chair. You can rent big tools from hardware stores, whereas smaller purchases like glue guns and scissors are a cheaper investment.  It’s always a good idea to have your materials available before you start the project. Once you start having to run out to the home improvement store every twenty minutes you’ll really lose focus on your project. Make a list of the materials that you need and gather them all before you begin. , DIY can make a mess. It's a good idea to have a specific area designated for your project. Large tables or even outdoor patios are good spaces. If you're going to be using paint or glue, or creating sawdust, consider spreading newspaper or trash bags down to collect the waste.  Websites like Wikihow are filled to the brim with detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish basically anything. Instructions are considered a given when it comes to DIY projects. There’s no shame in looking up how to do something if you’re lost. It’s just a matter of taking advantage of the resources that are available to you. Use the bar at the top of the Wikihow website to search for your particular project. Here are just a few ideas:   Make a Pencil Holder with Popsicle Sticks Build a Bench Make a Bud Vase from a PVC Pipe Build a Birdhouse Make a Windmill	Find the right tools. Gather the appropriate materials. Plan a specific crafting area. Look for instructions.
Don't let this turn you away though! It is important to note that many popular classic rock artists, such as The Beatles, Queen and Led Zeppelin, also dabbled in this genre several times. Did you know that Led Zeppelin’s classic track “Stairway To Heaven” is actually a progressive rock song? If you enjoy that song and other lengthy classic rock pieces (such as The Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again" and Dire Strait's "Tunnel Of Love"), there’s a very good chance that you’ll enjoy progressive rock music as well. Also, Pink Floyd, one of the famous bands in music history, are a progressive rock band, though many are not aware of this at first. A basic love of rock music, especially from the 1960s and 1970s, is necessary for one to be able to at first appreciate and go onto enjoy progressive rock. The genre is challenging and requires an open mind.; ,  Progressive Folk – Features elements of folk, blues, country and world music.  Crossover – More accessible, often radio-friendly progressive rock inspired by classic rock and pop.  Psychedelic – Features surreal, psychedelic guitars and keyboards and sci-fi elements.  Eclectic – Bands in this genre play a broad range of progressive styles.  Progressive Metal – A mixture of progressive rock with heavy metal music.  Jazz Fusion – A mixture of progressive rock with jazz music.  Neo-Progressive Rock – More modern and often highly-advanced progressive rock, largely aimed at veteran fans. Remember that the styles do not end there. There’s many more – too many to list, and there are still various styles of progressive rock being developed as they constantly cross over with each other to create newer sounds. It can difficult to categorize some progressive rock bands, so sometimes it’s best to just jump in and see what’s there instead of judging them by their genre.  They're considered the most influential progressive rock group to progressive rock lovers. Becoming a big stadium band by the 1980s and exploring almost every style of progressive rock there is throughout their career, they are a band that is in the hearts of music lovers both inside and outside of the progressive rock world.   To start listening to this timeless band, get hold of their 3-disc compilation "The Platinum Collection" and listen to the three discs in order. The first disc features a lot of their pop music, some of which you may recognize from the radio, but it also contains some progressive rock material, mainly the two-part song "Home By The Sea" which is a highly accessible prog song to get into compared to others. The second disc contains a good mixture of progressive rock and pop music, and this particular disc is great for acquiring a taste in the genre as it’s very accessible and light here, mainly due to the warm vocals of Phil Collins. The third disc is the most challenging – it features just nine tracks from the Peter Gabriel era, with five of them clocking in at eight minutes and over. Start off by listening to the first two discs a few times, and then check out the third disc. It can be overwhelming due to the amount of talent on display and the lengths of the songs, especially on the third one, but don't give up. These songs are very special to many progressive rock fans, and soon you’ll learn to love them. Take note of the fast and complex keyboard solos from virtuoso Tony Banks, Steve Hackett’s usage of melodic guitar to create atmosphere, the intricate drumming from Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford’s clever bass playing and Peter Gabriel’s dark, powerful vocals.  Once you’ve absorbed and enjoyed the music of the three discs, it’s time to listen to their albums.   “Duke” is an excellent place to start album-wise because it features the best mixture of their progressive rock and pop music. "...And Then There Were Three..." is also an accessible and highly recommended progressive rock album. Make sure to check out the essential “A Trick Of The Tail” and “Wind And Wuthering” as these two albums arguably contain their most beloved Collins-era pieces and are both considered almost flawless. If these two albums aren’t your cup of tea at the moment, try some of their later albums, like “Invisible Touch” and “We Can’t Dance”, which are very radio-friendly and easy to listen to, but also show off some of their progressive rock capabilities as well, though they are less obvious. Once you’ve absorbed the Collins-era music, move onto the Gabriel-era albums as well. The five albums in this era (“Trespass”, “Nursery Crime”, “Foxtrot”, “Selling England By The Pound” and “The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway”) are all recommended here, and require multiple listens as there is a lot of complexity on offer. The Genesis discography is full of extra stuff worth checking out as well, including live albums, B-sides and EP tracks and two multi-disc archive collections.  After getting into Genesis, whose albums hopefully should have given you an interest and hunger for more progressive rock music, try out some of other progressive rock groups from the era. This genre is very diverse and there are many different styles and bands to absorb. All of these bands, all hailing from the United Kingdom, are considered the greatest in the genre, and the ones that will help you advance further into the genre thanks to their albums:     Yes – Similar to Genesis, this band is famous for their highly complex guitar and keyboard solos. Their songs are often science fiction-themed and are generally funky, eclectic, nonsensical and a lot of fun. Recommended albums are “Fragile”, “Close To The Edge” and “Going For The One”.   Pink Floyd – The most commercially successful and well-known progressive rock band, Pink Floyd’s music is highly psychedelic and experimental, with multiple elements of world music and science fiction shining through. Recommended albums are “Atom Heart Mother”, “The Dark Side Of The Moon” and “Wish You Were Here”.   Camel – A symphonic/eclectic prog group who are known for their luxurious and soothing guitars, melodic keyboards and proficiency for artful instrumental songs. Recommended albums are “The Snow Goose”, “Moon madness” and “Breathless”.   Gentle Giant – This band’s music is easy to get into and yet still very rewarding. Their songs craft an interesting medieval atmosphere, using brass, strings, percussion and woodwind instruments to great effect, and the slightly shorter lengths of their songs make them palatable for new prog fans. Recommended albums are “Three Friends”, “Octopus” and “Free Hand”.   Jethro Tull – A progressive folk group, whose songs feature a lot of folk and acoustic elements, woodwind incorporated by famous prog bandleader Ian Anderson, and guitar that ranges from bluesy to heavy. Recommended albums are “Aqualung”, “The Minstrel In The Gallery” and “Songs From The Wood”.   The Moody Blues – A crossover group who recorded mostly short and straightforward progressive rock songs that feature classical instrumentation and lyrics that range from poetic to amusing to touching. Another great band for prog newbies, especially those who love the Collins era of Genesis. Recommended albums are “Days Of Future Passed”, “On The Threshold Of A Dream” and “A Question Of Balance”.  Emerson, Lake & Palmer – A more difficult progressive rock band to get into, ELP’s music is largely based around the pianos and organs of keyboardist Keith Emerson, and their songs are often creatively chaotic and humorously over-the-top. Recommended albums are “Emerson, Lake & Palmer”, "Brain Salad Surgery", “Tarkus” and “Trilogy”.   King Crimson – Like ELP, this band may be more difficult to get into, but are considered one of the most important progressive rock bands of all. Their style is mainly eclectic and sometimes jazzy with heavy guitars and a lot of other instruments being thrown into the mix. Like with ELP, their music often gets very chaotic (and sometimes quite scary), so proceed with caution. Recommended albums include “In The Court Of The Crimson King”, “Lizard” and “Larks’ Tongues In Aspic”.  Renaissance – With the angelic vocals of Annie Haslam, this is a symphonic prog band who mix a classical style with folk and world music. Recommended albums are "Prologue", "Ashes Are Burning" and "Scheherazade And Other Stories".  Rush-A more rock-esque band, this Canadian trio has a focus on keyboards and other progressive rock features in a more rock-oriented way(though still progressive). They have some long compositions(Cygnus X-1) and even a concept album(2112). You should listen to " 2112", "Hemispheres" and "Moving Pictures" as their main ones.  Take note of the sections of each of the songs you choose to listen to.   Close your eyes and try to imagine the scenarios that the songs are crafting, the themes being explored and the meanings of the lyrics. Play these songs again and again to really take in what is going on, comparing each song as you do so. And if you can’t get into a certain track, try another. Remember to start with shorter tracks – if you can’t get into the longer songs, some over 20 minutes, don’t worry. These songs will arouse your interest eventually, as once you appreciate the shorter songs, the longer ones will appear more tempting. The longest progressive rock tracks are often the greatest, including songs such as Genesis’s “Supper’s Ready”, Yes’s “Close To The Edge” and Pink Floyd’s “Atom Heart Mother” all of which contain multiple parts with loads of surprises all the way through.  These kinds of albums are a significant part of progressive rock, as they are albums that tell stories and must be listened to from start to finish in order to be fully appreciated and enjoyed. Albums such as Genesis’s “The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway”, Camel’s “The Snow Goose” and The Moody Blues’ “Days Of Future Passed” are excellent examples of classic concept albums of the progressive rock genre, all taking the listener on magical adventures with every track being necessary to the experience.  Progressive rock is a genre which requires mastery of one’s instrument and a large amount of knowledge on song-writing regardless of the style. Progressive rock albums take a long time to write, rehearse and record, and though not all go on to become classics, the most famous progressive rock albums, like Genesis’s “Selling England By The Pound”, Yes’s “Close To The Edge” and Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side Of The Moon” are considered landmarks in recorded music. If you play an instrument, you may want to try playing the genre yourself; it’ll take a while to adapt to a complex style if you are more accustomed to playing simpler songs on your instrument, but it’s well worth knowing how to play progressively.  There are loads of videos of various bands of this genre performing live and most of them will show you how they are able to make their music and project it to their audience. Make sure to note how the band carefully works together to perform their songs, including the broad range of playing techniques, the instruments used and the sense of unity. This can also help you get into styles of prog that you’re struggling with, as it can be interesting to see the passion of the group and the personality they give off.  They're easy to find if you use Google to search for progressive rock websites and forums, or Facebook for prog rock pages and groups. You can also join forums for individual prog bands, as these will almost always feature "other band" sections where you can discuss a wide variety of bands in the progressive rock genre and other genres as well. Here you discuss your progress with progressive rock, review your favorite and least favorite albums, and obtain the thoughts, opinions and band/album recommendations of people who may be experienced with the genre. You will find progressive rock fans to be among the kindest, cleverest and most open-minded people online, and they will more than happy assist you in your journey through prog.   Read up on the histories and discographies of each artist, reviews submitted by users for each album, the lists of the most beloved progressive rock albums of every sub genre and from every country, and any other things you might want to know. With enough effort and interest and discussion with other followers of the genre, soon you will be able to appreciate and explore the genre further.  Don’t feel like you have to bankrupt yourself by buying every album you can find. Recommended bands to explore outside of the golden years of progressive rock (the late 1960s to the late 1970s) include Porcupine Tree (psychedelic prog/progressive metal), Marillion (neo-progressive rock/art rock), Anathema (symphonic prog) and IQ (neo-progressive rock), among many others.

If you find yourself in a situation where your accelerator pedal is stuck, your first reaction may be to panic. Panic can be dangerous to you and the other drivers on the road, so it’s important that you take a dep breath and stay calm.Take deep, controlled breaths to help slow your heart rate. If possible, breath in through your nose and out through your mouth until you feel in control.; , When driving, you usually should maintain a general level of awareness of everything going on around you, but it becomes extremely important if you find yourself with a stuck open throttle. You will need to find a way to get your vehicle off the road without putting yourself or others at any additional risk. This means quickly looking all around you to ensure you are aware of everything going on in your environment.Use your mirrors to identify other cars around so you can find the shortest route to the breakdown lane without risking an accident. Look for pedestrians on the side of the road or in upcoming crosswalks. Consider the type of road you are on. Are there breakdown lanes? Are there guard rails that may prevent you from pulling over right away?  , The issue with your accelerator may be with the pedal assembly. If this is the case, sliding your toe beneath the pedal and lifting it upward may bring your vehicle back to an idle and allow you to safely pull over. Keep your eyes on the road and both hands on the wheel as you attempt to lift the pedal with your right foot.Do not attempt to use your left foot, as you may need to transition to braking quickly. You will be able to do so with your right foot faster if your left hasn’t gotten in the way. If the pedal comes up freely without affecting the RPMs of the vehicle, the gas pedal assembly is not the issue.  If you are going slowly enough, you may be able to overcome the acceleration caused by your open throttle by firmly pressing down on the brake with your right foot. Be careful, your vehicle may respond differently than it normally does under braking as a result of the engine attempting to power the wheels forward.At high speeds, simply pressing the brake likely won’t bring the vehicle to a complete stop. Be aware that some vehicles may pull to the left of right under hard braking. Keep both hands on the wheel as you attempt to stop a slow moving vehicle by applying the brake.  The emergency or parking brake was not actually designed to stop a vehicle in motion, but rather to keep a vehicle from moving once it is stopped. As a result, the brake may fail if you attempt to engage it while moving, and the vehicle is likely to move erratically if you engage it.The emergency brake should only be used to stop a vehicle in an emergency that includes total brake failure. Using the emergency brake can cause you to lose control of the vehicle.  If your vehicle came equipped with a standard transmission, you can easily disengage the driveline of the vehicle from the wheels by pressing down on the clutch with your left foot. The engine is likely to begin revving (increasing its RPMs), so be prepared for it to make quite a bit of noise.With the clutch pedal pressed to the floor, the engine will no longer be powering the wheels. Be sure to look behind you before slowing down dramatically to avoid being struck by an approaching vehicle.  In a vehicle with a standard transmission, shifting in neutral involves pulling the vehicle’s shift lever out of gear while pressing down on the clutch. For automatic vehicles, you will simply need to push forward on the shift lever (or up if the lever is on your console) to take the vehicle out of drive and put it into neutral. You can usually identify neutral by looking for the letter “N” next to your shift lever.Neutral is almost always the gear directly above drive in automatic vehicles. You should not have to push the button on the shift lever to shift from drive to neutral.  If your vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission, all of the gears are in a line. When shifting the vehicle into neutral, be extremely careful not to push the shifter further than you intended. Accidentally shifting into reverse or park could cause significant damage to your transmission and even cause you to lose control of the vehicle.Most newer vehicles will only allow you to shift the vehicle from drive to neutral while moving.  While turning the engine off will stop the vehicle from continuing to accelerate, it can also compromise your ability to steer and apply the brakes. Your power steering is powered by a pulley on your engine and it receives power only when the engine is running. Likewise, in some older vehicles the engine must be running in order to produce vacuum pressure for the brake system to function properly.If you cannot get the vehicle into neutral, you may need to turn off the engine to stop accelerating, but it should be seen as a last resort. If you turn off the engine, be prepared for your steering to become extremely difficult.  Your hazard flashers are a great way to let the drivers around you know that you are having an issue and that they should keep clear of your vehicle. Turn them on by pressing the appropriate button on your dashboard. In most vehicles, your hazard flashers should be marked with an exclamation point (!) in a triangle.You should make sure you know where the hazard flashers button is in your vehicle before encountering an emergency so you don’t have to look for it. If you are unsure where to find yours, look it up in your owner’s manual at some point when you are not driving the vehicle.  Once you have shifted the vehicle in neutral, you will have only the carried over speed from before disengaging the engine to get you to a safe place to stop, so you should do so as quickly and safely as possible. In many situations, simply pulling over to the side of the road will do.If possible, look for a place you can leave the car for a little while, as it will be unfit to drive until it has been repaired. Breakdown lanes, rest stops and parking lots are all better alternatives to the side of the road when available.  Apply the brake with your right foot until the vehicle comes to a complete stop just as you normally would. The disengaged engine is likely spinning a high number of RPMs (Revolutions per Minute) as a result of the stuck accelerator. Turn it off as soon as you’ve come to a complete stop to avoid causing further damage to the engine.Holding an engine at “redline” for an extended period of time can cause significant damage to the vehicle. Redline can be identified by the range of RPMs indicated on your tachometer with a red bar. Your vehicle may have come equipped with an RPM governor that will prevent the engine from being over-revved. If the vehicle’s RPMs are surging and dropping repeatedly, it is likely because of the governor.  In newer model vehicles equipped with a start/stop ignition button, it may not shut off immediately upon pressing the button. The vehicle’s on board computer may think you are still driving because of the gas pedal being engaged. In these vehicles, holding the start/stop ignition button for three seconds should shut down the motor.Vehicles equipped with start/stop ignition buttons are designed to prevent you from accidentally shutting off the vehicle while driving. Holding the button down for three full seconds sends a message to the computer that you want it to override that safety feature.  Once you are safely pulled over and the vehicle is shut off, do not start it again or attempt to drive. The vehicle will need to be towed to a repair facility and repaired before it will be safe to drive again.If law enforcement arrives and asks you to move the vehicle, explain the issue you had to them and they can help get a tow truck to you quickly. Remember that it is illegal in many places to leave an unattended vehicle on the side of public road, particularly if it is in an unsafe place.	Remain calm. Be aware of your surroundings. Attempt to lift the accelerator pedal with your toe. Press firmly on the brake with your right foot. Do not use the emergency or parking brake. Press the clutch in vehicles with a standard transmission. Shift the transmission into neutral. Be careful not to shift the transmission into park or reverse. Turn the engine off only if all else fails. Turn on your hazard flashers. Look for the closest safe place to pull over. Bring the car to a complete stop and turn off the engine. Press and hold the ignition button for three seconds (if equipped). Do not drive the vehicle until it has been repaired.
As stated, some people have issues that may need addressing. A friend who's chronically late on bill payments could use some guidance. A co-worker who's consistently late for meetings may need to work on time management. However, feedback is very different from criticism. When addressing an issue, focus on suggestions you can make to help another person improve. This is more effective than simply criticizing. People tend to respond better to productive statements, offering them feedback and encouragement, over flat-out criticism.Let's return to an earlier example. Your boyfriend always forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month. This leads to unnecessary stress and is starting to affect his credit rating. You may be inclined to say something like, "Why can't you pay more attention to bills?" or "Why don't you just remember when it's due?" This may not be helpful. Your boyfriend already knows he needs to be more conscientious but, for whatever reason, is struggling to do so. Instead, provide feedback rooted in praise that works towards a solution. Say something like, "I love that you're trying to be more responsible. Why don't we get you a big calendar from the Staples downtown? When you phone bill comes, you can write down when it's due." You can also offer to help in any way you can. For example, "I can remind you to write down when the bill's due each month."  , Inefficient communication often results in heavy criticism. If you're not telling someone what you want, that person cannot be expected to know. Make sure to ask for what you want in a direct, respectful manner. This will eliminate the need for criticism down the road.Say your boyfriend always forgets to wash utensils after using them. Instead of letting your anger over this pile up, which could result in your criticizing later, address the problem right away.Be respectful when addressing the problem. Do not say, "Stop putting dirty forks in the sink. It drives me crazy. Just wash them." Instead, try something like, "Can you please work on washing your forks after you use them? I notice our utensils pile up a lot.", Difficult situations do arise in any relationship. If someone hurt your feelings or upset you, this needs to be addressed. Instead of criticizing, express the problem using "I"-statements. "I"-statements are sentences structured in a way to emphasize your personal feelings over external judgement or blame.   An "I"-statement has three parts. It begins with "I feel," after which you immediately state your feeling. Then you explain the actions that lead to that feeling. Finally, you explain why you feel the way you do. For example, say you're upset because your boyfriend has been spending the majority of his weekends with his friends. Do not say, "It's very hurtful that you spend all your time with your friends and don't invite me. I'm left out all the time." Rephrase the above sentiment using an "I"-statement. Say something like, "I feel left out when you go out with your friends and don't invite me because I feel like you don't spend any downtime with me."  , Judgment and criticism go hand-in-hand. If you criticize others too often, you may be shutting out the other person's point of view. Try to step in another's person's shoes before criticizing. Genuinely try to see things from that person's perspective.   Think about the criticism you're about to say. How would you feel to be on the receiving end of that criticism? Even if what you're saying has some truth, are you phrasing it in a way that will go over well? For example, if your boyfriend is consistently late, you may be inclined to say, "You're being incredibly disrespectful to me by always showing up late." Chances are, your boyfriend is not trying to disrespect you and he may feel attacked by criticism phrased in this way. How would you feel to have someone lash out at you like this?Also, try to consider outside factors that affect behavior. Say your best friend has been less social lately. She may not be returning your texts quickly or at all. Is there anything going on in her life that affects her behavior? For example, maybe you know she's stressed at work or school. Maybe she just went through a difficult breakup. This could be affecting her ability or her desire to socialize. Try to understand this and not jump to judgment.  Finally, a good way to cut back on criticism is to look for a solution to issues you're having with others. Criticism should, ideally, be working towards an effective solution to a negative situation. Simply being critical in and of itself is not helpful.Tell someone what you want him or her to change. Let's return to the boyfriend example. Maybe you want your boyfriend to keep better track of time. Tell him ways he can get ready to go faster. Let him know what timeframes you're comfortable with. For example, maybe you strongly prefer to arrive at events slightly early. Let him know this so he makes an effort to be ready to go a little earlier. You should also be willing to compromise. For example, getting to a party 30 minutes before it starts may be a bit much. Maybe you can agree to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early from now on instead.	Give feedback rather than criticism. Ask for what you want directly. Use "I"-statements. Consider the other party's perspective. Look for a mutually beneficial solution to problems.
There are a number of ASE certifications a tech might choose to pursue. Most of these certifications have a specific experience requirement you will need to meet before you are awarded your certification. The most common ASE certification for automotive repair is the G1 exam for Auto Maintenance and Light Repair.There are many more certifications one can pursue after completing their G1 certification. The G1 test requires a minimum of two years of hands on experience. There are series of tests that cover things like collision repair all the way to repairing school buses.; , You will need to find an entry level technician job in order to gain the necessary experience to become ASE certified. Create a professional resume that lays out your experience. If you do not have any automotive experience, list any professional experience you do have when writing your resume.Be sure to include your name and contact information on the resume. Make sure you list your experience and education clearly. Have a friend proofread your resume to help ensure there are no spelling or grammatical errors.  Look online for entry level automotive repair technician jobs on websites like Monster.com and Indeed.com. You may also want to look in the classified sections of your local newspapers.Many jobs will require that you complete an application online. Pay close attention to ensure you don’t miss any questions. Make sure you dress appropriately when you go in for your interviews.  While you can complete the ASE certification exam before you complete the experience requirements, you will not receive the certification until you have worked in the field for at least two years.You do not have to complete all of the required experience at the same location. The experience must be hands on and pertinent to automotive repair.  There are many technical and vocational schools that offer training specifically designed to prepare you to pass the ASE certification exams, but most require a high school diploma or GED certificate in order to enroll.Locate your high school diploma or GED certificate to be able to prove to the school you apply to that you are eligible to enroll. If you do not have a diploma or GED, earn your GED to fulfill the requirements.  You can enroll in online courses that prepare you for the ASE exams, or you can choose to attend a school in person. Often, attending classes in person will provide you with hands on experience that you may not get through your job. Online courses may be easier to attend if there isn’t a local technical school or if your schedule makes attending classes difficult.Consider how you prefer to learn when deciding between attending classes online or in person. Online courses will require more self-discipline, as you won’t be seeing a teacher to hold you accountable for your work.  There are many schools that offer ASE certification programs. The first step toward narrowing the list of schools down is to identify which programs near you or online are accredited. Most schools will provide that information on their webpage, or you can contact the admissions department to ask about accreditation.You can also search for the schools near you on websites like this: http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/  Make a list of the local or online programs you think you may want to apply to.  Once you have a list of the schools you may want to apply to, consider what the cost of attendance will be. Ask your admissions counselor if the school offers financial aid, and make sure to complete and file your FAFSA in order to receive federal student aid.Make sure to consider the cost of any necessary supplies or expenses associated with commuting if you are going to attend classes in person. Consider whether or not your computer can support your online course load, otherwise the cost of a computer will need to be considered as well.  Once you have chosen one or a small number of programs you will like to apply to and can afford to attend, submit your application prior to the school’s designated deadline for the course.The school’s admissions counselors can help ensure you know when the deadlines are and what you need to submit. Make a note of anything you need to find, like your high school diploma, and make sure you locate and submit them prior to the deadlines.  Whether you attend class online or in person, you will need to cover a wide variety of topics in preparation for the ASE test. Be prepared to learn automotive terminology, the various parts of a vehicle, and common repair or maintenance techniques.If you take the courses online, you will likely need to participate in forums or discussions, as well as submitting normal coursework. Online classes will use pictures of different automotive components while some schools you attend in person will have actual vehicles to demonstrate on.  You must first register for the ASE test before you can choose a location and a date to take it. You can register online by going to https://www.ase.com/Tests/ASE-Certification-Tests/Register-Now.aspx and creating a MyASE account.Check on the ASE website for the registration deadline for the current and upcoming season.

Unplug the machine so you can handle it safely. Never work on the interior of a machine while it still has power, or you could be electrocuted or injured by moving parts.  Choose a bucket you can easily lift when filled with water.  An unpowered machine should not allow more water to enter the system. If you want to be extra safe, find the supply hoses leading from the back of the machine, and disconnect them where they meet the plumbing. The supply hose or hoses are smooth, not rippled. Disconnect them by turning each valve so it runs across the pipe, instead of along it.A cold-only supply is grey or blue. If there is a second supply hose for hot water, it is usually red. Both hoses are smooth.  The drain hose is grey and rippled, similar to a vacuum cleaner hose. Detach it on the plumbing end by removing the twist tie, or by unscrewing the hose clamp if present. Ease off the hose, which may be firmly attached. Do not lower the hose or let it fall to the ground.   If there's a kink in the hose, this could be the problem. Straighten the hose, restore water and power, and run a spin cycle to see if the machine drains. If not, shut off water and power again and continue to the next step.  Lots of waste water will flow out quite quickly. When the bucket is mostly full, lift the hose back up and reattach it to its connection again while you empty the bucket. Repeat until no more water leaves the hose.   If you empty the bucket into the same sink that feeds your machine, pour slowly. There's a chance that some water will flow through the open connection to the hoses. When the water flow slows, tilt the bucket forward so you can bring the hose closer to the ground If no water comes out, there is probably a blockage in the hose. Clearing this or replacing the hose may fix your problem.  This next part usually gets messy. Lay a few dirty towels on the floor, against the front of the machine. Tuck them under the machine if possible.   On some machines, a thin baking tray can fit under the gap between the floor and the base of the machine. Use this as well as the towels if possible.  Some machines have a blank plastic cover over this area, while others have a small "door." On a front-loaded machine, either type is usually located on the front of the machine, near the base. Look up instructions for your model, or search for and disconnect it on your own:   Most plastic covers are attached by plastic tabs. These break easily, so work slowly and methodically. Tug repeatedly until each tab unlatches, without using excessive force. Square, door-like ports are sometimes attached by tabs as well, but some have a simple handle. Round plugs often have a retaining screw, which you'll need to remove and set aside. Slowly twist the plug anticlockwise (this may require force). If water seeps out, wait until it's all come out before you remove the plug completely. If necessary, tighten the plug again while you replace the soaked towels.  Once the port is removed, you should see the pump on the other side. Use a crochet needle, a wire with the end bent back, or a similar small item to reach into the pump. Clean out all the lint and any trapped objects you find. Be thorough, as there may be more than one object.   If you did not find any items, turn on your phone light or torch. Shine it into the pump interior, at the pump paddles. Use a long, thin spoon or other object to gently turn the paddles. If the paddles turn, the pump is probably not clogged.  Follow the above instructions in reverse to reattach the port panel, retaining screw (if present), and hose. Restore the water supply and power.  Open the machine door and fill the tumbler with enough water that you can see it above the holes at the bottom. Close the door and put on a spin cycle only. If the water drains, congratulations, you've solved the problem. If it does not, there may be an electrical fault to the pump. This requires a qualified washing machine technician to repair.	Turn off the power to the washing machine. Place a large bucket next to the machine. Shut off the water supply (optional). Detach the drain hose from the water supply (optional). Let the hose drain into the bucket. Tuck towels against the machine. Remove the pump maintenance port. Clean out the pump. Reattach all parts. Test the machine.

; , Drying should be done with little or no heat and enough air circulation to dry them completely from soaked in 2 days. If the boots are only half soaked, it should be OK to dry them in one day. Obviously, someone who soaks a pair every day must rotate two or three pair of boots. This is critical for your feet as well as for the boots. In cold climates where cold feet can be life threatening, it is important to avoid soaked boots whenever possible. Even if boots contain Gore-Tex® Liners, they must be kept dry or your feet will feel wet and cold.  There are several types of products to make boots or bags water repellent and a few that claim to make them waterproof. Some boots have waterproof liners and factory treatments, but even these require maintenance. Consider several types of water-proofers but often the choice is limited by compatibility with what the factory has applied. Silicone treated leather easily accepts more silicone, etc.   Before waterproofing or water repellent is applied, the boot should be clean and dry. Heavy dirt should be scrubbed off with a wet brush. Light deposits can be wiped away with a cloth moistened in water or solvent. Solvent has the advantage of evaporating quickly so you don’t have to wait before applying waterproofing. The oldest way to protect and preserve leather is by applying something incompatible with water to fill the pores, fibers, and spaces in the leather. The ancient Egyptians used Beeswax if they could get it, and even today, it is a premium product. Other fill materials are Goose Grease, Bear Grease, Mink Oil, Neatsfoot Oil (from boiling hooves), Lanolin, Petrolatum (petroleum jelly), silicone oil, mineral oil, or pitch and pine tar. They simply aim to occupy all space in the surface of the leather so that water cannot enter.  Most of these are fluid at room temperature. You apply them to the outer surface but they soon soak in. You must frequently reapply them to maintain the waterproof quality. After a few applications, the liquid has soaked through the leather. Now it fills all the spaces through the entire thickness of the leather, and begins to show up on your socks. The leather gets soft and mushy and can no longer absorb perspiration to keep your feet comfortable.   The alternative is to choose a product that is solid after application. Quality waxes with solvent to aid in application and little or no oil are ideal because they remain fixed in the surface of the leather.  Beeswax provides the maximum waterproof quality and durability for smooth full-grain (top of the skin) leather footwear. Oil or chrome tanned leather accepts wax readily after removal of any factory coating. (Glycerin and Carnauba wax, which are both water-soluble, often are applied for temporary shine and scuff resistance). To remove these temporary coatings a new boot should be washed with a soft brush using residue free detergent or a mild liquid dish washing soap, and allowed to dry completely before applying waterproofing. Beeswax products also protect split, sanded, suede, rough, and recycled leather. These materials need the protection of wax for rugged use, but it will change their appearance. As wax coats the exposed fibers and fills surface gaps, these non-top grain materials become darker and slicker. Needless to say grease, oil, animal fat, and pine pitch products will not be used where appearance or odor is important. Gore-Tex® fabric lined boots should be protected the same as you would treat them if Gore-Tex® was not present. Beeswax does not affect Gore-Tex® and Gore-Tex® does nothing to protect the outer boot from water and other abuse. To benefit from the breath-ability of the Gore-Tex® liners, the inside of the leather must be dry and free of oil, grease, or animal fat so that it can absorb perspiration from the foot. At night, this moisture will evaporate through the Gore-Tex ® and pass out of the boot leaving it dry and comfortable for the next day’s use. The Gore-Tex® liner will hold water away from your foot, but the wax will keep your boot warmer and lighter by preventing water from being absorbed by the outer layer of the boot or leaking into the space between the leather and the liner. When the leather is wet it can add 1½ pounds to a boot. Beeswax gets results from the combination of its ability to remain fixed in the outer layer of the leather and the superior water resistance of Beeswax. Beeswax has a melt point of about 146 degrees Fahrenheit. It is very dry and oil free. Thus once applied it is not only waterproof but also extremely durable. Beeswax provides just enough lubrication to prevent hardening of leather in typical use. It does not soften leather, try Obenauf's leather oil for dry leather.   Grease, oil, animal fat, and many wax formulas are liquid (or at least soft enough to migrate through leather) at wearing and storage temperatures. They should be avoided because they soak away from the surface and migrate through the leather. They require frequent re-applications to maintain effective concentration on the surface. After a time the heel counters and box toes soften. The leather becomes soft and spongy then the product begins to appear on your socks indicating it has soaked all through the leather. Animal fats become rancid, decaying leather and promoting fungal growth until one day the leather is so rotten the eyelets pull out when you lace up your boots. Saturated leather cannot absorb perspiration and loses its insulation value so your foot feels clammy and cold. Silicones offer easy application but less water resistance, durability, and protection than Solid Wax. Silicones resist water two different ways. The first is similar to wax, oil, animal fat, and grease: it simply occupies space in the leather so that water can’t occupy the same space. The second method is by reducing surface tension so that water beads up and does not "wet" it. This is similar to the function of Fluoropolymers but Fluoropolymers - when successful - reduce surface tension further so that even oil and some solvents can’t "wet" it. (This is why fluoropolymer is superior for stain resistance.)  Silicones are usually in solvent systems for water repellent products because water systems (aqueous emulsions of silicone) can’t match the performance of the solvent systems. A variety of solvents will work but there are advantages and disadvantages with each. The non-flammable solvents are bad for the environment. Even the flammable solvents are VOCs but some are more harmful than others are. There is also a wide range of flammability. Mineral spirits dries slowly but is much less dangerous than solvents that dry more quickly. Even the aerosol propellant can make a difference. C02 is non flammable and a few grams will empty a can. Propane Isobutane is extremely flammable and, because it is heavy and cheap, may be used to fill half the can with no value to the consumer. Polymerizing silicones actually form a film that resists washing away much better that simple silicone oils. For heavy-duty applications where repellent effectiveness is more important than appearance, choose a product that is at least 10% silicone by weight. A heavy-duty silicone formula is an excellent choice for split, or sanded leather or leather / fabric, especially if the suede appearance is more important than a long lasting waterproof from wax.   Fluoropolymers are designed and intended for use on textiles for stain protection. They require an absolutely clean surface for adherence and 300 °F (149 °C) heat is used at the mill to orient the molecules for maximum effectiveness. Applied under perfect conditions they work well and last for many washings if washed only in residue-free detergent.  Fluoropolymers are generally superior to silicone for oil and stain repellency but generally, inferior to silicones, waxes, and fill products for water repellency. Factory applied Fluoropolymer treatments on textiles can be restored to full effectiveness by washing with residue-free detergent to remove residue and then Ironing on Steam setting. Fluoropolymers can give inconsistent results depending greatly upon what surface they are applied to. Baking at 300 °F (149 °C) as in textile mill applications is impossible for boots and it is also difficult to keep boots clean enough for maximum repellency. In any case, Fluoropolymers are better left for clothing applications or limited to suede shoes where stain resistance is more important than Heavy Duty waterproofing.   There are some crossover products that use technologies such as aqueous wax or wax fortified with polymer. Some of these can be applied to wet leather. This sounds enticing when you have failed to prepare your boots beforehand and they are now soaking wet. However, you still must dry them after application before they are ready to keep you warm and dry. Unfortunately, emulsified waxes (with or without polymers) are about as ineffective as emulsified silicones. When wax, oil, or silicone is emulsified, a surfactant has been used to make it mix with water. The surfactant residue defeats the repellent by enabling water to mix with it. This quickly defeats the purpose of excluding water. There are many choices for the casual user. A quick dash from the car to the door isn’t likely to test any appropriately applied product. But when you need serious waterproofing nothing is as effective or long lasting as Beeswax.	Immediately remove the boots or bags and wipe them down before starting. Air-dry the items. Waterproof the items.
If you are worried about the fall of civilization or a bombing, your best bet might be to seek shelter underground.This might be a bunker, bomb shelter, or underground shelter. There are many companies that specialize in custom designing and producing these types of shelters.  History has shown that people panic during doomsday-like events like terrorist attacks or bombings.If you want to keep yourself and your family safe, you may want to consider hiding and staying as remote as possible. This type of surviving is often described as “living off the grid,” and is total isolation from society.  If you have to escape familiar surroundings, it is important to know how to find shelter from the elements. This includes:   Knowing your local geography in case you have to camp out. Learn about dangerous elements such as land formations and wild animals. Knowing how to make a quick shelter.Depending on your surroundings, you can use nature around you to build a sufficient shelter like a lean-to, that will help protect your body from the elements.	Go underground. Stay hidden. Protect yourself from the elements.
Use a paper plate or thick paper that is sturdy enough to support the materials you will be adding. A paper plate works best because they are designed to hold food and be supportive, like a hand! , Place the paper plate on a flat surface, facing up as if you were about to put some food on it. Put your hand in the center of the plate, palm facing down and fingers spread out. Trace your whole hand with a pencil.   Make sure you hold your hand steady. Stand up and put pressure on your hand so it is less likely to scoot around on the table. Tape your plate to the table to keep it in place. Make sure your fingers are spaced out 1/2 an inch to 1 inch so you have space to trace them and so they can wiggle once you cut out your hand. Use a pencil so you can erase mistakes and any visible lines that are left once you cut the hand from your plate.  Follow your outline the best you can. Start at the bottom of your fake hand and work your way up towards the thumb, over the fingers, and then back down along the pinkie side of your hand.  For each hand, cut 19 pieces at a length of 1-2 inches. These will help your hand bend and come to life.Cut the ends at a slight angle or straight across, according to your preference.  Hold the straw between your thumb and index finger. Use your scissors to cut a tiny "v" halfway through the middle so they can bend., Use a pencil to mark on each finger of the plate where a joint should be. Study your own hand to judge where to mark. Also mark a line extending about an inch above where your the bottom of your thumb connects with your palm to roughly an inch below where your pinkie connects.  Place three straw pieces on each finger: two between each joint and one between the last joint and your fingertip. Place two on the thumb: one between the two joints and another between the last joint and the thumb's tip. Place five more along the line across the palm.   Keep the straw pieces separated from each other in the fingers and thumb. If you don't have enough room to do the same with the straw pieces in the palm, allow them to touch end to end.  Allow the glue to dry. Let it sit for about thirty minutes.  Secure the string at the tip of each finger with a piece of tape. Thread it through the straws to the wrist. Go about four inches past the wrist before cutting the string to make sure you have enough., Pull gently on each one to make sure each finger works. If they do, pull them all at the same time for full effect!Put a latex glove on it and stuff it with tissues to make a more life-like hand.	Choose material for the hand. Trace your hand on a paper plate. Cut out your fake hand. Cut plastic straws into pieces. Cut a small "v" in the middle of each straw. Mark your joints. Glue your straw pieces to the hand. Pause here. Thread string through the straw pieces in each finger. Test your strings!
Rosin is a mild adhesive that's used in string instrument playing to increase the friction between the hair of the bow and the string. The rosin temporarily "sticks" to the string until its limit of adhesion is reached, and then releases. When a bow is new, or has been rehaired, the initial layer of base rosin may take some time to get in place, depending on the "roughness" of the hair-string (stallion vs. mare, cold vs. warm climate, what the horses ate, etc.) it may take very little time, or quite a bit more time.   Rosin is basically the same substance that you see pitchers use on the pitching mound in a baseball game to increase their grip on the ball. It is generally produced as a refining by-product while distilling turpentine from tree saps (mostly various species of pine) - it's the goo that's left after the spirits have been evaporated off. Contrary to many old beliefs, the hair does not have microscopic hooks that are raised up by rosin. Under a microscope, the hair looks like a swamp reed, with slightly ragged growth rings that themselves don't have enough friction to do any more that just tickle a whisper from a string. However, they do have enough friction to provide a way for the rosin to transfer and hold to the hair. Once there, the rosined hair will begin a succession of "grab and release" catches of the string to cause a somewhat sustained vibration of the string.; , There are also various types of rosins, most notably by color: some are lighter, and some darker. The best rosin is the one that works best under the playing conditions you are presently experiencing, which is why many advanced players carry a variety of rosins with them to meet the needs of varying playing conditions.   As a somewhat general rule, darker rosins tend to be softer, melt at a lower temperature (like in the summer sun), and grip better in colder weather. Very light rosins tend to be just the opposite: harder, work better in warmer weather where a darker rosin might tend to soften and became gooey while playing.  Using new rosin on a bow depends on what instrument you have. You cannot use the same rosin from a cello or a bass on a violin's bow. The result would be a change in tone in your violin playing. If continued, this will render the violin's bow useless. However, it's okay to use a viola's rosin for a violin – or vice versa.	Understand why violinists use rosin. Choose a rosin. Make sure that you are using violin rosin.
The box must be tall enough to cover the entire torso of the intended wearer and about shoulder-wide.  Do not get a box that extends below the knees or past the elbows, as either trait will make it impossible to move around in. Ideally, the box will end just above the hips and at the shoulder line so that the wearer will still have no difficulties moving around. The depth of the box should be no larger than the width, but you may opt for a box with a more shallow depth to make it easier to move around in. At a minimum, the box only needs to be deep enough for the intended wearer to fit into.; ,        Tape up the other sides of the box to prevent the cardboard flaps from coming loose.  The hole for the head will need to be in the center of the top while the holes for the arms will need to be along the sides and toward the top.  Use a box cutter or sharp pair of scissors to cut circles out for the arms and head.       Begin with the head. Either gauge the space needed for the head or measure the diameter of the wearer's head with a ruler or tape measure. Cut the hole for the head as near to the middle of the top as possible.       Slip the box over the wearer before cutting out the arm holes. The exact distance from the top of the box to the top of the arm holes may vary depending on the individual wearing the costume, and so gauging it with the eye after slipping the box on is the best way to determine where the arm holes should go. Usually, this will be about 2-3 inches (5-7.6 cm) below the top of the box, along the sides. Each hole needs to be at least as wide as the widest part of the wearer's arm.  Cover the top and all sides of the box with white spray paint or white acrylic craft paint.   The white paint creates a "blank slate" of sorts, making it easier for the final color to show accurately without being tinted by the color of the cardboard.       Use a non-glossy, matte paint. You need to use a type of paint that other paint will stick to, making matte paint a far better choice than glossy paint.  Use spray paint or craft paint to cover the box with a primary color.  Red is the most classic color for a LEGO brick, but you could also paint the box blue or yellow. Multiple colors are an especially good idea if you have multiple people attending the same function as LEGO bricks. Opt for bright, solid shades, like "fire engine" red.       Both glossy and matte finishes work for this layer of paint, but spray paint is preferable to acrylic craft paint since paint applied by spray tends to be smoother than paint applied with brushes.       You may need multiple coats of paint, but applying the white layer before the color layer should reduce the total number of color coats.       Don't worry about getting paint on the inside of the box as you work. It makes no difference whether the inside of the box remains clean or gets accidentally coated in paint.   The circles should be primed with white paint and painted with the same color as the rest of the box.       A good idea is to save the cardboard bottom you cut out from the box, cut out your circles from that, and paint the circles using the same paint used on the rest of the costume. Additional cardboard may still be needed, though. Use a stencil, cookie cutter, or compass to draw and cut out perfectly round circles.       Instead of using cardboard, you could also use round, shallow food tubs, like the kind holding ice cream or margarine. Paint these using spray paint or craft paint approved for use with plastic.  Use a hot glue gun to secure the cardboard circles onto the front of the box in two columns with three rows each.  The columns and rows should all be evenly aligned, with even spacing between each one.       You may need to use a ruler or tape measure to mark out the two even columns and three even rows. Do this by dividing the width of the box into three even sections and the height into four even sections. Draw light pencil lines marking off each section, and place the center of one circle over each intersection of lines. Erase the lines when done.  Before putting on the LEGO costume, the wearer should slip on a long-sleeve shirt and long pants that closely match the color of the box.   The shades do not need to be the exact same, but they should be similar. For instance, if you painted a bright red LEGO, wear clothes in other bright shades of red.	Get a box. Remove the bottom of a large cardboard box.Use a box cutter or sharp pair of scissors to cut the cardboard away in a smooth, even line. Cut holes for the arms and head. Paint a white undercoat. Paint a color overcoat. Cut out circles of painted cardboard.You will need six even circles, each with a diameter that measures about 1/8 of the box height. Attach the circles to the box. Wear a matching color beneath the box.
If you are on the hunt for furniture and see a yard sale sign, stop by! They may have what you are looking for. Furniture that is sold at yard sales is cheaper than what you could find anywhere else, either because they do not know its worth, or they just want to get rid of it regardless of price.Do not be afraid to haggle. You will often be able to talk the seller into offering you a lower price.; , There are trustworthy thrift store chains like Goodwill, but there are also many smaller local thrift stores that may have what you are looking for.Thrift store inventories change regularly depending on what is donated each day, so make a habit out of stopping by. When you go to browse their inventories, be prepared to haul the item away yourself.  Stores like Habitat for Humanity accept gently used donated furniture and sell it for a fraction of what you could find elsewhere. Salvaged items are used by definition, but some effort has been put into refurbishing them. These pieces typically have a more traditional and rustic aesthetic., There are several sites you can use to sign up for alerts when there is an estate sale in your general vicinity. Estate sales are the ideal place to find matching furniture sets at reduced prices. These furniture items are usually of a higher quality and were taken care of by their previous owners.	Seek out yard sales. Go to thrift stores regularly. Consider salvaged items. Sign up for estate sales.
You may want to shift the transmission briefly through each of its gear settings before putting it in park.       ; , There's usually a lever on the inside of your car that pops the hood, usually near the left hand side of the cockpit. Consult your owner's manual if you are unable to find it.  On many newer cars, the transmission fluid pipe will be labeled; if not, consult your owner's manual for its location.          On a rear-wheel drive vehicle, the dipstick is usually in the rear of the engine, above the valve cover. On a vehicle with front-wheel drive, the dipstick is usually in the front of the engine and is connected to the transaxle, sticking straight up out of the transmission., On most cars, the car must idling in park with the parking brake on and the transmission hot. Wipe the dipstick on a clean rag or paper towel, reinsert it and pull it out again to check the transmission fluid level. The fluid level should be between two marks labeled either "Full" and "Add" or "Hot" and "Cold."          Usually, you should not have to add transmission fluid. If the level is down significantly below the "Add" or "Cold" line, you probably have a system leak and should take the car to your mechanic to have your car inspected for leaks by a technician.  Good automatic transmission fluid is usually red (although sometimes pink or light brown), without bubbles or odor. If any of the following conditions are true, take your car in for servicing.          If the transmission fluid is a discolored brown or smells burnt, the fluid has been overheated and it can no longer protect the transmission as designed. The fluid can be tested further by putting some on a clean paper towel and waiting 30 seconds to see if it spreads. If it does not, the transmission should be serviced, or the transmission itself will suffer serious damage. If the transmission fluid looks milky brown, it has been contaminated by coolant from the radiator through a leak in the automatic transmission fluid cooler. Take the car to your mechanic at once. If the transmission fluid is either foamy or bubbly, there may be too much fluid in the transmission or the wrong transmission fluid has been used.  Add the fluid a little at a time, rechecking the level periodically, until it is at the correct level.          If you've drained the care completely, you will probably need to add between three and four quarts of transmission fluid.Otherwise, check the dipstick regularly to avoid overfilling the fluid pan.  This process allows the newly added transmission fluid to circulate and properly coat each gear, lubricating it. Start with the engine running and the car in park, if possible with the wheels off the ground. Go through First all the way to Third, including Drive, Overdrive, and Reverse gears. When finished, place the vehicle in park and let it idle to warm the fluid.  Inspect the dipstick, as transmission fluid may have lowered from being circulated through the clutch packs, purging any air from the system. Add fluid as needed to bring to the correct level.  Depending on whether you're just giving your transmission fluid a top-up or you're replacing the entire pan with new transmission fluid, you may need to add extra fluid at this point.          If you're simply topping up, you may need to only add only a quart of fluid, or even less. If you've drained the fluid from the pan, removed the pan and replaced the filter, you may need to add anywhere from 4 to 12 quarts, depending on the make and model.  Your car's transmission fluid is now properly set and your car should be humming along.	Park your car on a level surface with the engine running. Raise the hood. Find the automatic transmission fluid pipe. Pull out the transmission fluid dipstick. Check the condition of the transmission fluid. Add transmission fluid, if necessary. Run the car and take it through each gear if possible. Check the dipstick again to determine how much additional fluid you may need to add, if any. Add the necessary amount of fluid to bring it to its proper level. Finished.
Acidic soil can take a long time to really balance out. This can be done by mixing limestone (or garden preparations with limestone in them) in with your soil. Add limestone in fall every year for a few years and you should notice an improvement.  Unfortunately, most of the eastern half of the US has acidic soil. This doesn’t necessarily mean your soil won’t support fruit trees, but it may benefit from amending it with limestone., Sometimes referred to as “alkaline soil,” soil like this is found in much of the central and southwestern US. Add in a soil conditioner to your dirt, like one containing sulfur or gypsum.  Soil conditioners are available at most hardware stores and home centers. Try Sphagnum peat moss as an organic alternative. If you have access to compost materials, apply these regularly to decrease alkalinity. Be sure to take readings as you balance to make sure you don’t make the soil too acidic., It’s very easy to overload the root system of fruit trees. Their roots are sensitive to direct exposure to fertilizer. Never add fertilizer or manure directly to the hole in which you’ll be planting a fruit tree.Fertilize from the top of the soil after the first pruning of the season and as close before budding as possible. If you tree starts budding sooner than expected, you can still fertilize up through June. Late summer and fall will put trees at risk of frost damage., Nitrogen will make your trees grow in a way that will require more pruning but will actually decrease fruit bearing wood. Each tree will have its own unique needs, but most fruit trees require high phosphorus, potash, and iron.	Reduce soil acidity when necessary. Raise the pH of soil that’s too basic. Avoid fertilizing before planting. Use nitrogen light fertilizers for established trees.
You'll need:   White paint Wet light pink paint (not paint cakes) or light pink paint crayons Wet dark pink paint (not paint cakes) or dark pink paint crayons Makeup sponges or large, soft poofy brushes that will give you a similar texture Wet black paint (not paint cakes) or black paint crayons Thin brushes Bunny ears (optional); , When you're painting someone's face, their hair can get in the way. Tying it back also helps stop paint getting stuck in it.   If they have a fringe, keep it back with bobby pins or hair clips.  If they're greasy and dirty, the paint won't go on properly and the dirt will mix with it, changing the colour.   You can wash their face with soap and water, or your can use a towel soaked in warm water, as long as it gets the dirt off and their face isn't left greasy. Make sure you dry their face off completely before painting it, otherwise the water will mix with the paint.  Get your subject to close their eyes and paint white patches over their eyelids and around their eyes.   It's best to use wet paint, not paint cakes, so it looks smooth and blended. Use a makeup sponge or a large, soft, puffy makeup brush to get a smooth texture. Be careful not to get paint into their eyes.    For the nose patch, use the same kind of paint you used in the last step. A makeup pad or puffy brush like the one you used in the last step works best for the nose patch. For the teeth, use a smaller brush or a paint stick. You can also use a watercolour pencil dipped in water, but it won't give you as smooth a texture and it may not be suitable to use on their face.    Use a thin brush or a paint stick. Once again, you can use a wet watercolour pencil, but remember that it might not give you a good texture, and it may not be safe to use on your subject's face.    Use a thin brush, a paint stick or a watercolour pencil dipped in water. You can try making the black outlines jagged so it looks like fur.  This step is optional, but it will make it a lot more obvious that they are a rabbit.  If you want a quick, cheap and easy rabbit costume, dress your subject in white, give them rabbit ears and stick some cotton wool to their bottom to make a fluffy tail.	Get your supplies. Tie back long hair. Wash your subject's face. Paint the white patches on the eyes. Paint the teeth and the nose area with white paint. Once the white paint has dried, outline it with pink. Make the nose pink, then outline everything with black and add whiskers and whisker dots. Give your subject bunny ears and a costume.
The color and style of the buttons is entirely up to you but you might like to consider some of the following ideas:   Choose matching but varying hues. Choose the exact same color; this could be good where you want it stand out against a plain top. Choose a rainbow of colors. Choose different patterns, or even sizes of buttons. Whatever buttons you choose, ensure that they are in excellent condition and will be able to withstand being turned into an often-worn item of jewelry. Older, more fragile buttons may not be ideal for this project.  For alternating colors, choose an even number of buttons. Arrange the buttons in a circle, alternating the colors and check that the look is suitable. You can have an odd number of buttons if the colors are matching.  For this, the button needs to be much larger than the petal buttons, as they will sit around it. You can either match this button to the petals or choose a button in a completely different color, texture or style, as long as you like how it looks.   Place the large central button over the already-made circle of petal buttons. Make sure you can see the petals poking out from around the edges.  Place this one on top of the big button. Do the same for each additional layer you want (obviously, you're limited by how large your central button is). , Using hot glue, glue the petals to the center. Then flip it back over. Use hot glue again, but this time to add the center layers. Now you have a fixed button flower.  Glue it to the back of the flower.  On the side that doesn't open, lather this with hot glue. Place it on the middle of the craft foam circle. Then place a lot of glue on either side of the pin, and on top of the side that doesn't close. Press it in for a few seconds. Then let it dry. If needed, add more glue until the pin sticks.  Enjoy your new button pin.	Choose the buttons. Decide whether you would like to alternate the petal colors or have the same color. Select the center of the button flower. Find a button somewhat smaller than the big button that is being used for the middle. Glue all the buttons together.  , Flip over the big center button. Using craft foam, cut out a circle about the size of the big center button. Open the safety pin. Finished.

All people are different, and judging someone based on their movie collection requires a lot and a little. The point of judging however, is to gain insight into a person's subconscious or to tell you more about them that you may not currently know, or that he/she may not even know about themselves.; , Movies can be given as gifts, be borrowed, or are someone else's--therefore, do not assume that every movie is an indication of what type of person you are dealing with or what their interests/deepest darkest thoughts are.  To judge, you have to know what you are judging. Movies you have never heard of should be filed away in your memory to look up later.  Action, drama, comedy, romance, etc. The larger number usually is a good indication of what the person prefers to purchase or watch in their down time.  If a movie or several strike you as completely out of the ordinary, you can always ask in a casual way. This is when you can determine if the movie was a gift, belongs to someone else, or is loved by another person in the household. Again, don't assume too much and don't state your question as if you already know the answer.  Now, as you read the list-your first thoughts are subconsciously "Have I seen this movie?" Going with that, you can decide whether or not you liked it. If you liked it or loved it, a strong sense of amusement or fondness may occur. Maybe even a slight head nod. If it is one of your all-time favorite movies, you may immediately "forgive" any other movie you deem "unacceptable." The next question to ask if you haven't seen a movie is "Have I heard about it?"...Immediately your next though is "Yes, so and so said it sucked..." If it is a close friend who's opinion you respect and you both generally agree about things, especially all matters intellectual, chances are you will probably think it sucks as well if you saw it. Take note of that and move on.  Judging requires you approach a collection with an open mind, taking into account all the variables mentioned previously. Some movies "overlap" and there is usually a story behind what a person thinks or feels about each and every movie they possess. Note that not everyone can explain why they like some of the movies they own...this is where judgement comes in.  Your judgement is YOUR opinions and thoughts. Judgement of a person based on movies is considered by most, an inaccurate measurable tool, therefore, you may not receive other people's support of your assumptions or thoughts. Save your judgements for a close friend or relative later, not to the person's face or to someone who you think will agree with you but unsure of. You may end up saying something offensive unintentionally.  Judgement does not always have to be negative. If you see a lot of movies you like from a collection and feel you can ask that person about them, you may realize you have a lot in common. Or better yet-realize something else about a movie that you didn't notice before, a scene, character, some history about the actors, etc. Also, if there are movies you are interested in and the conversation/s have been positive for the most part, you may even start by letting the person borrow one of your movies, and you borrow one of theirs. This way you can continue to get to know one another and share new thoughts and insights about topics the movies address.	Understand the person who has the collection. Don't assume you are right. Be familiar with movies. Immediately look for a predominant genre in the collection. Take note of odd balls. Scan and question. Be open minded. Judgement is personal. Have fun!
Automatic transmission fluid (ATF) is the fluid used in vehicles with self-shifting or automatic transmissions. It's typically colored red or green to distinguish it from motor oil and other fluids in the vehicle. On most vehicles, you can check the level with a dipstick, while the engine is running.   Look for the transmission fluid dipstick, which is usually red-handled. It should be labeled clearly and easy to access on most cars, close to the oil dipstick. Dipsticks list a hot and cold reading. If your engine has not been run in about an hour and you do not live in an extremely hot climate refer to the Cold Reading for proper levels. If your levels are low, but the fluid looks clean, you might just top off the system. If the fluid looks discolored or sludgy, you need to change it. If you're at the mileage marker that requires you to change your transmission fluid, you might just elect to change it anyway, even if the fluid looks good.; , Make sure you've got enough room to squeeze under the vehicle and that the jacks are supported securely.          Always park on a flat, even surface when you're working under the car and use support stands, chucks, or other acceptable bracing to ensure safety should a jack fail or the vehicle attempt to roll off ramps.  The pan will be attached to the bottom of the transmission with six to eight bolts, so you'll have to crawl underneath the vehicle to locate it. For front-wheel drive vehicles, the transmission is typically situated left-to-right under the engine bay. For rear-wheeled vehicles, the transmission typically hangs under the center console area, facing front to rear.   Examine the pan. In most vehicles, you'll be able to drain the transmission fluid by removing a drain plug in the center of pan and letting the fluid drain out into a receptacle. On some vehicles, however, you might have to remove the transmission pan entirely. The fluid pan will have multiple smaller bolts around the border to hold the pan to the transmission, which you can unscrew and pull the pan free. If you want to inspect the fluid filter, gaskets, or any other components, you may want to remove the pan anyway to examine the assembly more thoroughly.  To catch the falling transmission fluid, you'll need a pan under the drain bolt big enough to catch it. Inexpensive plastic receptacles are available at most auto shops.   If your transmission lacks a drain plug, draining the fluid is potentially a very messy operation. Because the fluid will drain around the pan (rather than through a drain plug hole), you will need a collection pan at least as wide as the transmission pan itself if you don’t want to make a mess.  To drain the fluid, you'll either unscrew the drain bolt or remove the pan and the fluid will start draining immediately. It's likely that you'll get some fluid on your hands (it's almost impossible to avoid this), but you can make sure that you keep your face and chest out of the way to minimize the spillage. Place the receptacle under it, unscrew the plug, and pull it away and free quickly to get out of the way.          If the transmission pan has a drain plug, remove the plug to drain the fluid into a collection pan. Use a pan that can contain up to ten quarts of transmission fluid, although that much probably will not drain out. If you need to remove the entire transmission fluid pan, unscrew the two upper-most bolts halfway, then unscrew the other bolts all the way. As soon as the last bolt is completely unscrewed, the pan may drop a bit and fluid will begin draining. You may also have to pull it loose using some force.  Most automatic transmission pans have a magnet inside to collect metal shavings that have been produced by worn moving parts. Remove these shavings along with the remaining fluid in the pan. Metal shavings are normal and represent the typical wear and tear of the gears. Any large or odd-shaped chunks however are not normal. Keep these pieces and seek the advice of a certified mechanic to ensure the transmission is not in need of immediate attention.   About 50 percent of the fluid will remain in the transmission when you drain it. To remove all the fluid, including the fluid in the torque converter, you must flush the transmission completely, a process that is usually part of a more comprehensive maintenance routine.  While you're changing the fluid, it's a good idea to inspect and evaluate the status of the filter and gaskets and replace them if necessary. They won't need to be replaced every time, but cracked or leaky filters and gaskets need to be removed and replaced with identical parts, which you can purchase at an auto supply store. To find out which replacements you'll need for your model, visit the store and talk to a technician.   If you do this, or if you elect not to, replace the plug and the pan assembly, tightening with a socket or torque wrench. Don't over tighten the bolts.  Once the pan is back on the vehicle, you can take the car down off the jack stands and replace the transmission fluid with the appropriate variety.There are different kinds of transmission fluid, so you want to make sure to use the kind recommended by the car manufacturer. Check your owner’s manual to add the correct variety of fluid.          On most vehicles, you'll add the transmission fluid through the port from which you removed the dip stick. The new fluid goes directly into this spout, in most cases. You will need to use a funnel. Pour in a little less fluid than drained out so as not to overfill. You can find out the proper amounts in your owner's manual.  Check the fluid level. If the level is low, add more fluid. Repeat until the transmission fluid is at the right level. Avoid overfilling. Some transmissions require the fluid be checked in neutral and others in park. The wrong amount of fluid will be added if not in correct position. The dip stick and owners manual will indicate correct position.  Transmission fluid is harmful for the environment, and it's important that you avoid draining or dumping transmission fluids into the environment. Always wear gloves and wash your skin of any residue immediately after completing the change of fluids.   Most auto parts stores and body shops will have fluid recycling programs that allow you to drop off your motor oils, transmission fluids, and other vehicle fluids that you collect when maintaining your vehicle. Find a drop-off site in your area.	Check the level of transmission fluid first using the dipstick. Lift and support the vehicle with jack stands. Locate the transmission fluid pan. Place a collection pan under the drain hole. Drain the fluid. Examine the fluid that drains out. Evaluate the transmission fluid filter and gaskets. Add new transmission fluid. Start the car and allow it to run for a few minutes. Dispose of the fluid properly.
If the key head was not completely broken off, work the key head back and forth until it fully breaks off from the part of the key that is in the lock. Discard the key head.; , If the lock is rotated into some position between the key insertion and operate positions, use your thumb or a small stiff object to rotate the lock to the insert position.  Remove any loose debris, cloth or paper from the area.  Use a spray dispensing liquid or powder lock lubricant. Use a liberal amount of lubricant by working the spray at all angles in the key way of the lock.  Lock removal tools are readily available at hardware and automobile parts stores. If a tool is not available, use a homemade substitute.   Choose a tool that is narrow enough to slip into the lock key way, which is the straight opening in the lock that extends down from the key opening itself. The tool must have 1 or more hooks on the end to be inserted into the lock.       Choose a tool that has a pointed hook or hooks. The hooks must extend up towards the key so that they can engage the key teeth. The hooks also should be angled back toward the outer lock opening so they can be used to pull the key back without slipping off of the key teeth.  Gently insert this tool into the lock key way. Turn the hook or hooks sideways while inserting the tool so that they do not catch on the teeth of the key during insertion. Gently jiggle the tool as needed to allow complete insertion of the tool.  Turn the tool so that the hook or hooks are facing towards the key. Slowly and gently pull the tool back, jiggling the tool if necessary, to engage one or more of the teeth of the key.  If the key does not begin to come out with the tool, the hook or hooks did not catch the teeth. Should this occur, reinsert the key removal tool and make a second attempt to engage the tool.  When enough of the key has come out of the lock to allow it to be grabbed with fingers or fine pliers, pull the key and the key removal tool out together. Be thoughtful of how you discard the broken key, as a replica can still be made from the pieces.	Remove the key head. Align the lock for key removal. Clear the car lock area for key removal. Lubricate the lock. Select a lock removal tool. Insert the key removal tool. Engage the key removal tool. Pull the key removal tool back towards you slowly and smoothly. Remove the key.
Fence off the area.  Wear long sleeves, gloves, boots, etc.  Do this repeatedly for a matter of days, and bait and/or spray other ants that you see elsewhere.  This is to kill the queen. Then spray/bait any remaining ants that you see elsewhere.  Spray, bait and drown other ants by leading them into a bucket on its side with bait in it, then quickly flip the bucket up and pour water. The water can also be mixed with hot sauce.	Locate the mound. Put on protective clothing. Pour vinegar and baking soda into the fire ant nest hole. Pour a sufficient amount of commercial poison into the hole. Flood the hole with not only water, but vinegar and other substances.
Talk to radio stations in your area about buying air time or any open positions they might have for a radio host for their main programming. Talk to them about the type of show you want to have and ask about their process for new radio show hosts.   Make sure to secure radio time on the same day and time each week or day to help build up a larger listenership of people who can expect to hear your show at a certain time.If you’re looking to be a radio DJ and play music, contact stations that play the type of music you would want to play, i.e. alternative, country, rock, etc. The same goes for spoken audio shows: you will want to reach out to public talk radio stations about your news or documentary style show. If you’re in high school or college, talk to your school’s radio station about hosting your own show and what’s required for you to do so.; , Tape a radio show using whatever equipment you have available and broadcast it online for the potential of having listeners from all over the world. Broadcast a show live online, or make it available through a podcast service.   Podcasts are a very popular off-shoot from live radio broadcast, and a great option if you want to produce a radio show but can’t find a source to broadcast it live. Starting a podcast allows you to pre-record and edit a show before releasing it on the internet.Try free programs like Spreaker, Radionomy, or BlogTalkRadio that can help you to record, edit, and broadcast your own radio show., Create your own independent radio show using equipment available to you. Edit it and submit it to radio show contests for the chance to have it featured on a popular station or outlet, and possibly even secure your own regular broadcast.   Submit your radio show to a local radio station if they’re holding a contest for amateur radio show hosts, or to a larger network of radio stations like iHeartRadio for even more exposure.Find support and the potential for an ongoing podcast series with programs like Radiotopia., Listen to a wide variety of other radio shows of the type that you’re interested in, whether it’s a talk show, documentary style, or music program. Take notice of the elements that other shows have to help guide what you want to do.   Pay attention to the things that another radio show does that keep you engaged and listening. Does the host give fun facts about the music they’re going to play or just played? Are the interviews interesting and easy to follow? Try emulating these elements in your own show. Also take note of the things in a show that make it drag or make you dislike it. Are there too many pauses? Is the host’s voice too monotone or too fast? Think of how you can avoid these things in your own radio show., Think about and write down all the basic information about the radio show you want to create. Decide on the following key elements of your show:   Name: Consider carefully the name you choose for your show, as it is the only thing that will stay the same in your broadcast. Objective: What do want to accomplish with your show? Is it to inform (informational programs, documentaries), to entertain (musical shows, radio theatre), to do a public service (interviews, reviews, special programs), etc.? Theme: What will you talk about? Decide on a theme or category for the type of content you produce.Schedule: Decide on a length of time for each broadcast, how often it will air, and for how many weeks or months. Of course, this will be decided by a radio station if you broadcast through one. Audience: Who’s listening? Consider what age group, location, and other demographic categories you are hoping to have as key listeners. Show elements: What are the features of your broadcast? Are there interviews? Music? Live callers? Special guests? Advertising: If you need or want advertising to support your radio show, you’ll need to seek out sponsors, record advertisements, and decide how and when they’ll be placed within your show.  Select the songs you’ll play during a radio show that features music selections. Create a playlist or upload songs so that they’re ready to play during a live broadcast or to combine with spoken recordings for a pre-recorded show.   In general, choose the highest quality studio recording of a song, unless you specify that you’ll be playing a live or unusual version. Remember to find the “clean” edits of songs that omit curse words if you’re broadcasting on live traditional radio. If taping a show that you will edit and put online, you should also record and prepare “wraps,” which are the spoken segments that introduce or recap the music played. You’ll want to edit the music files slightly, with fades or seconds of silence, so the wraps fit in more seamlessly., Plan for an informative, educational, or entertainment radio show that uses primarily spoken audio. Arrange interviews, narration, investigative research, and any other elements necessary to put together a complete story or theme.   Conduct quality interviews by maintaining a casual, conversational style and asking your subject further questions to get more information or simply to find a piece of tape that is memorable or noteworthy for your overall story.Note that if you’re conducting a live interview, as in one with someone live in the studio or calling in over the phone, you should do a pre-interview. This allows you to pose all the questions you will ask in the real interview so your subject is prepared for them and you know how they will answer. Write out an outline for the entire “story” you’re trying to build to make it easier to get the interviews you need, information you want, and “scenes” you’d like to create., Write down what you will say during your show, whether it is narration to tell an overall story, questions to ask an interview subject, or wrap portions between songs in a set. Lay out a basic outline, or a more detailed word-for-word script.   Even if your show’s dialogue is meant to be spontaneous or improvised, you should still jot down a general guideline for what to say, points to discuss if you draw a blank, and general lengths for each segment so you don’t talk too much and run over your time. If you’re hoping to have spontaneous dialogue or fill more time, consider having a co-host or accepting live callers. A co-host you can get along with provides easy banter and contributions so the pressure isn’t all on you, and live callers provide an element of unexpected content., Get a full tour and tutorial of equipment you’ll use for broadcasting your show through a local studio. Learn all of the functions of the technology you’ll use (like microphones, speakers, sound mixers, etc.) during live broadcasts so you feel confident operating them on the air.Ask if you can “shadow” another radio show host to get a better feel for how equipment, signals, and procedures go during a real broadcast to learn each step as they go. Or ask if you can do several “dry runs” or demos before going live yourself. This sort of training is typically required by stations anyway. Make sure you understand how to troubleshoot or solve problems with the equipment you use. Though there may be a technician around to assist you if something goes wrong during a broadcast, it’s always best to know how you can address the issue yourself to fix it right away.  Speak slowly and carefully on the radio so that listeners aren’t guessing at what you say or having to adjust their volume. Remember to follow guidelines for appropriate language on the radio, and consider what’s appropriate content for your target audience.   Consult the FCC’s guidelines and your station’s own rules for what words are prohibited live on air. This should also inform what song lyrics you need to edit or not use if playing music. Note that while your intended audience may be adults commuting to work during your morning show, you may have listening children at that hour as well, for whom adult themes wouldn’t be appropriate. The FCC prohibits obscene content on the radio from 6 am to 10 pm.If something goes wrong, like a live caller who’s using inappropriate language or topics, know the procedures in place with your studio and equipment on how to take yourself or a caller off the air and start playing music or another segment.  Make sure to repeat the basic information about the radio station you’re broadcasting from, as well as your name and/or the name of your show. Remember that listeners could tune in at any time during your show segment, and want to identify what they’re listening to.   A radio call sign is the string of four letters that designates the unique transmitting station. The frequency is the number that listeners dial on their radio to get the station’s broadcast. Usually both of these are used to announce and market the station. Consult the staff at your station for their guidelines on how often you should be reiterating the station’s information, as is may vary by station or show. In general, you should introduce the station and your show’s name at the beginning of every wrap portion between music or advertising. Even if you have a pre-recorded show or podcast, you may want to repeat your show’s name after any advertisements you may have included. While you aren’t “marketing” your show or a station as you would with live radio, you can still get the name of your show out there to help get more listeners talking about it on social media, blogs, etc.  Record the audio for your independent radio show, including any narration, wrap portions, sound clips, or interviews you might include in your show. Use any recording equipment you have available to you, or just the built-in microphone in your computer or phone.   If you’re using external equipment, just make sure you can easily sync your recorded material with your computer or whatever device you’ll use for editing.

If you have the time to do this prior to venturing out into the dark, icy world, your fingers (and patience) will thank you. On the road, this process can take longer than you think.       ; , Try to get the chain hanging over the top three-quarters of the tire, making sure that the chains running from side-to-side are straight.          Some types of snow chains will have rings fastened to the chains. These rings belong on the inside of the tire, and should rest on the bottom of the tire, near the ground, during installation.This will require you to get under your car in order to install, and may require a little tweaking. Tuck the chains under the tire so as you drive over them (the next step), they will be ready for attachment on the rear side.  Put the car in gear, disengage the parking brake, and roll forward slightly. Remember, only a small portion of the tires was unfitted, so you'll only need to drive forward a bit. When you determined that you've gone forward enough to ensure full coverage, park the car and engage the parking brake once more.  Starting from the inner part of the tire (near the tire axle), connect the two hooked edges. Do the same on the outside portion of the tires. Using a closer link, tighten the chain links so that they move as little as possible when you do drive.          If you are using link unit chains, try not to use any chain tightening tools. Traditional chains can be tightened with a link tightening tool. A bungee cord with hook fasteners is a common way to make chains fit even tighter over your tires, especially if the chains don't have built-in tightening cams. These can usually be bought anywhere where snow chains are sold.  If the inner portion of the chain is tight, but the outside is loose, you will need to align them.  Once you've had a bit of experience putting on snow chains, you can start installing chains on rear or front tires simultaneously. Doing this will drastically speed up the process.  Over the course of driving a little, the snow chains will shift a bit and will need to be re-tightened in order to secure the tightest bond.  A lot of people don't know how many tires they should put snow chains on. It is a good idea to install chains on all four tires, regardless of one or two drive axels. This way you have equal braking when stopping and your axel won't slide.          Alternatively, you may want to put chains on on all drive wheels of the car.So if your car has front-wheel drive, put the chains on the two front wheels of the car. If your car is 4WD or AWD, put snow chains on all four wheels of your car.  In order to find out what the right size snow chain is for your particular car, you need to know how large your tire is. Look for a long string of letters and numbers on the outside of your tires. The first number tells you the tire width; the second numbers tells you the tire height ratio (the ratio of the sidewall height to the width); and the third number tells you the diameter of the wheel, usually denoted in inches.You'll need this information when you go shopping for snow chains.          Before buying chains, refer to your owner's manual. There are certain rim-tire combinations on some vehicles that are not compatible with tire chains and can cause damage to the vehicle.  It sounds simple, but it's a mistake a lot of people make. They assume that the chains fit like a glove, and when the time comes to install them out on the roads, they realize that the chains are unusable because the fit is wrong. Don't put yourself up a creek. Do yourself a solid and dry-fit your chains before driving in the snow.  Because the idea behind fastening chains seems so easy, a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that it will take a few minutes and then they'll be on their way. Not so fast. Under conditions that call for chains — wet, snowy, dark — putting on snow chains can take an hour or more. And unless you want to be cold, dirty, and drenched, wear proper rain gear instead of your ski-suit.  If conditions improve, or you come across a sign indicating that snow chains are no longer needed, take off your chains. Don't keep on driving with your chains — it puts a beating on the road, as well as your tires.	Lay the chains out and remove any twists or kinks in the metal. With your car parked, parking brake engaged, and chains straightened, fit the chains over the top of the tire. Drive the car forward slightly to expose the remaining one-fourth of unfitted tire. Connect the chains together. Double-check that the inner and outer connections of the chains are in rough alignment. Repeat the exact same process for the other tire(s) on your vehicle. Drive 1/4 mile (1/2 km) and re-tighten the chains. Know how many tires to install snow chains on. Get the right size snow chain. Don't go out on the roads before testing out the fit on your tires. Give yourself enough time to fit the tires, and come dressed for business. Remove your snow chains as soon as you reach clear road.
Soy, paraffin, and beeswax are the most popular waxes for candle-making. Paraffin wax was traditionally used for candles, but as a petroleum product it may not be the best for the air in your home. Soy wax is easy to find, simple to use, and is a clean vegetable-based wax.   Beeswax candles can actually purify the air, but the wax must be mixed with another oil to lower the melting point so that you can actually burn the candle. To use beeswax, consider blending it with palm oil at a half and half ratio.For a recycled candle project, keep the leftover wax from old candles and combine and use the wax to create new candles.; , You can use almost any mold you like to make a candle, as long as the mold is durable enough to withstand the heat from hot wax. Different molds will give you different candle shapes, so feel free to experiment.Craft stores and candle suppliers will have special candle molds to make free-standing pillar candles, but you can also use clean, empty juice boxes, tins, or milk cartons. Use clean glass jars, mason jars, or old candle jars to make a candle in a jar. Try cookie cutters or baking molds to create special candles, or muffin tins to make votive candles. For candles that stay in the mold, consider using hollowed fruit (such as an intact orange peel or pumpkin bottom), special tins, or sea shells., To make your own candle, you will also need a lead-free wick, double boiler to melt the wax, a thermometer, candle dye if you want a colored candle, and fragrance if you want a scented candle.   Scents and dyes can be purchased from most craft or candle supply stores. Candle dyes come in the form of liquids, blocks, or chips, and scents can either be fragrance or essential oils., Sometimes wax comes in chips, but sometimes it will come in a large block. If your wax is in a block, cut it into one-inch cubes. Place the wax into the top pot of your double boiler. Fill the bottom pot with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the top pot inside the bottom pot and heat the double boiler on medium heat, stirring every few minutes.   Consider using an old pot or a specially designated candle pot for this project that won’t be used for food as well, since the waxes, dyes, and scents may never fully wash out. You can find cheap pots at garage sales or thrift stores, or you can splurge on a special candle-making pot, which has a different handle and a pour spout. For a DIY double boiler, place a large, heat-safe glass bowl on top of a metal saucepan. Fill the saucepan with water and the glass bowl with wax. Two cups (227.5 g) of wax will yield an eight-ounce candle,four cups (455 g) of wax will yield a 16-ounce candle, and six cups of wax (682.5 g) will yield a 24-ounce candle.  While you're waiting for the wax to finish melting, you can prepare the wick by stiffening it with wax, which will make it easier to maneuver when you pour the candle.   When enough candle wax has melted that you can access it easily, hold the wick by the base, dip it into the melted wax to coat it, and pull it out. Straighten the wick and let it dry.Once dry, take the wick and dip the base into the wax to coat it. Press the base of the wick into the bottom center of your candle mold (use a spoon or chopstick if necessary), and hold it there for a few seconds to allow the wax to dry and glue the wick in place.Lay a pencil across the rim of your candle mold and wrap the excess wick around it to keep the wick straight and in place when you pour the candle.  When your wax is fully melted, remove it from the heat and add your dye. If you're using dye chips or a block, cut them into smaller chunks before adding them. To make a multicolored candle, separate the wax into different containers and then add the individual dye colors. Stir well to evenly distribute the dye throughout the wax.   Use a thermometer to keep an eye on the wax temperature, and when it reaches 185 F (85 C), add the fragrance.Add 15 drops of fragrance for an eight-ounce candle, 30 drops for a 16-ounce candle, and 45 drops for a 24-ounce candle., Fill the mold with the wax, but leave a quarter-inch (63 mm) of space between the top of the candle and the top of the mold. To make a multicolored candle, pour your first color, and give it about an hour to dry (you may need to keep your other wax colors warm during this time). After the wax has started to harden, add your next wax color. Repeat until you have poured all the wax.When you’ve poured all your wax, wrap the candle in a towel to stop it from shrinking and cracking., Allow the candle to cure for 24 hours, then remove the pencil and trim the wick to one-half inch (1.3 cm). If you made a candle in a mold that needs to be removed, place the candle in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before removing the candle from the mold., You can purchase thin sheets of wax from a craft store that can be punched or cut into shapes to decorate the surface of a pillar or free-standing candle. Using wax sheets in your desired colors, use a craft punch, cookie cutter, or sharp knife to cut the wax sheet into shapes. To affix the shapes to the candle:Use a heat gun or blow dryer to soften a wax cut-out, then warm the candle in the spot where you want to attach the shape. Press the shape into the outside of the candle, and hold it there for a minute to allow the wax to dry.  This method will work best on a light candle that’s not in a mold, because you are going to use tissue paper to transfer a pattern, image, or decoration directly onto the candle. Choose the image or pattern you want to decorate your candle, and then:Gently tape a piece of white tissue paper to a piece of regular printer paper, and print the pattern onto the tissue paper. Wrap the printed tissue paper around the candle and cut the paper to size. Or, if you're using an image, cut out the shape of the image. Use a non-toxic glue to affix the tissue paper in place around the candle. Wrap the candle in wax paper, and apply heat from a heat gun or blow dryer. As the wax heats up, it will saturate and absorb the tissue paper, leaving only the image or pattern on the paper visible. Remove the wax paper and allow the candle to dry.To use this decorative method on a jar candle, print off your pattern onto tissue paper (of any color), and then use a paint brush to apply liquid craft glue to affix the tissue paper to the outside of the jar.  You can use opaque paint markers and glitter pens to paint a jar candle or directly onto the candle itself. You can experiment with shapes, designs, images, or anything else you desire. Use the paint pen for the major design, and then add points of interest with the glitter pen.For festive ideas, consider painting a tree or ornaments for Christmas, leaves for fall or Thanksgiving, hearts for Valentine’s day, flowers for spring, and snowflakes for winter.  Take a cup (240 g) of Epsom salts and stir in food coloring in your desired color (or leave them white). Start with 10 drops, and add more until you achieve the desired intensity. Lay them out on a plate. Then, dip a paint brush in a non-toxic liquid craft glue and use the glue to paint designs or patterns (or the entire thing) onto the jar or candle. When the glue is still wet, roll the candle or jar in the pile of Epsom salts., Thinly sliced dried fruit and flowers can be glued onto a candle or jar to create a rustic and earthy candle. Use a non-toxic craft glue to affix the flowers or fruits onto the candle or jar. Arrange the flowers any way you like.If you're attaching the flowers directly to the candle, consider dipping the candle in hot, clear wax one last time after the flowers are attached. This will help seal them and keep them in place.	Pick your wax. Choose a mold. Gather your remaining supplies. Cut and melt the wax. Prepare the wick. Dye and scent the wax. Pour the wax into the mold or jar. Finish the candle. Use wax cut-outs. Decorate a candle with a paper transfer. Paint the candles. Create a frosted effect. Decorate a candle or jar with dried fruit and flowers.
Before you do any kind of work or maintenance on your vehicle, it’s important that you first put on the necessary safety gear. Checking for oil leaks means climbing under the vehicle where oil will likely be dripping from above you, so eye protection is absolutely necessary. You may also choose to wear gloves to protect your hands from pinches, scrapes, or the radiant heat of the engine bay.Eye protection such as glasses or goggles are a requirement for this project. Gloves are not mandatory but you may choose to wear them.  Before jacking up the car, pop the hood and disconnect the battery to ensure the engine cannot be started for any reason while you are under the vehicle. Use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the bolt securing the black ground cable to the negative terminal on the battery. The negative terminal can be identified by the letters “NEG” or the negative symbol (-) above the terminal.Remove the ground cable from the negative terminal and tuck it to the side of the battery. You will not need to remove the cable from the positive terminal.  Make sure the car is on solid blacktop or concrete and use a jack to raise the vehicle to a height that allows you to climb or use a creeper to slide under it. With it at the appropriate height, place jack stands under the car in designated jacking points to support the weight of the vehicle.Never just use a jack to support the weight of a vehicle you climb under. If you are unsure of where to place the jack or jack stands, check in your vehicle’s owner’s manual for designated jack points.  Look around the engine from above and below for signs of an oil leak. There may be a small leak that allowed the oil to leak out over time or there may be a more significant leak that happened quickly. Because the oil system is under pressure, a large leak will result in oil being sprayed all over the area of the leak.If you see a small stream of oil running down a surface in the engine bay, follow it up to its highest point to locate the point of the leak. If there is a lot of oil everywhere, the leak is likely substantial.  There are a number of different fluids found in the engine of modern vehicles and it can be difficult to determine which fluid you’ve encountered while looking for leaks. Oil is usually brown or black, while coolant tends to be orange or green and windshield washer fluid is usually blue. However, once mixed with the dirt and grime of your engine bay, the color of the fluid may be difficult to assess. Wipe some of the fluid on a blank sheet of white paper to get a better idea of its color.Make sure the engine is cool before starting this process to avoid being burned by dripping fluids. Look for brown or black fluids when searching for oil leaks.  When looking for oil leaks, you may want to start at the common gasket failure points. Engines are made up of metal components bolted together, but simply bolting two pieces of metal to each other will not create a seal that can withstand the oil pressure in your engine. Because of this, automakers add gaskets at these locations to create a seal. If a gasket becomes compromised, the pressure of the oil will force the oil out the weak point and create a leak. While these common locations can be a good place to start, this is far from an exhaustive list of places you may find an oil leak.Look at where the oil pan bolts to the bottom of the engine block. The pan is the lowest point in the engine and is held in place by a number of bolts. Run your finger along the oil pan to identify where a leak may have started. Check the oil drain plug on your oil pan to ensure it is snug and no oil is leaking from it. Look for signs of oil leaking where the cylinder head meets the block (head gasket) and where the cover bolts to the top of the cylinder head (valve cover). Leaks may also arise where the crankshaft bolts to the crank pulley on the bottom of the engine block.  Once you identify the location of an oil leak, you’ll need to take corrective action to stop the leak from continuing. Locate the leak, then remove the component in place over the failed gasket. Scrape off any remnants of the old gasket before replacing it with a new one and bolting the component back into place. Some gaskets are simple and easy to replace, while others may require the removal of the engine from the vehicle. Assess whether or not the repair is something you are capable of doing, as you may need to have a professional mechanic repair the leak.If you can identify the leak, but lack the tools or expertise to repair it, bring it to a mechanic and let them know what you were able to identify. You can purchase replacement gaskets at your local auto parts store.	Put on the appropriate safety gear. Disconnect the battery. Use a jack to raise your vehicle, then use jack stands to support it. Look for signs of the oil leak. Ensure fluids you locate are oil. Check the common locations for leaks. Replace failed gaskets causing leaks.
It might be gold, silver, or another material that strikes your fashion chord. You will also need jump rings, a clasp, and the tools listed in the "Things You'll Need" section.; , It should not be excessively loose so you keep from snagging it on something. Cut the chain so that you will be able to easily clasp it around your ankle.  You need to carefully consider where the assembly is clasped so that will easily wrap around your ankle and shoe. Perhaps having it in front is easiest.   , If you have some way to secure the anklet, it will help the attachment process proceed more smoothly.  Two, three, or four are popular choices, but follow your head. You will need two jump rings for every strand of chain.   Since pumps are not all the same there is the possibility that your ankle jewelry will not fit every shoe you had hoped to pair with the anklet. It is best to check measurements if you intend to use this on different shoes and aim to maximize the flexibility of the anklet.  Each jump ring should be opposite its partner, but not necessarily 180º apart.   If you attach one end of of each loop chain to the main chain will make it easier to measure.    To keep the strands straight, it may be helpful to mark each strand if you did not already attach them. , Put on your pumps and wrap the chain around your ankle, working the strands around your heel, then engage the clasp.	Get a chain that suits your taste. Measure a length of chain which will fit comfortably around your ankle. Choose a position for the clasp and install the clasp. Attach the jump rings. Decide how many strands you want going around your pumps. Attach the  jump rings in pairs. String each strand around your shoe and then cut it so it will not be so loose that it can snag and trip you. Attach the chains to the  respective jump rings, right and left.  ,   Test the assembly.

Offer to play (for free) at benefits, auctions, fairs, wherever there is a public audience. Keep an eye out for talent shows, too; agents are often looking for a band to represent. This doesn't necessarily ensure publicity and an agent, but it will definitely help.; , Go on their website (if they don't have one, they're usually not even worth their representation) and find information about auditioning for an agent.  You may have to send in a recording or audition tape. You may even perform live at their studio. Check or call about what you need to bring.  Don't sit by the phone waiting. This may be the toughest part. Even if you think they've forgotten about you (they haven't!) wait a few weeks before you call again.	Get your band out in the open. Find a nearby talent agency (Google or your local Yellow Pages). Apply. Be patient.
One should be around the size of a basketball, the other distinctly larger. They can be found in many arts and crafts stores, or bought online.; , This is where they will be joined together, so make the cut as clean as possible.  This has to be done quickly, as hot glue erodes foam, so only put glue on the inside 2/3 of the area, and press the balls together as quickly as possible.  One should be the size and shape of five or so stacked bangles (in fact, you may want to model it after them), and the other should look like half of a small bouncy-ball.  The smaller one should be glued on flat-side down, and as quickly as possible.  This should be big enough to accommodate the top part you recently put together.  Make sure to press it on firmly so it doesn't pop off.  Gaara's gourd is a beige-like color, but painting the gourd gold or bronze would give it a somewhat more realistic look.  Does it need another coat of paint? If not, great. If so, repaint it.  Using a darker color than your base, paint a few cracks and splits going down the sides of the gourd.  If you don't know what they look like, there are tons of websites you can turn to for help, like Google or Live Search. Just type in "Gaara's Gourd".  Gaara has a red sash tied around the middle of his gourd - you could use and old scarf or just a piece of red fabric for this. Congratulations, you're done!	Acquire two foam balls. Cut around 1/6 of foam off the top of both balls. Using a glue gun, stick the flat spaces together. From the leftover foam, cut two circles. Glue together the two pieces of foam you just cut out. Cut a small piece of foam from the top of the gourd. Glue the top piece onto the gourd. Give your gourd a base coat of paint. Once the base coat dries, examine the gourd. Paint on the cracks. Paint on the symbols. Tie on a sash.
The plant does not tolerate frost, so your garden climate should be free of frost, filled with sunshine, and in the tropical temperature zone. Minimum temperatures should not fall below 3ºC to 4ºC overnight.; , The soil should not waterlog. Prepare the soil well, dig a suitable hole, and plant the bush in the ground. Add mulch around if wished; this will aid water retention.  This is especially important during dry seasons as the fruit requires regular watering.  Use an organic (home-made) fertiliser twice yearly.  It shouldn't take much to keep the plant tidy. It grows into a small bushy shrub about 1 to 2 meters (3.3 to 6.6 ft) high. It does not need pruning unless you feel it needs a few dead or loose branches tidied out.	Find a position in full sun. Choose well drained soil. Keep the plant well watered. Keep the plant well fed. Keep tidy.

This will dictate whether you need electric guitar strings, acoustic steel strings, or nylon strings.; , The most common gauge is 10-46. See Ernie Ball Regular Slinky or D'Addario EXL110. These are the most popular electric sets and provide a great starting point.  Your guitar is built for one or the other. String gauge. If you want a thicker tone, choose a heavier (thicker) string gauge. If you want easier string to play, choose a lighter gauge.  You will stay with them if you decide to play classical guitar.  They are a little heavier than regular nylon and take vigorous strumming.  They have a much sharper and louder tone than nylon. thickness varies according to the type of set purchased; medium-light gauge is recommended for beginners. Do not use them on classical or electric guitars!  , They are much easier on the fingers than the regular metal strings. Do not use them on electric guitars because they will not pick up electricity.  They provide brilliance in sound. Select light gauge for finger-style playing, heavy gauge for strumming.  They are usually more brittle than bronze.  They are easier on your fingers than standard metal strings. These strings come for both acoustic and electric guitar.  They are comfortable to the left hand and give a smooth tone when amplified. This string is preferred by many jazz guitarists. Flat-wound strings will provide a more mellow tone than a similar round-wound string, however will be harder to grip with your fingers during bends and fretting due to the smoother surface of the flat wrap wire., Acoustic steel strings( phosphor bronze, 80/20, etc...) have too high a string tension for a classical guitar and can damage it. Nylon strings won't vibrate the top of a steel string guitar enough to produce much sound. Electric guitar strings have a different composition than acoustic guitar strings to help the pickups function properly; specifically they have steel wrapping instead of bronze.  For example a lot of metal bands use drop D/C/B/A tunings or D/C#/B standard tunings. For very low tunings choose a heavy set of guitar strings such as a 11. or 12. gauge set. Similarly if you play slide guitar in drop G tuning you would be better off choosing a set of strings which will have a high enough tension for you to play comfortably using a slide.	Figure out what kind of guitar you have. If you have an electric guitar, the industry standard is nickel wound. If you have an acoustic guitar, determine if it requires steel strings or nylon strings. Nylon strings have a soft, mellow tone and are easy on the fingers. Pick ball-end nylon strings, frequently called "folk nylon," if you want to become a folk guitar player. Get Monel strings if your fingers are strong enough to handle the metal strings. Select silk and steel for finger-style playing. Pick bronze strings for finger picking on a folk guitar. Buy a set of brass strings if you want your tone to be sharp and harsh. Get flat-polished strings if you desire ease of playing. Select flat-wound strings for any electric guitar. Make sure to get the correct type of strings for your guitar. If you are playing using alternate tunings, you may wish to get a set that will retain the same tension in that particular tuning as a set tuned to standard.
Look around the theatre and find an adult in line or one that seems not to be doing anything much.  If they say no at first, be willing to pay them some money; a good amount is around $5 plus the cost of ticket.	Find a good adult. Ask them if they could buy your ticket for you. If they still refuse, find another adult and try again.
Many states require periodic emissions tests to be performed to ensure that your car is running as clean as possible and not contributing to excessive air pollution. There are a lot of complicated numbers associated with the process that are probably not of interest to the average driver and vehicle owner, but you can research the Environmental Protection Agency standards for all vehicles here.   You don't need to know the standards to have your vehicle tested. All you need to do is find a testing location in your area and schedule an appointment. They'll tell you if your vehicle is up to the standards, and help you get it to code if it isn't. You can help avoid problems by keeping up on the maintenance of your engine fluids and filters. You should have your exhaust system checked periodically for any issues that may cause a future failure. If your check engine light comes on, have it serviced quickly to prevent further problems.; , Emissions testing is different for different types of vehicles, and is required for a vehicle to be street-legal in some states, while in others there's no requirement at all. Motorcycles are required to be tested in some areas, but not in others. Check with your local bureau of motor vehicles to make sure your vehicle needs to be tested. The most common exclusions are:   Vehicles manufactured pre-1975 Diesel vehicles manufactured pre-1997 Electric vehicles and hybrids Trailers, Failing the emission test is likely the result of some common performance issues in your vehicle. Learning to anticipate and correct these issues can help you pass the emissions test, once you've got it scheduled. The most common system failures are:    Out-of-spec fuel metering: This could be the result of the CPU, if your vehicle has one, or the fuel injection and carburetor unit.  Worn-out spark plugs: These can cause hydrocarbons to spike during the examination. Just basic maintenance on the engine can sometimes cause emissions to spike.  Vacuum leaks: These can occur because the MAP sensor is dysfunctional, or the hoses are faulty. Your MAF sensor may also have issues with a vacuum leak and turn on the check engine light.  Air-injection and EVAP malfunction: If the air-injection system in the engine malfunctions, it won't be able to control the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions properly.The EVAP system may be venting fuel vapors into the engine when it is not supposed to, causing high hydrocarbons.	Check the emissions standards and procedures in your state. Find your particular vehicle group. Learn the common causes of emission issues.
This guitar is easy to make, and great for young children. It is your classic tissue box guitar. Here's a list of what you will need:   Tissue box 4 rubber bands Scissors Paper towel tube Tape Glue Popsicle sticks, straws, or unsharpened pencil Paint, paper, stickers, etc (for decorating)  , It should come away easily. If it doesn't, cut it out using a pair of scissors.  You can also attach the roll using hot glue. The tube should be aligned with the vertical hole in the box.  You can cover the guitar with paper. You can also paint it using tempera or acrylic paints. Here are some more decorating ideas:   Draw little designs on the guitar using markers, crayons, or glitter glue. Stick down some stickers or foam shapes onto the guitar to make it more colorful. Glue down some large beads near the top of the tub to make the knobs. You will need two to three beads on each side.  Draw a horizontal line of glue above and below the tissue hole. Press a popsicle stick down onto each line of glue. Let the glue dry. The popsicle sticks will lift the rubber bands up a little and make the guitar sound better.   Consider painting or decorating the sticks once the glue dries. You can also use crayons, pencils, or even straws to make the bridge.  If you move ahead to the next steps too soon, your guitar will far apart.  You want to end up with two rubber bands on the left side of the tube, and two rubber bands on the right side of the tube. Position the rubber bands so that they are right over the tissue hole.   Try to use thick and thin rubber bands. Each one will give you a different sound., Experiment with making different sounds. You can even cut a triangle out of a piece of colored cardboard to make the guitar pick.	Gather your supplies. Find an empty tissue box and pull out the clear plastic piece inside the hole. Tape the paper towel roll down to one of the skinny ends of the box. Decorate the guitar. Glue down a popsicle stick above and another below the hole to make the bridge. Allow the paint and glue to dry before moving on. Wrap four large rubber bands around the box lengthwise. Play with your guitar.
radiator) close at hand. This can cause the amplifier to fail because of high temperature.; , This, along with step one prevents any heat related failures.  With its many electrical circuits, moisture will play havoc with an amp. An amplifier cover will come in handy for any outdoor venue under the threat of rain.  A guitar amplifier contains wiring connections and other electrical components that can be jarred loose when dropped. Be sure to treat it with respect.  This will guard against power surges to the various components within the amp. It likewise is a good idea to turn all controls to zero before turning your amp off. Of course, then you are ready for the next time when you turn your amp on.  This allows any tubes a chance to warm up before kicking on the full power to the circuits.  Some amps are equipped with half-power switches that allow one to produce music without running the amp at flat-out wattage, unless full power is needed.  While many guitar amplifiers come with heavy-duty speakers, it is not wise to play a bass through them. The bass should have its own amp.  Factory-produced combo amps are not a problem, but a separate amp head and speaker cabinet setup needs to be matched to factory recommended impedance values.  Not every amplifier uses tubes, but if you own one that does, change out tubes with the same type that the amp was designed to use.  Due to inconsistent electrical power sources, it is often wise to guard against electrical surges that would harm the amp's electrical components.  While an amp often makes a handy seat while playing guitar, it is best not to sit on it or allow anyone else to use it as a chair.	Make sure your amplifier is set up in a space without another heat producing device (e.g. Make sure wherever you set up your amplifier it is well ventilated. Do not allow an amplifier to get wet. Do not drop the amplifier. Before turning on an amp, set all controls to zero. When turning on an amp, set it to standby, if the amp is so equipped. Play through your amplifier at less than full power, if possible. Do not play a bass through your guitar amplifier. Make sure your amplifier matches your speakers. Replace a broken tube with the same model number. Plug your amp into a surge protector. Do not sit on your amplifier.
Before you get started, you’ll want to make sure that there’s no water running to your toilet while you’re examining it or making adjustments. Find the shutoff valve on the wall near the base of the toilet and turn it clockwise to stop the flow of water. Then, flush the toilet to drain the tank.Prior to draining the toilet tank, test for possible leaks by squeezing a few drops of food coloring into the tank and checking back the following morning. If the water in the bowl has changed colors, it means you’ve got a leak. Rotate the shutoff valve until it stops turning to ensure that the water is completely off.; , Lift the lid carefully off the back of the toilet and rest it on a flat, stable surface. You should now have an obstructed view of the inner workings of the toilet. From here, you can start searching for the culprit of a weak flush or low overall water level.The majority of water flow problems can usually be traced to the components located in the tank of the toilet.Be careful not to drop the lid or handle it carelessly, or it could break.  Take stock of each of the individual pieces in the tank. Look carefully for any signs of cracking, chipping, warping or tearing. Gradual wear can eventually lead to leaks and improper filling. When these issues occur, it can cause malfunctions in the toilet’s flushing action.While the toilet tank contains many small parts, your attention should be focused on the two main components: the fill valve and the flush valve. The fill valve is a narrow vertical tube that refills the tank, while the flush valve is an opening at the bottom of the tank fitted with a rubber or plastic flapper on a chain that releases water when the toilet is flushed.Pay particular attention to the condition of the ballcock arm (balloon-like rubber ball on the fill valve that gauges the water level), and the chain on the flush valve.  After identifying the part responsible for the feeble flush, make a note of its exact specifications, then take a trip down to your local home improvement store to purchase a replacement. You can attempt to put in the new part yourself by following a basic instructional guide, or call a plumber, who will have the part you need along with the know-how to install it professionally.Broken and damaged parts should always be replaced as soon as they’re brought to your attention to avoid more extensive repairs later on. Only buy parts that are compatible with the model of toilet you're repairing.	Turn off the water to the toilet. Remove the toilet tank lid. Inspect the toilet’s internal flushing mechanisms. Repair or replace faulty parts.
Stand on the side where traffic is moving in the direction you want to go. Stay on the curb and never put yourself in the path of oncoming cars.   Stand in a spot with good visibility, like at a street corner. The easier it is for a cab driver to see you, the better your chances are of getting a ride.; , Many cities have cabs with lights or signs that indicate if they’re in service or not. Look for a cab with a lit-up sign on the roof -- that usually means it’s open and unoccupied.If you’re having a hard time figuring out which cabs are taken and which are available, ask a local for help. If there’s no one around you, try looking it up online using your phone. Go to the official website for the city you’re in and look for tips on hailing a cab.  Once you've spotted an available cab, step off the curb to make yourself more visible. Don't step out too far into the street, and make sure you look out for oncoming traffic., Be firm and confident so the cab driver knows you want to be picked up. Raise your arm up high to make it more visible to the driver.  Look at them and smile so they know you’re interested in a ride. A cab driver that feels confident you need a ride is more likely to pull over., Politely tell the driver the address of your destination and then get in the backseat. If you’re hailing a cab in a busy area with lots of traffic, hop in the backseat of the cab before you tell your driver your destination so cars aren’t lining up behind you.	Stand to the side of the street. Look for a cab that's unoccupied. Step off the curb. Stick out your arm. Make eye contact with the driver. Talk to the driver after they pull over.
Multiply the length times the width times the depth of the space you need to fill. This will tell you give a cubic size, or volume, of concrete that you need. Next, divide the volume (in cubic feet, meters, etc.) by the package yield of the material you are using. Typically, premixed concrete comes in 20, 40, and 80 pound bags, with the 80 pound bag yielding about 0.6 cubic foot of concrete.; , Place any reinforcing steel, and generally speaking, be ready for your concrete., Here are a few examples of different mixtures commonly available:   3000 PSI (pounds per square inch) compressive strength, gravel, sand, and Portland cement mixture. This is a basic, inexpensive concrete suitable for most repairs, as well as for setting posts and poles. 4000 PSI mixture is for repairing or building structural concrete like sidewalks or driveways, where extra strength will increase the durability of the finished surface. 5000 PSI quick-setting concrete is a very strong mixture with a higher ratio of Portland cement to fine and coarse aggregates, typically used where quick-setting is desirable and higher strength may be needed.  Sand mix contains no gravel or stone (coarse aggregate) and is used for grouting or topping, where a smoother surface is desired. Other mixes include premixed mortars, non-metallic non-shrink grouts and high-strength early (high early) concrete. These are specialty mixes for specific purposes not covered in this article.  See "Things You'll Need" below for a complete list, but these will include your dry concrete mix, clean water, a shovel, and a container for mixing.  Wheelbarrows (as in the pictures) are ideal for mixing small quantities of concrete. Avoid spilling the dry material on finished surfaces or lawn grasses, and keep upwind if possible to avoid breathing dust from this product.  This will act as a reservoir for the water you add. Pour one gallon of water for each 60 pounds of dry mix into the depression. Don't worry about overflow or splashing, because all the container's contents must be mixed completely before the concrete is used.  The Portland cement, the key ingredient in concrete, is introduced to standing water, initiating hydration, not the reverse. Makes mixing with a shovel simpler and easier. Just the action of pouring mix in the water commences the hydration process without lifting a shovel. The trick is how much water per bag to add., The ratio is usually 1 gallon (3.8 L) per 80lb bag. But 1/5th of a 5 gallon (18.9 L). pail is hard to mix with 80lb of Portland cement, aggregate and admixture by hand shovel in a wheelbarrow. In revolving cement mixers, this is easy. With a shovel you end bulldozing through semi-rigid stubborn admixture that doesn't want to move. One way is to start by pouring two gallons in the barrow, dump the first bag in, mix completely into slurry, then add bag number two, assuming physically strong enough to maneuver the resultant weight. If not, pour a half 80lb bag into 1 gallon (3.8 L), mix thoroughly, then add the remainder, mixing thoroughly., Plunging the shovel in the mix atop the water at the barrow's rounded front and paddling backward, scooping cement and carrying it back and dumping in the front to come in contact with water. All the shoveling is to bring the concrete mix in contact with water for the water and cement chemical interaction to do the rest. Repeating the paddling step over and over, as many times as it takes, until every speck of mix contacts water (usually about two to three minutes steady Eddie), as in cannot find any dry mix hiding along the bottom, sides or anywhere. You know it's fully mixed when you can grab a handful that won't keep its form after squeezed into a ball but yet isn't soupy. If forms a ball = too dry. If runs = too much water. The proper mixture for strongest concrete resides between dry and runny and ascertained by experience. The strongest is 0.45 water unit per Portland cement unit., Add additional water until the concrete is as plastic as you want it to be for your project. You should avoid making the concrete too thin, or soupy, as excess water will weaken the finished concrete, and will also allow the aggregates to separate out of the mix.  Concrete hardens through the process of hydration, so continuing to mix the material will insure the reaction will occur completely. , You may want to pat the concrete with your finishing tool to compact the material, removing any voids or air pockets which have formed as you placed it. , Clean and put away your tools, clean up the area, and remove the empty bags when you are finished., ., This is best suited for mortar mixes but works with concrete mixes also. Fill a buck just less than 1/3 with water and add an entire 30kg bag of prepackaged concrete and mix.     description	Figure out how much premixed concrete you will need for your project. Prepare any forms you will need to hold the concrete, and grade and compact the soil or subgrade material. Purchase the premixed product you have chosen to use. Gather the materials you will need to complete your project. Open a bag of your concrete mix and pour it into your mixing container. Make a small depression or hole in the dry material in the center of the container, using a shovel or mixing hoe. Alternatively, when mixing concrete in a wheelbarrow, the water is added first and dry mix introduced after. The water/concrete ratio is determined by the volume of Portland cement in the bag, not bag gross weight. When mixing with the shovel, as funny or odd as may seem, the shovel is paddled through the mix just like canoeing. Stir the material and water, using a shovel or mixing hoe, so all the material is wet. Continue mixing for a minute or two to completely mix the water into the concrete mixture. Place your concrete into your form, smoothing the surface with a shovel or other tool so any additional concrete you need to finish the job can be easily estimated.  , Float your concrete after it is placed and rodded off with a straight-edge or screed board. Finish the concrete according to your own requirements or the requirements of the project design. , Barricade the area around the concrete to prevent passersby from stepping into it (which could ruin your finished project) and allow it to set and cure. The technique to properly cure horizontal poured concrete, so will set over time to maximum strength and integrity, is to prevent the water added and mixed with the concrete in the barrow from evaporating away from the newly poured and troweled slab or other surface. An alternative to mixing with a shovel and wheelbarrow is to mix in a standard five gallon bucked using a mixing drill with a "whip" attachment.
Once again, take the cushions off the couch.Also, tape off any areas you don't want to get spray paint on, using painter's tape. Tape those areas off thoroughly, as spray paint has a tendency to drift.Glue together any major cracks or use a patch. Sand the area down before painting., Create thin layers of spray paint on the paintable areas. Thin layers are very important when it comes to leather. Hold the spray paint well above the area, moving it around slowly to create an even, light layer. Start in an inconspicuous area to test what it looks like., Spray paint can become tacky and peel if you don't let it dry between layers. Make sure the painted area is completely dry before you add the next layer. You may need as many as twenty layers when painting a couch with spray paint., Once the couch has an appearance you like, stop adding layers. Let it dry completely. Leave it to cure for about at least two days, so you know it's completely dry and cured. Use a soft cloth to rub down the painted area so that you remove any paint that didn't get absorbed.	Prepare the couch. Apply the paint. Let it dry between coats. Wipe it off.
You are legally required to do this in many countries, however you should do this even if not legally required to do so. Also ensure that everyone else in the vehicle is wearing their seat belt. Even if you are wearing your seat belt, someone else who is not wearing their seat belt could be thrown into you in a collision and cause death or serious injury.; , In a collision, the airbags will inflate. When airbags inflate, they shoot out so fast that anyone leaning against the dashboard could be thrown backwards and seriously injured or killed.  (The front seat position for child seats is illegal in many places.) Regardless of legality, if possible, rear-facing child seats should always be fitted in the rear of the car.  This is dangerous for the same reasons it is dangerous to lean against the dashboard.  These are extremely dangerous if sent flying in a collision. If you have heavy objects, place them in the trunk or tie them down securely so that they cannot move if impacted.  There may be further collisions.  Switch off your engine first.  The pileup may have involved a vehicle which is carrying dangerous goods. You may not be able to tell this just by looking at vehicles, so assume that it is unsafe to light up.  If it is safe to do this, find ways to warn others; for example, using a warning triangle. This will reduce the likelihood of further collisions.	Wear your seat belt whenever you are driving. Do not lean against the dashboard. Ensure that the airbags are turned on, unless there is a rear-facing child seat fitted in the front passenger seat. Do not lean against the sides of the car if there are side/curtain airbags. Avoid placing heavy objects on the rear seats or parcel shelf. If a pileup occurs, keep your seat belt on at first. Exit the vehicle with caution once you are certain it is unlikely that there will be further collisions. Do not smoke, and do not allow anyone else to smoke. If possible, warn other road users.
Oil comes in different "weights," and different cars require different weights. Check your car's user manual to figure out what kind of oil you need to use, then buy a quart of it from a gas station or convenience store.  You don't pour oil down the same pip where the dipstick is located; instead, unscrew the cap located a few inches away.  If your oil was very low, pour in the entire quart. You can use a funnel if you wish, or just pour it directly from the bottle into the tank.  Go ahead and pull out the dipstick, wipe it with a rag, reinsert it, and check the oil level to make sure the car now has enough oil. It should now come up to the FULL line.  Screw the cap back on tightly, lower the hood and make sure it is firmly closed before starting your engine.	Find out what kind of oil to use. Unscrew the oil cap. Pour in the oil. Check the oil again. Replace the cap and close the hood.
Before doing anything else, stop and sum up yourself as an artist. Now, think about how to translate that to an online profile. Be it the few words, Twitter allows you or an entire page of indulgence that your own website would allow you. Bring out the most salient features of your creativity, your experience, your passion, and your reasons for painting. Make it clear to readers why you are an artist who loves art, produces high quality art, and is a true champion of art. If you're not great with words, find a friend who can help you with this really important aspect of selling online – the establishment of your credibility and reliability.; , Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20 % brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).   Read the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales. If your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.  Get yourself out there as best as you can by advertising yourself. Publish some "example" pieces around the web to show what you can do and to demonstrate your style. Be sure to add a watermark to your digital version to protect your artwork from art thieves.   Spend a little time researching online the ways in which other artists are promoting themselves. What works for them and what doesn't? What do you like about their promotional strategies and what do you want to avoid? This type of research can give you a lot of ideas and also alert you to potential pitfalls for the ways in which you will promote your own artwork. Bookmark the sites of artists selling online that really inspire you, so that you can come back to them regularly to see how they're evolving and succeeding. Seize the power of Twitter and Facebook to increase people's knowledge of you. Tweet updates about your new paintings, your thoughts about art, and news items about art in general. On Facebook, place photos of your artwork, (digitally watermarked), photos of you receiving awards, and information about your art, artwork in general, and perhaps even some critiques of artwork.  Given the hundreds of free blogging websites, you have a lot of choice in keeping a blog. Most importantly, it's extremely useful to keep it updated regularly - this gives people something "pretty to look at", and a story to follow as your reputation increases and your sales story grows. A blog can pick up a lot of hits from search engines if you utilize the keywords feature accurately; use it to your advantage. Be sure to name your blog something simple but memorable – you'll want people to be able to find you with ease.   Read How to start a blog and How to increase website traffic for free for assistance. A good way to test keywords for very little cost is through using an auction site. Play around with the words you use to title your art sales, as well as the words used within the body of the text. Keep changing the words until you find the sweet spot – words that really do seem to attract the most views.  This could be your most effective tool if managed well. For every sale you make, every person who sends you an email that might be interested, get all of their email addresses in digital database ready for mass emailing. At designated intervals (once a month, every other week, whenever you start a new series) send them all nice, grammatically correct, friendly emails, complete with a neatly set-out portfolio of the pictures of your recent work (a PDF can work well for this purpose). This keeps you on the radar of past customers, which is important. And if it's a really wonderful newsletter, you might get lucky and they might send it to all of their friends as well – then even more eyes are seeing your work!   Every thoughtful mailing list includes an opt-out option. Don't be threatened by this; see it as good housekeeping and as retaining the clients who really do want to see your items. You're not online to hassle people who aren't interested!  , Like they say, "a picture's worth a thousand words" and you'll want your impression on potential customers to be good. Show detail, right down to paint strokes and paint type. Be willing to show potential buyers multiple shots of your work under different light, hung on a wall, etc. This may be the only way to alleviate the justifiable fear many people have of buying a work of art that they have never seen in person.   Bear in mind that not everyone has a good internet connection. Balance great photos with ease of downloading time. Talk to a web specialist if you're not sure what to do. For more photography tips of relevance, read How to take better product photographs for free and How to take catalog photos.  Licensing art is a way of proving what belongs to whom. It is a necessary bookkeeping in the arts department and will help you if there is a dispute about originality, ownership, or moral rights.  Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).   If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com. Give serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment. Add prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion. When creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.  An online art business needs to be built up little by little. It's much the same as putting together a company (indeed, you should treat your online art sales as a business) – you will try to make your name known, or at least give people a hint on who you are as an artist, develop your services as you grow, and gain in reputation as time goes on. It may feel like a long time at the beginning but solid and patient foundations will set you up for a good future, as well as maintaining a positive attitude about what you're doing.   Attend as many relevant art shows to show your work as you can. If the shows are juried, display the awards your art has won as part of your profiles or website backgrounds.	Sell yourself first. Join online artist communities. Make yourself public. Blog about your artwork. Create a mailing list. Take good pictures. Be sure to properly license your art. Consider the option of creating your own site. Expect this to be a gradual process and don't expect to sell a lot right away.
When the time signature reads 4/4, each measure has four beats and the quarter note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth four beats, the half note is worth 2 beats, the eighth note is worth ½ beat, and the sixteenth note is worth ¼ beat.   If the measure had four quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2, 3, 4.” If the measure had one quarter note followed by six eighth notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2-&, 3-&, 4-&.” “&” represents a ½ beat.  When the time signature reads 2/2, each measure receives two beats and the half note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth two beats, the quarter note is worth 1/2 beat, the eighth note is worth 1/4 beat, and the sixteenth note is worth 1/8 beat.   If the measure had two half notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2.” If the measure had four quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1-&, 2-&.” “&” represents a 1/2 beat. If the measure had 4 sixteenth notes followed by one half note, you would count the measure as “1-e-&-a, 2.” “e-&-a” represents a ¼ beat.  When the time signature reads 6/8, each measure receives six beats and the eighth note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth four beats, the half note is worth 4 beats, the quarter note is worth 2 beats, and the sixteenth note is worth 1/2 beat.   If the measure had six eighth notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.” If the measure had 3 quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1-2, 3-4, 5-6.”. If the measure had 4 sixteenth notes followed by one half note, you would count the measure as “1-&, 2-&, 3-4-5-6.” “&” represents a ½ beat.	Count in 4/4 time. Count in 2/2 time. Count in 6/8 time.
Turn it to approximately 75%-50% of the total heat it can go to. (depending on how hot your iron can actually get); , Move the straightening iron down it as if you are straightening your hair.  Instead, if a certain area still appears to be wrinkled just straighten the area repeatedly until it becomes straight. If you leave the iron on one section of the ribbon, it may singe the ribbon, spoiling its color.	Plug in your straightening iron. Get your desired ribbon. Do not let the iron stay in one section of the ribbon for a prolonged time. Finished.
They should be the exact same shade of red. It doesn't really matter, but it's best to have them match or be at least as close as possible. Also find red or black shoes. Black shoes work better.; , You can trace plates or lids, or use a compass. If you don't have black poster board, you can use black cardstock or black construction paper. Poster board or cardstock work the best. Also make them different sizes.  Do not use any other kind of glue besides fabric glue. Believe me, it's worth a trip to the craft store!  , It should be thin. Glue a big black pompom on a black pipe cleaner. Make two of these. Attach them to the headband by bending each of the pipe cleaners around the headband. These are the antennas.  If you can't find any, try this: take white cardstock or poster board and cut out two wings from it. Then glue them together. Twist white pipe cleaners together to create arm bands. Then glue the ends of the pipe cleaners the the wings.  the redder the better.  Your kids will always be wanting mommy's costumes and not the store's costumes. Enjoy!	Find a red shirt and pants. Get black poster board and cut out circles from it. Use fabric glue and glue the circles on the shirt and pants. Find a black headband. Next find a pair of old angel wings at a thrift store. Put red blush on their cheeks in little perfect circles. Show off your great costumes to everyone you know!
Place chocks or wood blocks behind rear wheels. Loosen the wheel lug nuts. Slowly raise the front of the vehicle by the axle and support it securely on jack stands. Remove the lug nuts and wheels and set them aside.  Spray the bolts with the penetrating oil and allow them to "soak" if they are difficult to remove.,, Scrub with wire brush and spray with the oil if needed as mentioned above. The picture at right is of the old driver's side link in my Laredo prior to it's removal. As you can see, it was horribly rusted and the bolts hadn't moved for 16 years - I had to use a great deal of penetrating oil and my cheater pipe to get them to break loose., Use the breaker bar and torx bit to hold the bolt in place as you remove the nut. Scrub and spray with oil as needed. Use the hammer to tap the bolt free of the link and axle bracket. If the nut and bolt are in good shape (not stripped out, cracked, overly corroded, or showing other signs of metal fatigue) set aside for re-use during new link installation. If not, replace them with hardware of the same size and tensile strength as the original parts (additional tools may be required if an exact replacement cannot be found - ie larger or "box-end" type wrenches, different size and type sockets, etc...). I re-used the bolts on my Jeep because they were in pretty good shape after cleaning them up., This picture shows the old and new links prior to re-installation. The new link is about an inch shorter than the original and since I don't take my Jeep off-road, the shorter link provides a slightly stiffer ride. If you want to stay true to factory spec on your Jeep take careful measurements of the link shaft length and take them to your parts dealer when ordering your new links., When installing the bushings on the upper shaft of the link you will notice that they either have a small circular lip around the shaft opening or are slightly conical in shape on one face of the bushing. That lip or conical shaping needs to be against the sway bar (lip-side UP on the lower bushing, and lip-side DOWN for the upper bushing). Don't forget your concave washer-retainers. The order of installation is as follows:  Lower retainer washer (cupped side up) Lower bushing (lip side UP) Through the sway bar (not shown) Upper bushing (lip side DOWN) Upper retainer washer (cupped side down) Upper nut  , Bear in mind that the bushings will be under extreme pressure after the nuts are tightened to their correct specifications and the bushings WILL NOT retain their original size.  Secure the upper link nuts to 27 foot (8.2 m) pounds (324 inch pounds) Secure the lower axle through-bolt nut to 70 foot (21.3 m) pounds (840 inch pounds) in 10–20 foot (3.0–6.1 m) pound increments - alternating between sides at each stage. , Exact torque spec is unknown as of the original publication of this article.,,,,	Apply parking brake firmly. Using the ratchet, ratchet extension(s) and 15mm socket, remove the front skid plate and set it aside.You may need to lower or raise the axle some to take pressure off of the lower link bolt, so that you can remove it easily at the appropriate step.  Using the ratchet and 17mm socket, loosen, but do not remove, the upper link nut. Using the ratchet and 18mm socket, remove the lower through-bolt nut connecting the link to the axle.     Old Link & New Link Side by Side (through-bolt nut NOT in picture)  Remove the upper link nut and remove the link and old bushings from the stabilizer/sway bar.     Upper Link Assembly  To install the new links is pretty much a reversal of the removal process, but I suggest that you loosely secure the bolts and nuts at first to give them and the bushings a chance to "seat" properly before tightening to the final torque specs.  Once all the nuts, bolts, and bushings are properly installed and seated, begin the final tightening sequence using the torque wrench.Replace the wheels and lightly tighten the lug nuts. Re-install the front skid plate and tighten the bolts to approximately 40 foot (12.2 m) pounds.Raise the vehicle slightly in order to remove the jack stands.Carefully lower the vehicle and tighten the lug nuts to 100 foot (30.5 m) pounds.After completing ANY repair on the vehicle suspension (and this is no exception), take the vehicle to a repair shop and have the alignment checked and/or adjusted by a properly trained professional.Sit back and take pride in all of your hard work!
The northernmost Messier object is at almost 70 degrees declination, meaning that you have to be north of 20 degrees south latitude. The southernmost is at -35 degrees declination, so you have to be south of 55 degrees north latitude. The best point is around 25 degrees north latitude.; , To see all the objects in one night, you have to pick a night around the spring equinox. Pick a night where there is a new moon if possible, or a thin crescent if not. , Basically, what order you will look at them in, and how long you will spend on each one. You'll want to start with the ones that are only in the sky for a few minutes after the sun has set, and finish with the ones that rise a couple of minutes before the sun.  You'll want somewhere away from cities, and you'll want somewhere elevated, so that objects on the horizon don't block your view. The top of a big hill would be pretty good.  You'll be looking for the objects as soon as the sun sets, so you don't want to be faffing around with your telescope in the dark. Get there early, get set up, then relax until sunset.  That way, you don't have to swivel it around yourself: just enter the next target and let the telescope do the work.  Use a camera that will time and date each photo, so that you have proof that you did it all in one night.	Check your latitude. Find an appropriate time of year. Search for the times that the Messier objects will appear on that night.  , Create an observation plan. Find a dark site. Get to the dark site and get set up before sunset. Get a computerised telescope (optional). Take photos of each object, if desired.
All outfits at country concerts stem from one of these two looks.   Denim is a key component to any country outfit. Jeans can come in different styles and colors. Jean skirts, boyfriend jeans, jean shorts, and jean jackets are all perfect for a country concert. They have a casual look but can still be tweaked to look feminine. Lighter colored jeans work best for day concerts but dark tones work best for nighttime.  Floral prints, flowing fabrics, and ruffly cuts are all feminine choices.   "Sexy" isn't the style at country concerts. Summer dresses, day dress and maxi dresses are all fashionable decisions. Country concerts tend to be more casual than pop concerts. Your dress should be more conservative. Miniskirts really aren't practical or comfortable. , Remember, country style is more geared towards a casual look. Flannel is always in style at a country concert. Looser button ups, camisoles, and tank tops are all great options. Ruffles, lace and bows are all details that work for this type of concert. Wear a denim jacket over a t-shirt or camisole. Denim is very fashionable in a country look , Country looks emphasize cowboy hats and boots. Add a cowboy hat for a playful look. Cowboy boots, or boots in general, are always a popular option. Jewelry should be delicate like studs, charm bracelets, and long natural looking necklaces. Emphasize both comfort and femininity.  Don't wear too much makeup or overdo your hair. A natural look is most fashionable for a country concert. Wear your hair down in loose curls, up in a messy bun or in a single braid. For make-up it's important to be natural and minimal. A pink, glowing blush is a must. Don't wear bright eyeshadow or lipstick. Harsh, bright colors don't really go with the casual vibe of country fashion.	Choose between jeans or a dress. Consider wearing a dress. Choose a light, feminine shirt. Accessorize your outfit. Do your hair and make up to complete the look.
Use a sharp, rounded shovel, and get your friends to help get it going. Make it as deep and wide as your skill level can handle: shoot for three or four feet deep and two feet wide for starters. Plan out the hole’s placement, so it’ll eventually form the area in between your jumps.Don't just throw the dirt anywhere. You’ll need it to form take-off and landing mounds. Getting the ground soft by wetting it down before you dig makes this step easier. Think of how you want the final product to turn out, making sure you leave room for deceleration. If you prefer a loop, map out a circuit track that leads back to the start of the course with a hose, rope, or other long, movable object. Once you’ve decided on the best track, use a shovel to dig it out. Use a backhoe or other heavy-duty digging equipment if you have access.  Use the dirt that you dug out from the jump’s hole to build out the take-off and landing ramps. To make the cores of the ramps, use construction surplus, like broken concrete, cinder blocks, and bricks. Form them into a suitable mound shape and begin to cover them with dirt. Do not use logs, branches, or similar items that will decay and cause your jumps to collapse. Add thick layers of dirt, and pack them in to form a secure, solid mound.   The mounds’ heights varies on your skill level. Don’t bite off more than you can chew: don’t go over two feet in height if you’re a beginner.  If you don’t have another vehicle to do so, use your bike to really pack in the dirt mounds. At a slow speed, roll your front tire up the ramp to make the lip. This also compacts the ramp more, making them more usable and stable.   The landing ramp should always be bigger than the take-off ramp and not as steep as the take-off ramp.  Get the mounds wet and muddy, and pack them in even more. Use your bike wheels again and stamp your feet. After letting the dirt harden in the sun for two or three days, wet and pack them at least once more.It’s important to take time to make sure everything is compacted, otherwise your landing will hurt.  Give the ramp a test, and make changes as necessary. You might find that you need to make the lips on either jumping or landing ends smoother by scraping off dirt. Or, on the other hand, you might find that you need to add more dirt. If so, repeat the process of wet packing the mounds.	Start digging the hole. Build up the dirt mounds. Use your bike tires to roll over the jumps. Wet the mounds and pack them more. Try the ramp out.
The "A" stands should be straight up.  You should try to push the bottoms of each leg about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) into the ground, keeping the top supporting bar parallel to the ground.  Tightly tie the stake and the leg together with strong twine.  These stakes provide your trellis with extra support.  The nails should be spaced evenly about 6 inches (15 centimeters) apart. Do not hammer the nails flat into the bars.  Each clothesline should be about 3 feet (1 meter) in length, and one piece of clothesline should connect two screws on opposing netting bars, parallel to the legs of the "A" stand.   Heavy twine or flexible wire may also be used in place of clothesline.	Stand the trellis frame over your cucumber plot. Firmly press the legs of the trellis into the soil. Drive a 2-foot (61-centimeter) stake into the ground next to one of the legs. Repeat the staking and tying procedure with the other three legs. Hammer 1-inch (2 1/5-centimeter) nails halfway into all four netting bars. Tie clotheslines to each nail to form a net for your cucumbers to climb up.
The number one factor that impacts RV loan approval is credit history. Most lenders will want a credit score of at least 640, but a score of 700 or better is more likely to obtain an approval at the best rate and most favorable terms. If your credit score is below this range, you may have to accept a higher interest rate or less favorable terms. With very low credit, you may not qualify for a loan at all., This is your monthly revolving debt, (mortgage, auto and credit card payments) divided by your monthly gross income. Your gross income is your income from all sources before taxes.   Lenders will also want to see proof of income, which is usually asked for in the form of your tax returns for the past two years.Most RV and marine lenders look for a maximum debt-to-income ratio of approximately 45 percent or less, however some will go as high as 50 percent or more with excellent credit., Each lender has their own formula for determining the amount they will loan on any particular RV. Most lenders will loan somewhere between wholesale and retail, depending on the previous factors listed above. However, some will loan up to the RV's retail value on refinancing.   Research the value of the RV you are buying and look for a good deal. This will help you get a loan because the collateral (the RV) will be worth an amount equal to or greater than the loan value.Again, the better the credit history, the more flexible the lenders are likely to be.  A down payment will not only lower the overall amount of your loan, but will also ensure that you are not upside-down in your loan. Because a new RV may depreciate a full 20 percent in a year, you want to have at least paid off that much of its value in that time. Paying a full 20 percent down payment will help you do that and is standard practice among RV lenders.   If you can't afford the 20 percent, there may be special programs that offer lower down payments, especially for those with great credit. However, if you can't spare the 20 percent, odds are you should wait and buy an RV when you can afford the down payment., Most RV loans are between 5 and 15 years. However, for larger loans, perhaps over $50,000 or $100,000, they are willing to extend the length of your loan. This will lower your overall interest rate and make payments more affordable. However, keep in mind that you will end up paying more interest overall (over the life of the loan).	Have a good credit score. Know your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Determine the loan value of the RV. Make a down payment. Extend the duration of your loan.
A voice therapist will help you strengthen your vocal chords through various exercises and activities. Depending on the severity of the damage, your voice therapist may also help you recover breath control while speaking, as well as regain muscle control around the damaged vocal chord to prevent abnormal tension or to protect your airways while swallowing., Bulk injections are done by your laryngologist. It consists of injecting your damaged vocal chord with collagen, body fat or another approved substance to enlarge the chord. This enables your vocal chords to make closer contact when speaking. This procedure may improve your speech and reduce pain when swallowing and coughing., If voice therapy and/or bulk injections do not improve your situation, then your doctor may suggest surgery. Surgery may consist of structural implants (thyroplasty), the repositioning of your vocal chords, nerve replacement (reinnervation), or a tracheotomy. Discuss the options with your doctor to see which procedure fits your individual situation and needs.Thyroplasty consists of using an implant to reposition your vocal chord. Vocal chord repositioning consists of moving your vocal chords closer together by moving tissue from the outside of your vocal box toward the inside. Reinnervation consists of replacing the damaged vocal chord with a healthy nerve from a different area of your neck. A tracheotomy consists of making an incision in your neck to create an opening to access your windpipe. A tube will be inserted in the opening to allow air to bypass the damaged vocal chords.	Set up an appointment with a voice therapist. Receive a bulk injection. Get surgery.
Some rental car companies will provide you with a discount if you pay for the entire rental up-front, rather than when you pick-up or return the car. This can be especially helpful when the car you’re renting has unlimited mileage, so you know the price you’re paying up-front will not change later., Most car rental agencies have loyalty programs that give points to frequent renters. Signing up for such programs is usually free, and may even provide other advantages (e.g. easier checkin, etc.).Most of these loyalty programs work for any rental you book worldwide, as long as it’s with the same agency. If you rent cars frequently, but don’t always use the same agency, sign-up for more than one loyalty program so you always receive points. Be careful as points can expire, or memberships can become inactive, if you don’t meet certain criteria.  Car rental agencies will charge a lower price per day the longer you rent a car. For example, booking a car for 1 week will be cheaper than if you book it for 6 days. If you’re able to book a car for a longer period of time, you’ll pay less per day.	Agree to pay for your rental early. Join a rental car company’s frequent renter program. Increase your rental time.

Turn it so that the last large circle is turned downwards, and repeat from 12 times more. The large and small circles must be fastened on to one another, as seen in illustration. The fastening of the small circles on to the centre is likewise done from the illustration.	Work first a small circle. Turn the just-completed circle downwards. Turn the work again.
Cupid is a fairly rotund character, so try to make your head as circular as possible.; , This will serve as the body.  Each should end with a circle for the hand (follow the illustration to make the position for the sketched hands).  Finish these with horizontal ovals (again, follow the illustration).   At this point everything should still be in circles and ovals--be patient, soon your cupid will begin to take shape.  Outline the face to make it chubby and add big eyes, a small nose, and a smiling mouth. Draw short hair curling around the edges of his face.  Draw a chubby body over the sketch.

This measure should only be taken if your counter top is already polished. Etching occurs when a substance corrodes your counter, leaving behind a very slight mark on it that often looks like a stain, cup ring, or small blemish.If you can barely feel the scratches in the surface of your counter, a polishing paste may be your best alternative.   Make sure your counter top is completely free of soap or any other cleaning agent you used to clean the scratch. These substances may interact with your polishing paste unfavorably. Follow the directions on your polishing paste. Different brands will require different procedures for you to achieve best results. Generally, you should use a small amount of polishing paste to begin with and apply moderate pressure when polishing. In most cases, you'll only need a little of your granite polishing agent to remove etching., Using a coarse grade sandpaper, steel wool, or buffing paper could result in damage to your granite counter top. As a general rule, to protect your granite, you should start with the most moderate grade available. In this case, you should use a dry piece of #0000 steel wool to buff out your scratch(es).Use moderate pressure when buffing and small, circular motions that centralize around your scratch. After several minutes of buffing, if you still notice no change in the appearance of your scratch, you'll have to make use of other measures. NOTE: more aggressive buffing procedures, using specialty granite sanding tools, can be used to remove your scratch. However, if improperly or inexpertly performed, these methods can result in permanent deformation of your granite.  Buffing can remove the top coating of your granite, which is also called the seal.You can gauge whether or not your counter top needs to be resealed with a simple drip test. Simply...   Sprinkle a few droplets of water on your counter. These should form water beads along the top of its surface. Allow the water to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. If the water has spread or left a dark spot on your counter, it's time to reseal your granite., Your local hardware store should have a counter top sealer suitable for your granite. You should always follow the instructions that come with your sealer, but in most cases, to reseal your countertop you should:   Re-clean the area with a mild soap and water. Your hands may have transferred dirt, oil, or grime back to the counter top. Cleaning again will prevent these from being trapped beneath the seal. Allow the counter to fully dry before sealing. Apply your sealer. In most cases, this will be done with a brush, though your sealer might recommend using a cloth for application. Most sealers only require about 15 minutes before adhering to the surface of your counter. Then you can wipe any excess sealer away with a dry cloth, and buff the area with small circular motions using a microfiber cloth.	Remove etching with polishing paste. Use fine grade steel wool to buff out your scratch. Test the seal of your granite after buffing. Reseal your granite counter top, if necessary.
Use a single hole punch to punch 5 or 6 evenly spaced holes around the edge of a plastic or paper plate. If you use thin paper plates, you may want to stack 2 plates together for added stability.  For the tambourine, you'll need as many jingle bells and twist ties as you have holes. Run the twist tie through the middle of each jingle bell and bend both ends towards each other to prevent the bell from falling off of the tie.  Run the twist tie of each jingle bell through a hole in the edge of the plate. Tie each bell on tightly by twisting the twist tie around itself. You can now play the tambourine by either shaking it or by striking the plate's surface with your palm or fingers.	Punch holes around the edge of a plastic plate. String some twist ties through jingle bells. Affix the jingle bells to the plate.
You’ll need a button press. There are small, simple versions that are available for cheap but these often produce a cheap-looking button. If you want to produce a nice final product and you have a lot of buttons to make (>500, maybe), then a press may be a good idea.   You may also want to get a paper cutter designed for buttons, since this can make the process much faster. places that sell button presses often sell the cutters as well. Make sure to buy a cutter which is for the same size as your button machine.  You will need button casing in the correct size for your machine. Make sure you have the metal or plastic disk, the matching back pin, and the mylar plastic front.  Print the images on regular printer paper. Make sure they are the right size for your buttons. Cut them as evenly and cleanly as you can.  The rounded top should be facing up and the disk should be placed in the side which swings and stops on the right (theoretically, the left hole).  The image should be face up and aligned how you wish it to appear (assuming the holders are in the horizontal position). Cover the image with the clear plastic.  The pin back goes in the other holder. The pin side should be facing down and the coil should be pointing to the right (and aligned horizontally).  Turn the holders so that the pieces with the image are under the press. Press down the handle. The pieces should disappear.  Turn the holders the opposite way so that the pin back is under the press. Press this down.  You’re done! Enjoy your badge!	Get a button machine. Get the button casing. Cut out the images. Place the disk in the press. Place the image on the disk. Place the pin back. Press the image set. Press the pin back. Remove your pin.
Crime films usually center either on the perpetrator or investigator of a crime.   You could consider crime a sub-genre of the action movie.  This is crime comedy. Use movies like Mafia! and Pain & Gain as guidelines.  This is a crime thriller. Movies like Silence Of The Lambs, Heat, and The Call belong to this grim, often terrifying sub-genre.  Film noirs are black and white films that more often than not center around crime. Classic films like The Maltese Falcon and Kiss Me Deadly are categorized as film noirs.   There's more information on this interesting genre down below.  This is, well, a heist film. Movies such as Oceans 11 and Reservoir Dogs are examples of this sub-genre.  These films center around African American urban crime, and movies like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society fit into this category.  These film center around gangs/gangsters, mafia, and the mobs. Scarface, GoodFellas, and The Godfather movies are classified as such.  Mumbai crime films depict crime in India. Laal Rang and Thari fit into this category.   You probably won't see a Mumbai crime film without your knowledge, as it's a much more popular genre in Indian cinema rather than Hollywood.  Does it center around the trials of a detective and his endeavors to solve a mystery? If so, it's most likely a mystery film. Use movies like The Big Sleep and The Thin Man as a guideline.  This is the police procedural. M, The French Connection, and Fargo all go in the sub-genre.  This is a whodunnit movie. Whodunits place you in the shoes of the detective, and give you clues along the way so you have a chance to solve the mystery as well. Use movies like Murder By Death and Gosford Park as a guideline.	Identify crime films. Determine if the movie pokes fun at the tropes of crime films or makes light of it all. Notice if the movie has themes of suspense and surprise. Determine whether the movie is a film noir. Notice if a heist is a major plot point. Notice if the film is a hood film. Evaluate whether the film is a mob film. Understand if the movie is a Mumbai crime film. Notice whether the film is a mystery film. Evaluate whether the movie's about the police and their (realistic) activities. Notice whether the movie, unlike a mystery film, doesn't reveal the criminal to you until the very end.
Sealed beam style headlights were common in older model vehicles. These headlights are entirely self-contained and tend to be three to five inches in diameter. Because these headlights need to be pulled out, start by removing any parts of the vehicle’s exterior trim that surrounds the headlights.You may not need to remove any trim components depending on the application.  In some trucks, you will need to remove all or parts of the grill in order to access the headlight screws and connections. Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle to determine what parts, if any, of the grill you’ll need to remove.If you need to remove the grill, it is usually secured with bolts along the top and a series of clips. You will need to gain access to the screws that hold the headlight in place. Remove anything you need to in order to reach them.  Sealed beam style headlights are commonly held in place by a metal of plastic ring that is secured with multiple screws or bolts. Use the appropriate hand tool (screw driver or wrench) to remove each of these fasteners and set them aside somewhere safe.You will need to reuse the fasteners, so be careful not to lose them. If any of the bolts or screws are severely rusted or damaged, be sure to replace them.  With the ring removed, grip the headlight with your thumbs and fore fingers and pull it toward you, out of the front of the vehicle. Once the headlight slides out, disconnect the wiring going into the back of it.Depending on the vehicle, there may be a wire pigtail with plastic releases you will need to squeeze to release. Inspect the disconnected wiring for damage.  Remove the new light from the package and connect the loose wiring you removed from the previous light. Slide the headlight into place where the old one sat and hold it in place until you can replace the ring that secures it.If the wiring connectors are dirty, spray them with electrical cleaner. You can purchase electrical cleaner from your local auto parts or electronics store.  Place the metal or plastic ring back over the headlight and use the fasteners you saved to secure it into place. Once done, return any pieces of the trim or grill you needed to remove.Start the vehicle to test the headlight. If the headlight does not work, check to ensure the wiring is securely connected and free of damage.	Remove the trim around the headlamp. Remove portions of the grill if necessary. Unscrew the ring that holds the light in place. Pull the headlight out toward you and disconnect the wiring. Connect the new light and slide it into place. Screw the ring back into place.
If the containers you use do not have drainage holes, you should poke one hole into the bottom of the container before proceeding. In the case of plastic seedling trays, this can be done by poking the tip of a pen or large needle into the bottom of each compartment. The hole does not need to be large.  Vermiculite works well, as does a mix of soil and sand or soil and perlite.  If using seedling trays or containers with a diameter of four inches (ten centimeters) or less, only plant one seed per compartment. If using a larger pot, spread several seeds evenly over the soil.  Only use enough soil to just barely cover the seeds, preventing them from blowing away. The seeds should not be buried deeply.  The stones should completely cover the bottom of the tray, and the water should not rise above the level of the stones.  Refresh the water daily to provide the seeds with sufficient water from below.  Use a spray bottle until the surface of the soil feels moist to the touch.  During germination, the soil and its seeds should be kept at a temperature between the range of 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 29 degrees Celsius). Periodically test the soil with a thermometer to monitor the temperature accurately.  This should occur within the first week or two. You should still water the seedlings from below for the first month.  Each seedling should have about six “true leaves” at the time of transplant.	Prepare a plastic seedling tray or small pots. Fill your containers with well-draining growing medium. Scatter the seeds over the growing medium. Cover the seeds with soil. Fill a wide tray or bin with stones and water. Sit the seedling tray on top of the stones. Spray the soil with water from above once every three days. Place the entire structure over a heating pad set to low. Cease above-soil watering once the seeds germinate into seedlings. Transplant the seedlings into more permanent containers.
You can trace a pattern from a book or purchase a plastic shape from a craft store. Try a simple, curved shape for your first hand-turned applique.; , Lay the shiny side face down on the shape and draw onto it with pencil. Cut the shape out of the freezer paper with paper scissors.  Smooth your piece of applique fabric onto the top of the ironing board, with the front of the fabric facing up. Set the freezer paper template on the fabric with the shiny side down.   Iron the freezer paper onto the fabric. The shiny side will lightly adhere to the fabric so that you can cut the fabric out to shape., This is the fabric you will turn under while you sew the applique onto the main piece of fabric.   Use cotton fabric for your first applique. It is thin and easy to hand-turn.  Later on, if you use applique patterns with several pieces, you will want to adhere them with freezer paper, outline them and cut them all at once to ensure your fabric pattern matches up., cotton thread for stitching your applique. Ensure the thread matches the fabric on your applique piece. It does not need to match the fabric underneath.  The best time to applique is when your fabric is still a single layer, before you construct a garment. It will ensure your stitches are hidden in the final product.  Choose the position for your applique motif. Pin through the applique and the freezer paper with applique pins.   Use applique pins every half-inch to inch (1.3 to 2.5cm) to ensure it stays still while you sew. Your freezer paper will serve as a guide while you sew. You will want to turn the fabric under until the fabric is flush with the side of the freezer paper.  Use twice as much thread as the area you want to sew. Loop the end several times at the bottom and double or triple knot it.  Most people hand applique when they are sitting in a chair. You can easily lay your fabric on your lap and turn it with your hands as you make progress.   Use a thimble to reduce the wear on your hands. ,, Place your stitches one-eighth inch (3mm) apart.A slip-stitch is also called a blind stitch because it is hidden in the between two folds of fabric.  Insert it one-eighth inch into the fabric. Pick up just a few threads with your needle as you make a forward stitch and pull the thread through.   When doing hand applique, you aim to insert the needle at the edge of where your freezer paper is, so that the outside fabric is turned in as you stitch.  Use a toothpick or stiletto for turning edges to help turn the fabric outside of the paper under the paper outline., Take your time so that you ensure your allowance is neatly turned under your shape. Make your stitches as close as possible around corners.  Knot the end of the thread and clip it. Pull off your freezer paper.	Choose a shape you want to applique onto another piece of fabric. Trace the design onto a square of freezer paper. Heat up your iron on a medium setting. Draw around the freezer paper shape, leaving a one-fourth inch (0.6cm) allowance outside of the shape. Cut along the outline you just drew with your sharp fabric scissors. Purchase 60 wt. Ready your main fabric, such as a pillowcase, bag or piece of clothing. Smooth out your fabric. Thread your sewing needle with a medium to long piece of cotton thread. Get comfortable. Anchor your thread to your fabric by inserting the needle through the bottom of the fabric and pulling it taut.  , Start on a curved edge of the applique shape, instead of at the edges.  , Use a slip stitch to turn the fabric under. Hold your needle parallel to the fabric so you keep your stitches small. Return your stitch backwards along the line of the freezer paper a few millimeters. Repeat as you go around your applique. Knot the thread when you finish and reach the point at which you started.
To create a leather cuff, you will need strips of tooled leather, leather glue, a leather needle, waxed linen thread, and a button snap or clasp for the ends of the bracelet.  Use a ruler to measure a strip of leather 2 inches (5.08 cm) wide, by the length of your wrist plus one inch. Cut the leather to size with a pair of sharp scissors or utility knife.  Attach your cut and sized leather to a larger, tooled piece of leather with leather glue. Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles, and allow it to dry overnight. Adding a second layer of leather to your bracelet will give a more finished look.  Trim the edge off the tooled leather to make it the same size as your original strip. You should now be left with a nearly completed double-sided leather strip.  Use a leather needle and waxed linen thread to stitch the cuff together. Any stitch is appropriate; the stitching is simply securing the edges of the leather and giving a more sophisticated look.  Use your needle and thread or the leather glue to secure your clasps to either end. With the completion of this step, you're finished!	Get your supplies prepared. Measure and cut your leather. Layer your leather. Cut the bracelet to size. Stitch the edges. Add your clasps.
Orion is very big and obvious, so it makes a good starting point. , The bottom-left star in the V should be bright and red. This is Aldebaran. Be careful - if you reach the Pleiades, you've gone too far!, It is also the Hyades cluster. Aldebaran isn't actually part of the cluster - it's closer, in between Earth and the Hyades., Without binoculars, you should be able to see the five main stars in the V, maybe a few more. With binoculars, the whole cluster jumps into view. When I tried it, I counted over 50 stars that I could only see with binoculars., You'll notice that the stars of the Hyades are relatively dim, and blue-white in colour. This is one of the first hints that Aldebaran, a bright, red star, is not a part of the cluster., One of the first things that you should notice through a telescope is that, unlike the Pleiades, the Hyades has little to no nebulosity. This indicates that it is an older cluster, and all of the star-forming material has been used up.	Start by finding Orion.  Go from the leftmost star in Orion's belt and up through Bellatrix (the star across from Betelgeuse). ,  Continue in the same direction until you reach a V of stars.  This V of stars is the core of the Taurus constellation.  Zoom in on the V shape with binoculars. Take some time to look around the cluster. Grab a telescope and look at the Hyades.
This is a simple black notebook with "Death Note" written on the front and, usually, a list of rules and instructions inside. In the manga series, the Death Note is a way to kill people. Make your own Death Note notebook, or buy one on Amazon or eBay.; , It doesn't have to be expensive or fancy, just try to keep the majority of your jewelry, silver chains, bangles, studs, tapers, facial piercings, and rings. Wear a lot but don't overdo it, which means just make the accessories stand out without having a heavy weight of them on your costume. For more references, see a photo of Ryuk and try as much to mirror him.  The minimum amount of make up you should wear is black eyeliner, gray/blue/white eye shadow, black mascara, and a red/wine lipstick.  Ryuk is clearly obsessed with apples - he carries them everywhere, and they can even be used as a bargaining tool to make him do something. You don't need to eat apples all the time, but at least carry one around with you, for they are basically one of Ryuk's trademarks.  Black shirts, black skinny jeans/skirts and the like are recommended for extra effects and mood.  Just like the actual Ryuk following Light/Kira.  it's not in Ryuk's character.  Think about imitating Ryuk when he floats around Light. Keep a hunched back, limp arms, and a big, creepy smile on your face.  Do this in a discreet manner when something amuses you.  No matter what the people or critics say, this is your costume, your character, your mood and just basically "you". Add your own touch to this. Be unique!	Get a Death Note. Wear a lot of silver jewelry. Wear dark, Gothic, or punk make up. Show an obsession with apples. Wear a lot of black. Follow one of your friends around like a creeper. Don't play for sides. Your body posture should be tall and skinny. Laugh. Most of all, be yourself.
The ideal location will be as dust free as possible. You should also consider spraying down the floor and/or walls to reduce the chance of stirring up dust. Good ventilation is a must. It helps remove dust and other contaminants and also removes the excess paint and thinner from the room.  This will protect yourself from toxic materials in the paint, as well as protect your paint job from anything falling off of your body. Having your head and body covered minimizes the risk of a hair or piece of lint falling onto the paint surface. At the very least, a mask/respirator is a must for safety.   Paints and paint thinners (also known as reducers) contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These VOCs are flammable and toxic. They are dangerous to inhale and are also absorbed through the skin and eyes., The tape should outline the part of the rim you wish to paint without touching it. The part of the wheel that you want to paint should not have any tape on it. This can be a slow and tedious process depending on the design of your wheel and whether or not you opted to remove your tires and valve stem., This will be the primary protection from overspray. By blocking the excess paint from landing on other surfaces of the wheel, you save yourself a lot of time trying to clean it off later. Any overspray that does end up in unwanted places will have to be carefully removed with lubricant and a clay bar., Trim out the center of the plastic. This will expose the section of the wheel you wish to paint. Tape the outside of the circle you made (the cut edges of the plastic) and down to the first layer of tape that you laid. Tape the rest of the plastic edges down as well. This will seal off any entrance for overspray to get on the rest of your wheel.	Choose a place to paint. Wear protective gear. Put tape around the perimeter of your paint surface. Cover the entire wheel in plastic or paper wrap. Cut the plastic with a razor.
These objects need to be wide enough to cover the entirety of the record. They need to be heavy enough to put pressure on the record without warping it further. Two large books are best for this purpose.; , Put the first object on a flat surface, such as a table. Put the record atop the object, followed by your second heavy object. Make sure the objects cover as much of the record as possible; if any part sticks out, they may be warped.   Before you place the record between the two objects, ensure it is clean. The last thing you want is a grain of sand grinding a scratch into your record., This is perhaps the longest method you’ll use. You’re relying on constant, gradual pressure to un-warp your record, and this will take some time. Prepare to wait for days, maybe even weeks for the record to un-warp.	Gather two large, heavy objects. Place the warped record between the objects. Prepare to wait for a few days.
A traditional eyepatch is made out of black cloth. You can use the cloth of your choice. A popular material is canvas, but this isn’t the most comfortable. You could instead use a fabric that is soft like cotton, if you plan to wear the patch for an extended time period.You can also gather scrap cardboard if you choose to use it.; , Use a ruler to measure one of your eyes and the surrounding area. Most eyepatches will extend from your eyebrows to below your eyes. Measure from your eyebrows to the top of your cheek bone for the vertical distance. Then measure from the center of your nose to the other side of your eye for the horizontal distance. Jot these measurements down on paper.   After gauging how large you want your eyepatch, measure and draw the dimensions onto the cloth. You can use chalk to best see your outline.Create a sunglass lens shape out of the rectangle. Be sure to hit the edges of the rectangle when drawing your outline.  Use sewing scissors to cut out your eyepatch.Once you have your patch cut, use a lighter to burn away any of the frayed strings left behind. Removing the frayed strings will create a cleaner looking eyepatch.  To create a stiff eyepatch that will look dramatic, you can attach a piece of cardboard to the backside of the eyepatch. Lay the eyepatch onto a piece of clean cardboard. Then trace the patch onto the cardboard using a pen. Now cut out the cardboard.   Glue the patch onto the cardboard using standard glue or a hot glue gun. Use more fabric than is needed to completely cover the cardboard, and curl the excess fabric onto the back side of the cardboard so that the front of the patch is seamless. This isn't necessary, but it might look more believable than just using cloth.  Use a seamstress’ measuring tape to measure your head. Take note of your dimensions. When preparing the string you should leave extra slack to account for attaching and adjustments.  Use black string for an authentic look. Measure out your string to the same length you documented for your head. Remember to leave about two inches of slack for tying knots and adjustments.   If black string isn't available, use whatever you have. Darker colors work best.  Some hair ties will work as a string for your eyepatch. If you find that your hair tie is too small, use a headband. Cut whichever type of band you use so that it is in the shape of a string.   You can also rip an elastic band out of an old pair of pants.  Before attaching the string to the eyepatch, try wearing it by using your hands to hold everything in place. This will help you gauge if the string is the right dimension.   Make adjustments if needed., You can either create a hole to tie the string, or glue the string onto the patch. If you decide to make inserts into the patch, use a sharp knife. Create small holes on the far left and right side of the patch.   If you decide to glue, prepare a hot glue gun or superglue., Tie a small overhand knot if you created holes. Make sure you took into account the slack needed to attach the string. Use a hot glue gun or superglue to attach the string. Glue your string behind the front of the patch to create a sleeker look., Eyepatches are classic accessories for a variety of costumes. Slip the eyepatch over your head and you have your very own eyepatch.   For decorations, you can color onto the patch using a white marker. A classic costume decor is the pirates flag.	Gather your cloth. Measure the dimensions. Cut the outline. Use cardboard for support. Measure your head. Prepare the string. Use a hair tie. Test it on yourself. Prepare a hole. Attach the string. Wear the patch.
You can take either a traditional class or an online course. If you are older than 16, a driver's education class is not required, but is encouraged.  This can be obtained from a local driver license exam office for a small fee, or downloaded for free from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety site.  Wear your glasses or contacts if you plan to wear them when you drive.  The Class D, or standard license, application fee is $4, while the fee for the physical permit itself is $21.50.  Once you pass the written test, you are allowed to drive with an adult over age 21 in the passenger's seat. , This can be an original or certified copy of your birth certificate, military ID, passport or state ID card.  The most common types include a school photo ID, Social Security card, school degree or insurance card. You may also present any primary forms of ID not already used.  A parent needs to sign an affidavit before you get an Oklahoma license.  To get a license in Oklahoma, you must pass the 8th Grade Reading Proficiency Test. You also must show proof that you are enrolled in school, or have either a high school diploma or a GED.  The minimum required is liability only.  The Class D application fee is $4, while the fee for the physical permit is $21.50. Drivers over 61 years old pay the reduced cost of $11.25.  You may take the driving test up to three times in 30 days if you fail the first time.  Teens must drive with this type of restricted license for a year. Teenagers can drive alone between 5 a.m. and 11 p.m., or with a licensed driver during other times. If you are over 18, you will be issued a regular Oklahoma license.	Take a driver's education course if you are younger than 16 years old. Study the Oklahoma Driver's Manual. Take the vision exam. Pay the learner's permit application and license fees. Pass the written driving test to get your learner's permit. Practice driving with your permit for at least six months before you get your Oklahoma driver's license.  , Bring a primary form of identification to the exam office. Take a secondary form of identification with you. Bring a parent or legal guardian with you if you are not yet 18. Show documentation that you have passed the school requirements. Present proof of insurance before taking the driving test. Pay the fees for the application and Oklahoma driver's license. Pass the driving test. Get a graduated driver's license if you are under age 18.
If an accident appears imminent, you need to respond quickly but smoothly. Vehicles of all types respond better to smooth steering and braking inputs.  You need to decide what combination of steering, braking and accelerating will best serve to avoid or minimize the harm from an accident.  Braking practices vary depending upon whether your vehicle has anti-lock brakes.   No anti-lock brakes - If your car lack anti-lock brakes, you need to pump the brakes to keep the car under control. If you slam on the brakes, your car will start to skid and you will lose control. You cannot steer a vehicle when the brakes are locked. Press firmly, then release. If you feel the tires start to skid release the brakes before steering. Anti-lock brakes - Do not pump anti-lock brakes. Your car's ABS computer will pulse them much faster than you can (you will feel the pedal vibrate a bit when this occurs). Just hold the brakes firmly and steer normally.  - Very jerky motions of the steering wheel, especially with heavy vehicles or those with light rear ends (e.g., pickup trucks) are likely to lead to skids.  Although it seems counter-intuitive, sometimes the best way to avoid an accident is to speed up and get out of the way.  If your car starts to skid or if a tire blows, follow these steps to control the car.   Don't hit the brakes. This will only make things worse. Keep a firm grip on the wheel. Steer in the direction of the skid. If the back of your car is sliding to the driver's left, turn the wheels to the left. Wait for your tires to regain traction before braking or pressing the accelerator.   Avoid head-on collisions into other vehicles or front-end collisions into immovable objects like large trees or concrete barriers. Do as much as you can to control your car's speed. The faster the impact, the more damage it will cause. Avoid side impacts. Serious injury is likely to result if another car strikes your car on the side where it is much weaker structurally and closer to the driver.  This especially important if one of the vehicles involved in the crash was carrying dangerous goods (e.g. flammable goods such as paraffin or aerosols, or explosive goods), as in such crashes it is important to prevent explosions or fires, as much as you are not in a film and in reality cars can only really explode or catch fire after crashes if the crash involved a vehicle carrying dangerous goods.  Apply first aid if needed. Do not attempt to removed injured people from a vehicle yourself. Explosions are very unlikely, and you could aggravate any neck spinal injuries, even if the victim feels uninjured. Leave removal of injured people to the emergency services.	Stay calm. Choose your course of action. Brake with control. Steer smoothly. Accelerate if needed. Take steps to recover if you start to skid or lose control. If a crash is unavoidable, try to minimize damage. After a crash, switch off your engine, do not smoke, and stop anyone else from smoking. Call emergency services after a crash.
Take into account the size of your garden and the amount of sunlight it gets.; , You may have to pare down your list or enlarge your garden space., Order seeds from a seed catalog or visit your local greenhouse nursery for seeds (and for transplants in late spring).  You will have to start all seeds indoors that require a long maturation; vegetables like like cool weather, such as spinach, can be sown directly in the ground in early spring.   Germinate seeds in peat pots, small clay flower pots or a shallow pan. Water the seeds thoroughly, but gently using a fine mist spray bottle. Place the containers in a sunny window that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight a day. You can supplement sunlight with fluorescent tube lighting. Place the lights about 8” (203.2 mm) above the seed containers. Seal off all drafts from the window and keep the room reasonably warm or the seeds won’t sprout. Keep the soil moist; never let the soil dry out. Transplant your seedlings to larger containers once they have developed leaves. Harden your plants gradually or several weeks before you put them in the ground. Hardening, or toughening, prepares your vegetables to withstand the outdoor weather. You can harden the plants by placing them outside on a porch or patio for a few hours each day, or by decreasing the amount of water you’ve been giving them. Lowering the temperature in the room they grow in will also help toughen them up.  Contact your local agricultural extension service to see if they perform soil samples, otherwise check your local garden store to see if they offer that service.  This often means simply adding organic compost matter to enrich the soil.  These can be planted before danger of frost is over.  In some parts of the Midwest, you may not be able to do this until mid-June.  A thick layer of mulch around the plants will help the soil retain moisture and control weeds.	Decide during the winter which types of vegetables, fruits, and herbs you wish to grow. Calculate how much space your vegetables will require by the time they mature. Buy all the seeds you will need to plant your garden. Start sowing seeds indoors no later than February. Test your garden soil to make sure it contains all the proper nutrients. Amend your soil as needed. Plant all cool-season vegetables and herbs as soon as the ground can be worked. Transplant your hardened seedlings after all danger of frost is over. Keep your garden mulched.
Garnet has huge, cubical hair - a difficult thing to pull off in real life. You'd be best going with a very large black wig.  You might have to sew on the two star layers (bright pink outer, light pink center), but you could potentially find a good top online. As for her sleeves, it's okay to have normal sleeves and not large, cubic ones. Puffed sleeves may get you closer, and styrofoam may get you even closer. Note that the left sleeve is dark red and matches the right side of her pants, while the right sleeve is the same pink as the outer layer of her star.  Garnet's original design has asymmetrical two-toned pants; you can create this effect by replacing the right leg of a black pair of leggings with a leg from a dark red pair. If you're not into sewing, you could simply cut off the right leg on the black leggings and wear them over the red.  You'll need to cut the gloves up a bit, too: they end at the wrist, save for a strip of fabric that goes up and covers the middle finger, leaving most of the hand exposed.   However, you could also leave the palm of the gloves intact to attach gems to. This is possibly the only safe way to include Garnet's gems in this cosplay.  In this design, Garnet's shades appear to be a pinkish-white, most likely due to their reflectivity. Most darker shades, however, will suit the purpose.  Garnet's outfit is basically a jumpsuit, so she doesn't technically wear shoes. Jumpsuits like this are rather hard to come by, though, so you'll be best off wearing black boots.	Get a wig. Get a black top and think about the star. Get two pairs of leggings. Get a pair of long, black gloves. Get the shades. Think about shoes.
If the temperature is uncomfortably hot and/or humid both day and night, then this method isn't appropriate for you. If this is only the case during the day, a window fan can be successfully used to bring the temperature down at night. If you live in a very polluted area, using a window fan will pull this pollution inside. Window fan ventilation is not recommended for those without adequate window screens, as insects or animals may enter through the open windows. Gnats and other small insects often get in right through window screens, so be prepared to accept that or don't use this method. In high crime areas, windows accessible from the outside are also likely to be used as a means of entrance by criminals. Noises outside the home will also become louder inside with the window open, although the fan noise may mask some of this.; , Ideally, each fan should be the largest that will fit inside the window. Avoid fans that are too large for the window, as positioning them near the window, outside the window frame, frequently results in their falling over. Your house should have an approximately even capacity blowing inward as outward (bearing in mind that smaller, less powerful fans should be counted as a portion of a fan for calculation purposes). If you have an uneven capacity that can't be balanced, it's better to have more blowing inward, as that creates a slight positive pressure inside the home, which prevents carrying dust and insects in when doors are opened and stops "bad air" from backing down chimneys.  This will also determine which fans will blow inward and which outward. There are many considerations here:   Blow inward on the coolest sides of the house. This will typically be the sides in shade. Work with the prevailing wind direction, pointing fans in the same direction as the wind blows, rather than fighting the wind. On days when the wind is strong enough, you may not even need the fans. In a single-story flat, arrange fans to blow inward on one side of the house and outward on the opposite side, with the doors open in between for maximum air flow. For multi-story houses, another option is to use the fact that heat rises to assist the air flow by blowing cool air into the lower floors and hot air out of the upper floors, including the attic (with the attic door left open if possible). Avoid blowing inward near garbage cans or parking areas, where fumes and odors may enter the house. Air intake near trees or plants often provides pleasant smelling air, unless pollen presents a problem. Fans blowing inward toward a refrigerator/freezer may blow cool air out quicker than usual (when open), thus increasing the load on the device, so avoid this. Bear in mind that an inward blowing fan may disrupt loose papers, so avoid this in areas like a home office, or secure all papers first. Avoid placing inward blowing window fans above valuable items, like an antique desk or expensive oriental rug, to prevent water damage. Rooms with fans blowing inward will both seem cooler (due to the increased circulation) and will cool down quicker than rooms with fans blowing out.  Close the window as tightly as possible around the fan to hold it in place and prevent local circulation. Local circulation is where the same air blown through the fan then goes back around the fan and gets sucked back in, repeating the cycle indefinitely. This just results in the motor warming the air.  If the fan is blowing inward, the air will want to go back out around the fan due to a local pressure increase. Placing drapes or even paper at the sides of the fan will often work in this case, since they will be suctioned to the window screen. Fans blowing outward are more difficult to mask, as the air around them will want to blow inward. You could place paper or cardboard on the outside of the window, if it's accessible, or tape it down on the inside. Or, you could opt to skip the masking in this case and accept the lower efficiency instead.  Turn them off, remove the fans and close the windows when the house is cool enough to offset the predicted daytime temperature. A general rule of thumb is that the inside daytime temperature will be the average of the outside daytime temperature and the inside nighttime temperature. So, if you want to keep the inside temp down to 70 °F (21 °C) and are expecting a high of 80 degrees outside, you need to lower the inside temp to 60 degrees at night. This will vary from home to home, but you can use this rule of thumb until you figure out the formula for your area. In this example, the fans could be turned off once the inside temperature dropped below 60.	Evaluate if your situation is appropriate for this cooling method. Choose your fan(s). Decide on the placement of window fans. Place fans in windows. Mask window gaps adjacent to the fan. Turn on window fans whenever it is cooler outside than inside.
Depending on your location and time of year, it may be difficult to find perfect branches and twigs. Ideally, you want them to be dry and easily accessible. Dead branches and twigs are easier to work with because they are more flexible. Choose a strong thick piece to use as the trunk of the jewelry tree and a thicker log for your base.Choose your twigs and branches that have character. It’s okay if there are slight imperfections because you can shape your trunk and branches later.  Use a miter saw or handsaw to cut a 1.5 inch disk from your log. The disk will support your trunk and act as base for stability as you place your jewelry., Use a handsaw or limb pruner to cut your trunk to your desired height. You want a trunk that’s about 22 inches tall for a thick base. Cut off any unsightly imperfections and trim down any extra branches on your trunk., Using a drill bit that is the same diameter as your trunk, drill a hole about ⅔ of the way into the disk. Use a spade bit to drill a hole about the same width of the branch that you are using as the trunk of your jewelry tree.The spade bit should have slightly poked through the bottom of the base but make sure that the rest of the bit does not. Test that the trunk fits fare enough into the base that it is stable. Continue drilling carefully if it still needs more room.  Insert the trunk into the base disk and turn it upside down. You should see the hole in which the tip of your spade bit came through. Use a small drill bit, slightly smaller than 2 inches, to drill a hole through the bottom of the disk and into the bottom of the trunk, about ½ - ¾ inches.Make sure to keep the trunk inserted in the base until you are finished drilling.  Turn your bamboo bowl upside down and drill through the center with the same drill bit you used to drill the hole in your trunk, slightly smaller than two inches. Create a countersink hole large enough for the head of the screw by using a slightly larger drill bit to drill into the bowl but not deep enough that you drill through it.Use tape to mark off how deep you want to drill your countersink hole.  Use a dollop of Gorilla glue to glue the trunk branch into the disk base. Only use enough glue to fit neatly into the large hole of the disk base. Allow the glue to sit for an hour and harden., Once the branch has been securely glued into the base disk, turn it over and place some Gorilla Glue at the center and around the edges of the base disk and set it at the bottom of the bamboo bowl., Insert your two inch wood screw at the bottom of the bowl and thread it through the disk base and the trunk branch using hole that you drilled earlier. Secure the branch as you gently tighten the screw snugly inside the countersink hole., Let the trunk’s natural shape dictate where your should attach your branches and what directions they should sprout. Choose branches that are sturdy and that have character.Match drill bits with the width of the new branches and drill holes into the trunk. Drop a bit of Gorilla Glue into the holes and add your branches.You may also attach your new branches using twine for are more artful look. Cut a long piece of twine and secure your new branches onto the trunk. Wrap each branch tightly but make sure to switch directions to secure the branches. Tie a knot at the end of the twine and Gorilla glue the end of the twine neatly., Keep the branches in place with other loose branches or scraps as the glue dries. Make sure to check on your grafted branches as the glue dries so that they don’t shift or fall., Clean off any bits of dirt or debris once the glue has dried. Store larger pieces of jewelry, like bracelets or bangles, in the bamboo bowl. Display necklaces and earings on the trunk and grafted branches.	Gather your branches. Cut your base. Cut the trunk of your tree. Drill a hole on your base. Drill a hole in the bottom of the trunk. Create a countersink hole in your bamboo bowl. Glue the trunk branch into the base. Glue the base into the bowl. Screw the base into the bowl. Add new branches. Allow the branches to dry. Clean off your jewelry tree and add jewelry.
If you're hiring workers to help, you need to know how much you'll pay them. If you're painting for someone else, you need to know how much is fair to charge them. One to two painters can usually paint 2,500 square feet in one to two days. It usually costs around $800 a day.For a small room, such as the 650 square foot example, it should only take a few hours. Divide 650 by 2,500 to get roughly .25. This means you will probably only pay a quarter of the cost of a full day's worth of work, meaning the paint job will be roughly $200.  If there is a lot of furniture to move or if you're painting with different colors, this will tack on extra time. If you believe the job will require extra labor, tack on some extra money. For example, if you're painting your 650 square foot room two different colors, add $100 on to the labor costs. This brings labor costs to $300., Unfortunately, paint jobs do not always go as planned. Parts of a home may become damaged, paint may spill, and so on. It's a good idea to give yourself a little wiggle room. You can give consumers an estimate roughly $50 to $100 higher in case of an accident., After you have all the individual costs calculated, add them together to get a rough estimate. In the 650 square foot example, the estimate would come to around $535. In case of accidents, you can quote about $635., If you're hiring painters, it's not always a good idea to try to calculate costs yourself. Get a quote from several different companies, explaining your needs and the size of your home. This will give you a more accurate price and help you budget for a paint job.	Factor in the basic cost of labor. Think about anything that could lengthen painting time. Account for potential accidents. Calculate the total cost. Ask for a professional estimate.
Try Pepsi bottles. Clean them out and bring them to your work space.; , Be careful of sharp edges!  , It will look smokey and will fill a bit rough. If you don't follow this step the paint won't stick to the plastic. Continue this on the three bottom pieces, 1 of the top pieces and 2 of the middle pieces.  Try an All Purpose Acrylic: Morning Silver paint.  If you apply it in horizontal strokes, it gives a more scarred metallic look as if it's been through battles.  You'll need a total 14 for each gauntlet if you make it like Mordred's. If you don't want spikes on the gauntlet, only cut out 5 for the hand.   Be aware that the plastic at the bottom is much thicker and harder to cut, then it is anywhere else on the bottle. Once cut out, you can put this to the side.  Cut it vertically before carefully wrapping the plastic lose around your arm with enough space to take it off. Seal the two parts together by taping them with a few strips of duck tape  , Make one larger then the other. With the large piece, follow the same steps you did in step 6, using the arm piece from 6  as a base for it.   Leave a small gap in between as shown in the second picture. This is for the spikes and to give more stability to the plastic. Using a hot glue gun, glue the strips together along with any flaps that aren't secure. , Bend 9 of them in two places at the bottom to make a place for the to be glued later. The other 5 need to be cut into shape for the hand. the second image is a zoomed up of that.   Note that the finger joints need 3 pieces, while the thumb need 2, the bottom is longer then the rest.  Also note the joints are folded in the second picture to show what the pattern looks like.  Then, carefully cut two small holes in both sides of the plastic  at the top, and then again on the bottom of the arm piece. Attach the pieces together by use of the 2 twist ties. this allows to bottom guard to move slightly when you move you hand. , If you don't do this, you can easily burn yourself as the hot glue burns at a temperature of 170 °C (338 °F) { 338 Fahrenheit.} This step is a bit dangerous so you must be very careful.  Finally attach the hand guard and glue it in place as well.  This is a good project if you like making costumes, working on a low budget school film or if you just enjoy making things.	Get three {3} 2-liter bottles. Cut the tops and bottoms off; the leftover should look like this. Sand the plastic. Once the pieces are fully sanded you can start painting it. Carefully cut out the stands from the bottom of the bottle. Take one of the middle pieces. With the second middle piece, cut it into two halves. Take the smaller of the pieces you cut in step 7 and cut a small slip off from it, leaving the larger one just enough to be able to cover the bottom of arm piece.  , Take the stand you cut before. Glue each of the 9 stands to the base of the gauntlet inside the areas as shown in the picture{three to each section.}, using the top piece from the bottle, cut out a hand guard like the picture, The back of of it should bend around to  give you added support.  , A little tip is to put on your old glove and then put a cardboard cut out on top of your hand to protect if from the hot glue. Put the glove on and put some form of protection between your skin and the fabric and slowly hot glue the finger joints to the glove. Enjoy your new gauntlet.
If you have purchased spring onions from the store, you can save the roots and replant them. After you have used the spring onions in your cooking, cut off the root approximately ½ an inch (1.5 cm) from the end., After you have cut off the roots of the spring onions, place them in water with the shoots sticking up. Within a few days you will begin to see a bit of new growth. They are then ready to be planted in your garden or small planter., The holes should be deep enough to completely cover the roots. Space the onions at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.  If you are planting more than one row of onions, the rows should be no less than 6 inches (15 cm) apart.  The roots should be completely covered and the sprouts should be sticking out of the soil.	Cut the spring onions and keep the roots. Place the roots in water. Dig a row of small holes. Place one bulb into each hole.
To perform this, sit on the floor with one leg extended in front of you, and the other one drawn up with the knee bend and your foot flat on the floor. Reach forward with both your arms to touch the toes (or reach past the toes) on your extended foot. Keep your leg straight with no bend in the knee, and hold it for 5-10 seconds. Repeat this several times on both legs.  This is performed similar to a push-up and builds abdominal strength and endurance. Lay on your stomach, and then lift yourself up using your toes and your forearms, keeping your entire body straight as a board. Hold this for at least 15 seconds to start, and gradually add on time.  You can do this a multitude of ways, but the easiest is to stand and lift one foot off the ground at a time, rolling your ankle in small circles in each direction., Pull your shoulders back and down. Make you neck long, and keep your chin parallel to the floor. You must only squeeze the inner-upper parts of your arms so they stay directly by your side, with your hands in the shape of fists. Your legs should be straight with locked knees. You should always be on your toes, and even if a leg in the air, all toes on both feet should be points. Also, your feet must be pointed outwards. It is a hard concept to grasp, but after a while of dancing it will be second nature to dance with your feet turned outwards. Try walking around home, school, work, etc, with your feet turned out for a half hour everyday. It will train your feet, telling them that they need to stick out. Another way to teach your feet to turn out is to go ice skating. When you skate, your feet have to be turned out to accelerate. Pay close attention to your feet next time you go ice skating	Do the hurdlers stretch. Do a plank. Stretch your ankles. Keep good posture.
Plants need sun in order to convert carbon dioxide and water into their food and energy. While potted plants are often easy to arrange on porches and balconies, they still need access to proper sunlight. To keep them healthy, your plants need at least five hours of sunlight per day.Check your plant’s insert or information to see if it needs full sun or can thrive in the shade. Remember that shade-friendly plants still need indirect sunlight to stay alive.  Your plant will need soil that is formulated for potted plants because they are growing in a different situation than plants that are in the ground. One of the ingredients that your soil will need is decaying organic matter, which is in most good potting soils. Organic matter will break down into the nutrients that your plant needs to absorb to be healthy., Potted plants require more added nutrients than plants that are in the ground, so regularly add fertilizer to your soil.Supplement your soil by adding organic matter either through a commercial fertilizer or your own composting.   Some fertilizers are liquid and can be added directly to the watering can you use to water your plants, making it an easy part of your plant care routine.  If your plant has wilted leaves or buds, remove them from the rest of the plant. This will encourage new growth instead of allowing your plant to shrivel up., If you start a plant indoors or have moved it inside over the winter, don’t move it permanently outdoors without a transition period. A plant that is accustomed to living indoors is not equipped to survive outside. The environment is different and can cause the plant to wither; additionally, the rain levels can cause overwatering., Choose a chemical-free pesticide treatment that’s formulated to protect your plants. Different plants attract different pests, so read the label to make sure that you pick the right product.   Don’t try to kill all bugs, as some can be friendly to your garden.	Place them in the sun. Choose a good potting soil. Add fertilizer. Prune the dead parts off of your plants. Avoid sudden transitions from indoors. Protect from pests.
Loop over for the first step of the braid.          Add the next bead and loop the string over itself.              Continue adding beads and then make the next step for braiding.  You will be braiding the remaining portion of the bracelet.  Make sure the knot is larger than the bead so it doesn’t slide forward.	Thread the first bead onto the first string. Finish adding beads until approximately half of the bracelet is left. Tie a small knot after the last bead to hold it in place.
It will also be easier to drain.; ,, Jack the truck up using the floor jack. Place the jack in the center of the front brace between the front tires. Make sure that the surface you are parked on is level and stable, so that the jack doesn't move(if not make sure blocks are placed under back tires). Jack the truck up so the front tires are off the ground. For safety purposes, you should also place a jack stand under the brace just inside of the two front tires. This is to make sure the vehicle does not fall on you if the jack fails. Blocking the rear tires will also help eliminate the risk of the jack moving.  Be sure to know what type of oil your vehicle requires. If you do not know, you can find this information in your vehicle manual, as well as the oil capacity.  Locate the oil pan and loosen the bolt located on the end of the oil pan. The drain plug. Before you loosen the bolt place bucket under the bolt to catch the oil.  After, take the wrench, and tighten it another quarter to half rotation. This will ensure that the bolt it tightened enough, but not so tight that it is going to pinch the rubber seal.  Before the filter is completely screwed out, again place the container under the filter to catch any oil that is still in the filter.  Be sure that you have purchased the correct filter, as sizes will vary depending on model and type of motor you truck has. Also check to make sure you have removed the O-ring from the old filter off of the filter housing. To ensure that the new filter gets installed properly.  This is to ensure that there is a good seal once the new filter is screwed in.  Then take the oil filter wrench and tighten another quarter turn. ,, Be sure to remove any debris that could potentially fall into the oil.  Screw the oil cap back on and close the hood of the vehicle. , Top off oil if needed. Do not forget to release the parking brake before the vehicle is driven again.	Before you change your oil you should run your truck and get the oil warm so that it will gather all the dirty particles. Make sure you set the parking brake.  , First you must obtain a floor jack and jack stands. Get a wrench that fits your drain plug, an oil filter, an oil filter wrench, a bucket to catch the oil, and the oil. Slide under the vehicle. Drain the oil from the oil pan, and clean the bolt with a rag and screw it back in with your fingers. Use the oil filter wrench to unscrew the oil filter which is to the right of the oil pan. Dispose of old filter and the new filter can be screwed in place. Take fresh oil and rub it around the rim of the filter. Hand tighten the filter. Gather the tools and move from under the vehicle.  , Remove the two jack stands and lower the floor jack.  , Pop the hood of the vehicle and unscrew the oil cap which is located on the left side of the engine. Pour the recommended amount of oil into the vehicle. Dispose used oil properly.  , Run vehicle for ten minutes, then check oil levels with dipstick.
A plastic ketchup bottle would work fine, but a squeeze bottle—like you would find in restaurants—works best.; , Some people like to use several dyes on their shirts, but only one is necessary. Each color dye will consist of:   1 tbsp (15 ml) organic nitrogen (to help conserve the color in the dye) 1 cup (236.5 ml) warm water 1 ounce (28 g) color dye  , For every gallon (3.79 l) of water, mix in 1 cup (236.5 ml) of soda ash, also known as sodium carbonate  ,   Make sure that the entire shirt is wet; any part of the shirt that is dry will not absorb the dye. Wring the shirt out well, so it is damp.  There are several different designs you can choose from when making tie-dye, among them the spiral design and the sun design.	Get a bottle to dispense the dye. Prepare your dye/s. Prepare your soda ash mixture in a tub or sink. Wet your white cotton T-shirt in the soda ash mixture. Choose your design.
Human beings are enormously complex, and much of our communication comes from body language, not just words. So what is your character's posture like? Do they command the room or slouch in the corners? Do they move around or stay very still? Do they get really engaged when talking, or remain reserved and aloof?  You don't need to come up with unique tics and traits for every character, as this will be overkill for many parts. But you do need to think about how they stand, sit, and speak. Basic posture is easy to study if you're unsure -- walk into any restaurant or public setting and just people watch Separate yourself from the character. You might not use your hands when talking, but an older Italian character couldn't stop using them., Great actors remain in character the entire scene, feeding off their co-actors to keep the scene alive even when they're not talking. Knowing the other actor's lines and being ready to respond to them makes the entire performance better, and helps you stay in character.   Real people (not characters being acted) stay in the moment. Don't think about your next scene or a flubbed line from before -- clue right into the present moment. Watch Charlie Day in the show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia for a funny example of acting reactions. Even when he's in the background, he keeps up the nervous, unpredictable energy that makes his character (and the actor) so popular.  Where you stress words matters as much as how fast you say them. Take the simple line, "I love you." You can stress all three words and get three different sounding sentences -- "I love you." (about "me"); "I love you" (about discovering love); or "I love you," (about them). You, as an actor, need to decide which of these moments is worth the most attention.  If in doubt, talk to the director. They may have a vision for the line or the character's arc that you need to mesh with. Emphasis is also important in monologues and paragraphs. In a long speech there is almost always a moment where the mood, subject, or idea evolves or switches. Find this point and make it a strong transition for your character.  "Blocking" is where an actor stands, where they move, and when they do it. For film sets, this is usually meticulously mapped out to aid cameras, lights, and sound crews. It is essential that you stick to this blocking, otherwise you can ruin the entire shot, so don't try to improvise something new on the spot. Even theatrical actors need to stick to blocking consistently, as your movements dictate other actors' movements and some stage effects.  Good actors rehearse and find the role before shooting. That way they can show up and consistently hit marks and lines instead of trying to figure it out on the fly., An improv class teaches you the art of acting in the present. To be good at improv, the character will always appear naturally, because it is happening in real time and not dictated by a script. This will help build the essential skill of reacting to the events in real time and not reading off a page. It also raises your on-stage awareness of other lines, actors, and props.Many acting classes offer improv as a warm-up or a unit, so you can often get a little improv practice in with a "classic" acting class. When improvising, focus on building up the scene. Basically, this means always agreeing to your other actors, then adding a twist. To practice, work on responding to each line with a "Yes! and also..."	Think about your character's physical posture and habits, not just their lines. Pay attention to your reactions to other characters' lines, not just when it is "your turn.", Think about the point of emphasis in each line or paragraph. Be consistent on stage or set to making shooting a breeze. Take improvisation classes to improve on-stage reactions and acting.
Unfurl the snake and lower the bulbous metal end into the toilet bowl. Begin the feeding the snake into the mouth of the drain. At the end of the snake is a curved hook, which will help break up and grab debris that has accumulated in the pipes.; , Once the snake is in position, start steadily rotating the handle on the opposite end. This will extend the snake and force its length slowly through the pipes. Plumbing snakes are constructed with flexible metal coils, so it will be able to bend and follow the contours of the pipes as it is unwound.Unclogging a toilet with a snake is as simple as turning the crank a few times.  If you notice the snake slowing down or coming to a stop, it may have encountered resistance. Jostle the shaft slightly to help the snake loosen up whatever is stuck deep in the pipes. Continue turning the handle in a clockwise direction until the snake clears the pipe.Don’t be rough with the shaft of the snake or try to draw out the clog by force. Just keep winding and unwinding and let it wear down the clog on its own.  After you locate and work over the clog, rotate the handle in the opposite direction (counterclockwise) to retract the snake and examine what it has collected. Always pull out the clog rather than trying force it deeper into the pipe. Repeat this process until the pipe is completely unobstructed.Pushing the clog further in may end up making the problem worse, as eventually it can get so deep that you can no longer reach it.Always make sure to sanitize your snake after each use. This can be accomplished by rinsing the snake off outside with a garden hose. You can also leave the end of the snake in the toilet for a few flushes after you've added toilet bowl cleaner., Lay down a couple of towels or a sheet of plastic to protect the floor. It’s possible that water may splash out of the toilet bowl as the snake works on the clog. This water will often become dingy as whatever is causing the clog disintegrates and leeches back through the pipes. Covering the floor can keep you from having to deal with a second mess later on.If you’re using a towel, wash it immediately after you’re finished and wipe down the floor beneath with a disinfecting solution.  Things are likely to get messy, so pull on a pair of rubber gloves to provide a barrier between your bare skin and whatever muck you may find on the other end of the snake. Toilets are full of germs, and if you don’t take proper care to protect your hands and keep them clean, the result may be illness and infection. Throw the gloves away when you’re finished and wash your hands for a full minute with antibacterial soap and hot water.Debris that is snagged on the end of the snake will have to be removed by hand. Don’t forget to roll up your shirtsleeves as you work to get them out of the way.  You’ve managed to pull out the clog that’s been blocking the pipe, but now what do you do with it? Rather than trying to flush it again and risk creating a new problem, have a trash bag or bucket on hand that you can put the icky clog material into. That way, you can simply drop the bag in the garbage or give the bucket a good rinse and carry on with your day.A plastic grocery bag makes a perfect means of disposal. After you drop the offending clog inside, tie off the bag and chuck it in the trash.  Once the job is finished, plunge the toilet a few times to get rid of any remnants of the clog. Then, pour some concentrated toilet bowl cleaner into the toilet and give it a couple flushes. The chemicals in toilet cleaning solutions are potent enough to dissolve and whisk away whatever residual debris remains in the pipes. As an added bonus, your latrine will be sparkly clean, sanitized and ready for use afterwards.Only use cleaners that are intended for toilets. Regular drain cleaners can eat through galvanized plumbing pipes and wreak havoc on septic systems.A homemade declogging solution made from vinegar and baking soda can also work wonders on clearing out your pipes after they've been snaked. Simply pour about a cup of baking soda into the bowl, add two cups of vinegar (gradually, so that the mixture doesn't bubble over into the floor), wait ten minutes and flush., Before putting anything in the toilet, make sure that it’s meant to be there. The list of things it’s okay to flush down the commode is pretty short: in most cases, human waste and toilet paper only. Never try to get rid of paper towels, Kleenex tissues, makeup pads, tampons, condoms, cardboard, hair or any other materials that aren’t easily dissolved by flushing them. You’ll just be setting yourself up for inconvenience (and possibly expensive plumbing repairs) later on.Toys are a leading culprit of clogs in households with small children. If you have kids, keep the door to your bathroom shut and make sure they know that it’s not a good place to play. If you’re not sure whether or not a certain item is safe to flush down the toilet, chances are it isn’t.  Most clogs are caused by a buildup of excess toilet paper that gets stuck in the pipes before it has time to completely break down. Be aware of the amount of toilet paper you flush on a regular basis, and see that you only use as much as you need. If you have multiple bathrooms in your home, try using a different one from time to time so that one toilet’s plumbing isn’t constantly getting overworked.Be conservative. There’s no need to use half a roll of paper every time you wipe.If you often find yourself troubled with clogs, consider switching to single ply toilet paper. It may not be as comfortable or absorbing, but it breaks down much faster after it’s flushed.  The best way to prevent a clog is to take note when you suspect one might be building up. If the water level in your toilet seems low, or it has trouble flushing or refills slowly, there may be an obstruction throttling the water flow somewhere. Use a plunger to dislodge clogs before they get bad enough that you have to break out the snake.Look for bubbles in the water in the toilet bowl and keep an ear out for rattling in the pipes. These could also be signs of blockage. Snaking should be reserved for stubborn clogs. Plunging, cleaning and not putting anything in the toilet that doesn’t belong there should be your first defenses. If you’re careful, you’ll rarely find yourself in a situation that requires the use of an auger.  Make sure that you’re cleaning your potty at least once or twice a month. Use chemicals specifically formulated for use in toilets and pay attention to any signs that suggest a clog might be forming. As has already been mentioned, chemical cleaners can help melt down stubborn clots of toilet paper and other gunk that’s become lodged in the pipes. Besides that, it will keep the place where you do your business fresh and pleasant.Cleaning your toilet’s water jets ensures that it’s flushing at full power, which will help knock out potential messes caught in the plumbing.	Place the end of the snake into the toilet. Turn the crank handle clockwise. Feel around for the clog in the pipes. Break up or pull out as much of the clog as you can. Cover the floor around the toilet. Wear gloves. Have a trash bag or other receptacle ready. Flush the pipes with toilet cleaner. Only put water-soluble items in the toilet. Reduce the amount of toilet paper you use. Identify the problem early. Keep the toilet and pipes clean.
One of the easiest ways to make a skillet handle cover is to turn a potholder into one. To do this, you will need:A potholder. You can use an old potholder, or get a new one for the purpose of turning it into a skillet handle cover. Skillet (for measuring) Pins Needle and thread or a sewing machine; , Take a potholder and fold it over the skillet handle to see where you need to sew it. To mark the area where you want to sew, place a few pins in the potholder to keep it in a folded position. Then, slide the potholder off the handle.You may even want to mark the line where you want to sew with a piece of chalk.  To secure the potholder to use as a skillet handle cover, sew along the pinned edge, removing the pins as you go. Try not to sew too far away from the pins to ensure that you get a good fit for your skillet handle.After sewing along the pinned edge, your handle cover is ready to use. Slip it onto a skillet handle to try it out!	Gather your materials. Fold the potholder in half over the skillet handle. Sew along the pinned edge.
These plants require a regular care regimen.   You will be able to keep your Venus flytraps inside or outside, planted in pots. Venus flytraps will need a good deal of sunlight and warmth for most of their growing cycle. You will need to have patience, as Venus flytraps require a period of dormancy during the winter. They will grow less and require grooming. Be prepared to trim dead leaves and blooms off of the plant to keep it healthy and to water the plant on a schedule. You may need to feed the trap with crickets or other insects if it doesn't catch many on its own.; , These plants have several different breeds or species. Some breeds are hardier than others. If you are just getting started with Venus flytraps, growers recommend the following types of Venus flytraps: King Henry, Dentate Traps, Dingley Giant, or Microdent varieties. These types tend to be hardier plants that are less susceptible to common problems like disease and root rot. The DC XL variety of Venus flytrap is known to be very hardy, but these can be more expensive than other types.  Many nurseries and home and garden stores will have them in stock during their growing season.   Venus flytraps are usually sold in season, which typically runs from mid-spring to mid-autumn. You can search at larger retailers like Home Depot or Lowes in the garden section. Walmart can even carry them, if your local store has a garden section. Smaller, privately owned nurseries are also likely to have these in stock when they are in season.  You will want a plant that looks healthy and that is growing well.   Avoid any Venus flytrap plants that are potted in regular soil. These plants require a special kind of soil that is free of minerals. Look for a plant that has vibrant green leaves and shoots. The traps themselves will be green or even reddish in color. If a plant has many dead leaves that have not been trimmed, don't choose this plant. Grooming is a part of Venus flytrap maintenance, and you will want to purchase a plant that has been properly cared for. Keep an eye out for any plants that appear wilted, dull in color, or that look sparse. These plants might have a fungal or bacterial problem and should be avoided.  If you are having trouble finding one in a retail store, there are many online sources for purchasing Venus flytraps.   Online sources, such as www.flytrapstore.com and www.growcarnivorousplants.com sell many varieties of Venus flytraps. You are more likely to find more variety in breed or species of Venus flytrap through online sellers. This can be especially helpful if you are new to raising Venus flytraps and are looking for a specific variety that is hardier, or if you are looking to expand your collection to include more variety in breeds.  Regular garden or potting soil is not appropriate for growing these plants.   Most of the time, if you buy a Venus fly trap it will already be potted in suitable soil. However, if you need to add more soil to your potted plant, you will need to get the right kind. Venus flytraps will die if they are planted in regular garden soil or potting mix. These plants naturally live in soil mediums which are free draining and contain almost no nutrients or soluble minerals. Venus flytraps naturally grow in sandy soil that has very low fertility and very little organic material. This soil is usually slightly acidic. You can buy potting mix specifically geared towards Venus flytraps. This usually contains a mixture of sphagnum moss, silica sand, and perlite.  They will not thrive in areas with too much shade.   During the spring and summer growing season, Venus flytraps will do best if they are kept in pots outdoors in direct sunlight except in the hottest weeks of summer. In the hottest part of summer, you should move your Venus flytraps to an area with partial shade or the plants will get too much direct sunlight. You can also grow Venus flytraps indoors, but they will not be as vibrant. Artificial light sources that are recommended are LEDs and fluorescent bulbs.  You should never water this plant with regular tap water.   Tap water and bottled drinking water contains too many minerals. This will kill a Venus flytrap. You should only water your Venus flytraps with distilled water, deionized water, or reverse osmosis water. You can buy these bottled in the grocery store or garden stores and they are relatively inexpensive. You can also collect rainwater to use to water your Venus flytrap.  Venus flytraps can become too moist and this will promote bacterial or fungal growth that can kill the plant.   How often you water your flytrap will depend on a number of factors. If you are keeping your plants in an area with lots of sunlight and humidity, they will dry out faster. If they are in a cool area, the soil will remain moist for longer periods. Most Venus flytrap growers recommend watering your plant every 2-5 days if you are keeping it in an area with more heat and sunlight. If you keep your flytrap in a cooler area with more shade, watering your plant every 8-10 days, or even up to every 14 days, is recommended. A good test to see if your plant needs to be watered is to feel the soil. If it is dry or cracked, the plant needs to be watered. Using a turkey baster to water your plant gently is recommended by Venus flytrap growers.  You will have to trim off dead leaves and blooms from the plant to keep it healthy.   Dead leaves not only make a plant look unhealthy, but can actually shade new growth leaves and prevent them from getting adequate sunlight. If leaves are brown and dry, they are dead. In many cases these can be gently pulled off of the stem and disposed of. Otherwise, you will need to trim off dead leaves and blooms gently with plant shears.  Most plants require fertilizer, but in the case of carnivorous plants like Venus flytraps, you will need to feed it insects.   Trap flies and put them into the traps while still alive. The motion will trigger the plants to close and trap the insect inside. It will slowly be digested by the plant's natural enzymes. This can take several weeks. If you are having trouble getting flies into the traps, put them in a jar and refrigerate them. The cold will make them sluggish and easier to put into the traps. If you can't find flies, you can feed the plant small earthworms. You can also feed it with live insects like crickets or mealworms that are used to feed lizards and reptile pets. You can buy these at pet supply stores. When feeding, you should only feed one or two traps at a time. Avoid having all of the traps on a plant full at once. Digesting all those insects will expend the energy of the plant and can cause it to wither.  Venus flytraps go through a yearly period of dormancy in the winter.   Colder weather in the fall triggers dormancy in a Venus flytrap. During this period, growth slows and traps become sluggish. During its dormant period, you can still keep the Venus flytrap outdoors but bring it inside if temperatures fall below or close to freezing. You should still water and feed the plant during dormancy, but the plant will require less water and food during this period. Check the soil of the plant to make sure it is dry before watering and decrease the frequency of insect feedings.	Consider if you can properly care for a Venus flytrap.

Keep your Venus flytrap in the right kind of soil. Keep your Venus flytraps in an area which gets regular sun. Water your Venus flytrap with pure water. Avoid overwatering your plant. Groom your plant regularly. Feed your Venus flytrap. Watch your plant for dormancy.
The easiest and most accurate way to tune your guitar properly is to use an electronic guitar tuner that reads your tone, usually provides a visual gauge of how on or off of pitch you are, and tells you which direction you need to tune. It does everything but turn the pegs for you.   These tuners range in price and quality from cheap to somewhat fancier acoustic tuners that can be fairly expensive. To get started, get a cheap one in your price range, or research free online options.  It's important on all acoustic stringed instruments, especially acoustic guitars, to tune from flat to sharp, rather than tuning from sharp to flat. You're more likely to slip out of tune if the tension on the string is going down (as it will when you tune sharp-to-flat), so it's better to create the correct directional tension on the string by tuning up, instead of tuning down.          Even if the string is sharp (which it usually won't be), tune it down lower than it should be first and then tune it up to the correct pitch.  Old worn-out strings won't stay in tune as easily. If you're having to constantly re-tune, or your strings are getting a little raggedy, consider changing the strings of your guitar to fresher strings that'll stay in tune while you play. The guitar will sound better and will be a lot more fun to practice on if you've got fresh strings on it.  Get the strings in the neighborhood and then fine-tune more accurately, especially if you're putting on new strings. The strings put a lot of tension (hundreds of pounds of pressure) on the frame of the guitar, and acoustic guitars are very susceptible to a bit of shifting and settling, especially older bodies and different varieties of wood.   Don't get frustrated if you tune the guitar perfectly and it slips out a few minutes later. This is normal. Tug on the strings some as you tune to get the extra slack out and let it sit a few minutes, then check it again.  While it's important to tune accurately and give the electric tuner its due credit, it's also important to learn to really hear the strings and learn to distinguish when something's a little off. Experienced guitar players don't have to have perfect pitch or consult their tuner to know when something's a little off. Listen to the notes as you tune and you'll be able to tune more accurately.	Invest in a quality chromatic guitar tuner. Tune up, don't tune down, whenever possible. Use fresh strings. Let the wood settle. Use your eyes and your ears.
Of course, your own decorating preferences may dictate your desired houseplant locations regardless of each location's suitability.   Jasmine and lavender are great ideas for the bedroom, as the scent of these plants can promote restful sleep and reduce anxiety levels. Aloe vera and snake plant both help purify the air, which can be helpful for locations in the home that the whole family frequents, or rooms that are subject to a variety of smells and chemicals, such as the living room, bathroom, or kitchen.Positioning houseplants largely involves compromising between ideal locations for the plants' needs, and your desired locations based on aesthetics. Inhospitable locations can still be utilized by selecting very hardy species of houseplants.; , Choose a container that satisfies your aesthetic desire for the plant, as well as the needs of the plant. There are a variety of containers available for your plants, from simple ceramic pots to troughs.   Wall mounted or hanging baskets are perfect for taking advantage of vertical space, especially if you have a plant that can grow to great lengths or hang, such as grape ivy or hindu rope plants. Boxes or troughs can be used if you have a collection of plants that visually complement one another and have similar watering and lighting needs. Even old tin cans can be used, giving a home-grown, DIY look to your plants., Your house has a theme, whether you recognize it or not, and there are a variety of plant types that can complement this theme. The color of the plant and its flowers, for example, can help round out the existing color of the room, or the smells of the plant itself can complete the ambiance.   Common themes for homes include Victorian, American Country, and Casual Easy Living. A certain plant may find itself more at home in one type of home than another (a rose in a Victorian home, or a sunflower in a casual home, for example)., Use all of the room available to you when furnishing rooms with plants. One tiny plant in a large space will not greatly change the mood of the room. The plant will just look out of place!   Larger plants with large leaves, such as dracaenas or philodendron, can fill up a large, sparsely furnished room. In smaller rooms, large plants appear to crowd. Instead, choose a smaller plant that has larger, visible leaves, such as the aralia or anthurium., Designing a houseplant setup takes time, and your setup will need to be adjusted as you progress. Perhaps you will notice a plant thriving in a location that you assumed would be inhospitable, or perhaps there is a certain location in which you cannot seem to keep anything alive. Use these experiences to reorganize your houseplant setup to keep your plants alive and well.   If you have trouble keeping your plants alive, try raising a few sturdier plants. Succulents are incredibly hardy and nearly impossible to kill. Cacti can thrive without needing very much water. Some plants, such as the English ivy or ZZ plant, are very adaptable, and able to make do with a variety of lighting situations., Place your plant near a window that provides the amount of light they need to survive. Not all plants require the same amount of light, and some will need different types of light, such as indirect or direct.   Plants that require low light, such as the kentia palm or Peace Lily, should be placed near north-facing windows. Plants requiring medium or indirect light, such as the aralia or begonia, should be placed near west- or south-facing windows. Keep them 1 to 2 feet from the window itself.Plants requiring bright or direct light, such as the amaryllis or episcia, can be placed directly on the windowsill of windows facing south or west., Many plants require a reasonably humid environment, or at least one that is not terribly dry, such as ferns. Some areas in the house will be drier or more humid than others. This will dry the plants' leaves and soil out.   For example, a windowsill just above a baseboard heater will tend to be drier than other windowsills in the home. Homes with central heating tend to be especially dry during fall and winter. Purchasing a humidifier can help provide moisture to your plants., This helps spread moisture among plants. Moisture released by one plant will be picked up by another! Remember that plants still need good air circulation to prevent disease.   Avoid placing your plants too close together. Their leaves and vines may get tangled, and this can reduce the air circulation each plant receives. Leaves that touch between two plants may also allow insects to easily move from one plant to another.  Don’t place your plants in areas where the temperature will swing throughout the day. Most plants prefer a constant temperature of between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, though there are some exceptions.   Plants that prefer cooler temperatures (between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit) include plants such as the Tulip, Azalea, and Primrose. Plants that prefer hotter temperatures (between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit) include plants such as the caladium, bromeliad, and geranium.Windowsills can become drafty during the colder months of the year. During this time, pull any plants you have resting there away from the window by a few inches. Similar draft problems can occur for plants that are located near entrances to the home. Keep plants closer to the interior of the house to avoid exposing your plants to this kind of draft., Plants have several requirements for healthy growing, with the specifics of these requirements differing from plant to plant. Ask your florist for an information card or sheet detailing the exact requirements of your plants so that you can place and treat them appropriately.   Light requirements for some plants can be supplemented with artificial lights, such as fluorescent lights. Signs that your plant may be receiving too much light include brown patches on leaves, leaves that look faded or washed out, or the plant wilts at midday., Make sure your plants get the amount of water they need to survive. This amount will increase or decrease based on the overall temperature and exposure to sunlight the plant receives. Take care not to overwater your plants – this is just as damaging as not giving them enough water.   Plants that are receiving too much water will appear wilted, have yellowing or browning leaves, and may begin to grow algae in the soil.To test whether your plant is dry, dip your finger one inch into the soil. If the soil up to this point is dry, add water. Make sure to keep your plant container drainage holes unblocked. Remove excess water from the drainage saucer to avoid overwatering., Fertilizer provides nutrients your plants need that they may not receive in an indoor setting, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Read the labels of your plant to understand what fertilizer mixtures work best for the health of the plant.   Fertilizer mixtures will be labeled in accordance to the percentages of nutrients they contain. Give new or re-potted plants a few months to adjust to their environment before fertilizing., Remove any insects you see feasting on your plants. Prolonged infestation will damage your plant, sometimes irreparably.   Many types of insects can be removed or controlled through non-chemical means. Simply washing your plant with a cloth dipped in a detergent solution (1/2 teaspoon per quart of water), can remove aphids, mites and other small insects from leaves. Larger insects, such as caterpillars or millipedes, can be removed by hand. Indoor insecticides may be used if you continue to have problems, but be very careful when doing so. Spray in an open, well-ventilated area, and make sure no pets have access to the plant, which could now harm them if they decide to have a taste.For instance, you may want to use houseplants to liven up a dark, windowless bathroom. Or, your favored window may face north and be covered in shade from neighboring buildings or plants.	Determine the locations in which you want to place houseplants. Choose a container for your plant. Match your plants to your theme. Use space to your advantage. Adjust the locations of each houseplant as needed. Give your plants enough light. Pay mind to humidity. Group your plants close together. Mind the temperature. Know the requirements of your plants. Keep your plants watered. Fertilize your plants. Keep the insects off your plants.
This is available online at http://www.mva.maryland.gov/_resources/docs/DL-002.pdf or in any office of the Maryland Motor Vehicle Authority (MVA). The Maryland Driver's Manual contains information about the driving laws in Maryland, and will be necessary to pass the written knowledge test to get your learner's permit., In Maryland, you must be at least 15 years and 9 months old before you can apply for your learner’s permit. You will be able to begin taking a classroom instruction program earlier than this. But the minimum age to apply for your learner's permit is 15 years and 9 months., When you are ready, you will need to take the following information with you to your nearest full-service MVA office:Your parents or legal guardian. This may not just be an older friend. One of your parents must be with you to sign your application. Proof of identification. You may take a U.S. Passport, or a birth certificate together with a social security card. Proof of Maryland residence. You need to bring two forms of proof of your residence in Maryland. This could be some combination of utility bills, canceled checks with a printed address, or bank statements to the address.License fee. The fee for a learner’s license is $50. You can pay by credit card, cash, check or money order. If you are under 16 years old when you are applying for your learner’s permit, then you will also need to have the Learner’s Permit School Attendance Certification Form. You can download this form online at http://www.mva.maryland.gov/_resources/docs/DL-300.pdf or pick one up from the MVA office. You may also be able to get one from your school’s office or guidance office. The form must be completed and signed by someone at your school. You then need to deliver it, in a sealed envelope, to the MVA official when you go for your learner’s permit.  When you report to the MVA for your learner’s permit, you will take a written knowledge test and a vision test.   Written knowledge test. This will cover information that is in the Maryland Driver’s Manual regarding rules of the road and requirements for driving. The test consists of 25 questions and is administered on a computer. You will need a passing score of 85% in order to pass.Vision test. To pass the vision screening, you must be able to score at least 20/40 eyesight in each eye, and a continuous field of vision (peripheral vision) of at least 140 degrees. A restricted license may be available for people with eyesight of 20/70 and field of vision of 110 degrees.  With your learner's permit, you may drive only with a licensed driver over age 21 sitting in the seat next to you and you may not use any cell phone, whether hands-free or not, while driving., This may be a class sponsored by your high school, taught by a private company, or taught by your parents. If you parents teach you, they will need to meet all state requirements and submit a statement of compliance. This class must consist of at least 30 hours of classroom training, and 6 hours of on-the-road instruction.You must have your learner’s permit before you are allowed to begin the driving training portion of any class. The MVA publishes a list of approved driver’s education programs on its website. The driving school will automatically transmit a record of your taking and passing the class to the MVA.  With your learner’s permit, you must have a licensed adult over age 21 in the car with you, and you must keep a log of the hours you drive. At least 10 hours must be night driving, and the MVA recommends that you try to spend at least some time practicing driving in poor weather.If you are over 25, you must still complete a practice log, but you are only required to show 14 hours of practice driving. The MVA publishes a “Rookie Driver: New Driver and Coach Practice Guide.” This Guide contains a form that you can use to record your practice hours. You will need to take that log with you when you return to the MVA office for your provisional license.  The purpose of the learner's permit is to give you the opportunity to drive, with a qualified adult in the car, and practice your driving skills before getting a provisional license. You are encouraged to get as much practice as you can during these nine months, so when you go for your driving skills test, you will have had plenty of practice., Because you must drive with a learner's permit for at least nine months, and the earliest you can get it is 15 years and nine months, then the earliest possible age for the provisional license is 16 years and six months old. This provisional license will be the one you use until you turn 18.You must hold the learner's permit for a minimum of 9 months. If you have any driving infractions during this time, your provisional license will be delayed.  You must schedule an appointment for your driving test. Tests are not available on a walk-in basis.   From the MVA home page, www.mva.maryland.gov, select the link to “Locations” to find the MVA offices throughout the state. You can use the link at https://mvascheduling.mdot.state.md.us/ to schedule an appointment online, or you can visit the office where you wish to take the test and schedule an appointment in person.  The driving skills test is a test of your ability to operate a car on the public roadways. If you have logged the required 60 hours of practice time, you should be ready for the driving test.   You should come to the driving test with a vehicle that is in good operating condition and has at least a half-tank of gas. For your own comfort, this should be the vehicle that you spent most of the time practicing in. You and your parent (or other responsible adult whose car you are using) must complete and sign the Certification of Insurance and Authorization to Operate Vehicle. This form certifies that the car you will be using for the driving test is in good condition and is insured., With a provisional license, the following rules apply:You may only drive between 5:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m., unless a licensed driver over 21 years old is with you, or you are driving to or from a job, official school activity, volunteer program or athletic event. You may not drive with passengers under the age of 18, except immediate family members. You may not use any cell phone, whether hands-free or not, while driving.  This is available online or at any MVA office. Even though you may be an experienced driver, it is still recommended that you review the rules of driving in Maryland., When you are ready, you will need to take the following information with you to your nearest MVA facility:   Your out-of-state driver’s license. If you do not have the actual license, you will need to bring a certified copy of your driving record from the Department of Motor Vehicles of your prior state of residence. Proof of identification. You should take with you either a U.S. Passport, or a birth certificate together with a social security card. Proof of Maryland residence. This may be a mortgage, lease, home insurance policy, credit card statements, or similar items. You need to bring two separate items of proof. License fee. The fee for the license is based on age or the number of years driving experience. Check with your nearest MVA office for the amount of the fee for your particular license. The fee is payable by cash, check or credit card., You must be able to demonstrate eyesight in each eye of 20/40 and peripheral vision of 140 degrees. Restricted licenses are available for people with eyesight of 20/70 and peripheral vision of 110 degrees.   You may have you vision screening conducted at the MVA office, or you may have a doctor of your choice conduct the screening and complete the state’s vision form, which you take with you., You may not keep an active, valid driver’s license from more than one state. When you surrender your out-of-state license, you will be issued your Maryland license.	Study the Maryland Driver’s Manual. Be at least 15 years and 9 months old. Gather the documents you will need and go to the MVA office. Take the required tests. Understand what your learner’s permit allows. Complete a Driver’s Education Course.

If you’re driving in the rain on an overcast day or at night, your headlights can help you increase visibility. Even if you’re driving in rain during the day, turning your headlights is a good idea since it allows other vehicles to see you., If your headlights are caked in grime or dirt, they will not shine as brightly as they should. This could reduce your visibility when driving in the rain. To keep your headlights shining properly, wash them with soapy water either on their own or when you wash your car., For a deeper clean, soak a piece of 1000 grit wet/dry sandpaper in cold water. Apply painter’s tape to the area of around the perimeter of your headlights. After 10 minutes, lightly sand the headlights, moving in straight strokes from side-to-side. Spray the headlight with water while you work.Repeat the procedure using 1500 grit sandpaper, then 2000 grit, 2500 grit, and 3000 grit wet/dry sandpaper.	Turn on your headlights. Wash your headlights. Scrub your headlights with sandpaper.
You're going to be cutting the stem in half or in fourths and putting each half or quarter into a separate dye basin. Many rose stems need to be fairly short in order to do this, although not all need to be, especially if you can find a tall glass for your dye basin.  If you want a truly mind-blowing tie-dye experience, cut the rose in fourths. Otherwise, just cut the stem in half. Creating two semi-stems should give you more than enough flower power — don't you worry.   You don't have to cut the stem of the roses all the way up to the bottom of the flower. In most cases, cutting the stem up about halfway will be sufficient for the dyeing process.  Popsicle molds make ideal receptacles for dyes, giving you the opportunity to dye several flowers at once. If you can't find a popsicle mold, consider using two glasses or two vases for each rose.  Only a little amount is necessary, as long as it submerges the bottom of the rose stem.   Try getting colors that match or interact well together. Red and pink work well, as do green and yellow; blue and purple; yellow and orange; green and blue.  After about 8 hours, you'll begin to see some very nice coloring in your rose petals. After 24 hours, your rose petals should be almost a completely different color.  Your roses are ready to present or dry out for posterity!	Trim each rose you're using down to size. Cut each rose stem in half or in fourths. Find a useful dye basin for your dyes. Place different color dyes in each dye basin. Position your rose stems in your dye basin and leave them there until they soak up all the dye. Remove the roses from the dye basin.
You'll need some kind of interface or adapter that takes the signal from the guitar and gets it to the computer.A DI is a small amplifier which takes the (quiet) signal coming from your instrument and amplifies it before it goes into your Macbook. DIs come in either active or passive forms. Most six string guitars are passive by design (no amplification inside the instrument itself requiring a battery) and thus will require an active DI. Some bass guitars are active by design (require a battery in the instrument) and could use a passive DI, but in general active DIs are more common.Although DIs convert instrument signal effectively, they are most commonly used alongside professional recording equipment and thus may not have the appropriate outputs to get into your Macbook. Since you want to avoid adapting your connections / signal multiple times, make sure to find a DI that has the output you want. Search for an "interface". The term interface is often used for more complex options of connecting instruments to computers, and implies a more automatic compatibility with modern laptops via USB or other means. Search "guitar macbook interface" or similar to see some options. These work very similarly to DIs by amplifying the signal on its way to the laptop, but are sometimes sold in conjunction with software suites that help model various classic amplifiers and effects once your signal has made the leap to digital.; , First understand what you have in terms of connections one each side (1/4 inch cable / thunderbolt input, etc...) then consider what exactly you're trying to achieve. Choosing to connect your cables with adapters only (and not use DI or other proper signal converter) when recording results in signal loss and unwanted noise.Note: Older versions of Macbook had a "microphone" 1/8inch input, while newer versions do not.  This is the perfect time for you to check if your guitar is in tune. You don't need an amp cranked to full volume to do this. At a reasonable volume or without amplification at all, listen to the intervals of your instrument or use a tuner to tune it.   If you plan on using a tuner or foot pedal with your instrument, these will also need to be added to your setup. For most basses, this means you will have to connect the foot pedal and tuner to your guitar with correct accompanying attachments before you attach your DI. If you are recording, you may also want to consider using some fretboard lubricant. This will decrease the amount of squeaking caused by sliding your fingers down the strings., Doing this depends on your chosen Di/interface. If you choose to adapt your chord and connect your guitar directly to your Macbook, you'll need appropriate adapters and can expect significant signal loss..   More recent Macbook versions do not have an audio input for a direct connection but older models do. Be careful when you're connecting your cable to your Macbook's audio input! This port can look very similar to your headphone input. In most cases, your headphone input will be indicated by a small headphone or musical note symbol beside the port., This can be an effective space saving technique, since traditional amps can take up a significant amount of space. GarageBand comes pre-loaded with many common amps that you can use to craft the sound of your guitar. Choose from one of these for the amp that best suits your purposes.   You'll have to experiment with GarageBand to find which amp produces the kind of sound suited for your recording. You can also customize amp pre-sets through the amp pop-up menus. Using these, you can change between amp types, models, cabinets, and mics., Though it can feel righteous tearing a solo on your bass at loud volumes, with this kind of setup the extra noise will likely create feedback and distort the sound of your instrument when recording. Protect the quality of your recordings by using headphones.   Even if you don't intend on using your headphones and instead plan on using the readout in your digital audio interface (DAW), which in this case is GarageBand, plugging in headphones can still improve the quality of your recording. A Feedback Protection feature can be enabled in GarageBand from the monitor pop up menu. Toggle this feature "On" in that menu to protect yourself from excess feedback., This can be found in your System Preferences, which can be found on the program dock. You dock is usually located at the bottom of your screen, and System Preferences will likely be represented by a gear icon. In System Preferences, there should be an option labeled "Sound." Open this by clicking and then choose "Input" in the following menu. Here you will be able to change the settings from Internal Microphone to Line In., Navigate to GarageBand on your Macbook. When the program launches, in the upper left hand corner should be the "File" heading. Select this and, in the resulting menu, choose "New" or "New Project." This will open the New Project dialogue box. Here you can choose from many different inputs for your recording; choose the setting that best matches your recording preferences.   Once you have opened a New Project and the associated dialogue box has appeared, options should be available for digital amp users who are not using an external amp. Since you're using headphones, you'll also want to change your from "Monitor Off" to "Monitor On." These settings can be found in the "My Instrument" pop up menu., Your Macbook will remember many of your changed settings, which could create difficult if you plan on video chatting or using a microphone after your recording session. You'll need to return to System Preferences on your program dock and from there path through Sound to the Input menu to return your input from "Line In" back to "Microphone."	Consider a DI box. Consider going direct. Tune your guitar or bass. Link your instrument to your Macbook. Use GarageBand's digital amps. Plug in headphones. Switch your input from Microphone to Line In. Open GarageBand and record. Restore your settings to normal when finished.
Not all furniture is a good candidate for refinishing. Valuable antiques, for instance, should be refinished by a professional, since the refinishing process could devalue the piece if you aren't careful. To choose a piece to refinish, look for these qualities:   Furniture made from sturdy wood. Furniture made with fine wood that could be easily damaged, particle board, or other non-sturdy wood won't do well during the refinishing process. Furniture without too many coats of paint. Taking off layer after layer of paint may not be worth the time it takes. Furniture with smooth, flat faces. If this is your first time, avoid furniture with intricate carvings or turned legs.; , Take a look at the furniture you have chosen to refinish and craft a plan for turning it into the perfect piece for your dining room, front porch or kitchen. You'll need to consider the following questions:   What will it take to refinish the piece? If it's painted, you need paint stripper; if it has an old varnish or finish, you need a thinner finish stripper. How do you want your new piece to look? Will it be painted a new color, or do you want the natural wood to be exposed? You may not know the answer to this question until you see what the wood looks like underneath the old paint or finish. Consider going to furniture stores, browsing online, and talking to experts for ideas on how to create the look you want.  Now that you have a plan, you'll need the following supplies to get the job done:   Protective equipment. You'll need a ventilator (especially if you're working indoors), goggles, chemical-resistant gloves and an apron. To protect your floor or yard, get a chemical-resistant drop cloth as well. Paint stripper and/or finish stripper. If the furniture has paint, you need thick paint stripper to remove it. Otherwise, you just need a thinner finish stripper. Brushes for applying the stripper and scraping tools for removing it. 100 grit sandpaper and/or a power sanding machine, plus a finishing sander. Wood stain in the color of your choice. A protective polyurethane topcoat to seal the stain.  Take off the knobs, pulls, hinges, and other metal hardware to prepare the furniture to be refinished. These items could be ruined by the chemicals used to strip the furniture.   Place the hardware in labeled bags so you remember where everything goes when it's time to place it back on the furniture. Plan to polish the hardware so that it matches your newly refinished piece. Alternatively, you could buy new hardware to spruce up your furniture.	Select the right piece. Make a refinishing plan. Buy refinishing supplies. Remove the furniture's hardware.
In addition to the LED light kit, you’ll need additional electrical wire, preferably in two different colors to help you differentiate the positive and negative battery connections. The job will also require velcro strips (or a permanent adhesive if you prefer), additional 18- or 20-gauge electrical wire, sandpaper, pliers, screwdrivers, soldering equipment (or soldering gel), wire terminal connectors, electrical tape, and an in-line fuse.; , Test the strip by attaching the positive lead wire to the positive terminal on a battery and connecting the negative lead wire to the negative side of the battery terminal. Make sure that each individual strip fully lights.   Your LED kit may come with a battery you can use to test the LED strips. If not, you can use your motorcycle’s battery to test them. Just make sure you disconnect it from the motorcycle first. You can even use a spare nine-volt battery you have around to test the strips.As you’re testing the strips, separate all of the same-size strips into different piles. This will make it easier to use them later. It’s a good idea to disconnect the motorcycle’s battery now even if you don’t need to use it to test the LED strips. In most models of motorcycle, you will find the battery located beneath the seat. By disconnecting the battery, you can test your LED light strips without worry of harming the other motorcycle components that it powers.  Your specific LED kit may come with instructions for where to mount your lights, but if not, use painter’s tape to temporarily attach them to the motorcycle. Try a couple of designs and make sure that you have enough strips to complete the design you want.   Make sure you’re using masking tape since it won’t hurt the paint on your motorcycle at all when you peel it back off., Your LED kit will come with a switch, which should have three leads on the back—positive, negative, and ground. Pick a comfortable location where you will later mount the switch., Once you know exactly where all of your strips need to go, you can go about attaching them to the motorcycle. Many LED kits will come with tape strips already attached, but after sticking them, you’re pretty much stuck with the design. Using thin velcro strips instead can give you plenty of adhesion while also giving you the option to move them at will.If you’re certain you won’t ever want to move the strips, you can naturally use the tape strips that come with them or pick up some strong double-sided tape to use to adhere the strips.  With your positioning picked out and your velcro applied, you can now adhere the strips to your motorcycle. For some spots, such as placing a strip on the underside of a fairing, you might have to remove pieces. These aerodynamic pieces are simply held in place with mounting screws, so you can remove them with a screwdriver and/or socket wrench.When positioning your strip, make sure that you velcro it with the wiring pointing toward the battery. You’ll need to feed all of the wires in this general direction.  Some wiring, such as that behind a fairing, might need to be fished out for you to take care of the electrical portion of the project. You can use rigid line like that from a weed eater or even fishing line. Tie the wiring to the line, then once the fairing is back in place, you can fish it out with the fishing line., Using some additional red (since it’s the positive terminal) electrical wiring, you will need to attach your switch to the positive battery terminal. Solder a ring terminal to one end of the wire. This end will fit over the positive terminal on the battery before you tighten it down. Solder another terminal to the opposite end after you’ve run enough wire to reach the switch.   You should additionally splice your in-line fuse into this portion of the wiring. LEDs draw very little power, but connecting a fuse is always the safe thing to do. The in-line fuse will have a wire coming out of each side. Cut a gap in your wire in a spot where the fuse can fir easily near the battery under your seat. Use your wire strippers to remove maybe 1/2” of the wire sheath and twist together your wire and those from one end of the fuse, then use electrical tape to secure the connection. Do this on both sides, so the fuse runs seamlessly. You will only need a 5-10 amp fuse since the lights draw so little power.If you’re unsure how, you can look up how to Solder, or you can purchase a soldering gel, which allows you to place the wire into the terminal along with the gel, then simply add heat. Your switch will most likely have male terminal connections, so you’ll need a female terminal connections to solder to the wire.For any wire splices that you make sure the project, you can additionally buy heat-shrinking wire wrap to further secure the spliced connection. The wrap slides over the wire on top of the electrical tape (make sure you buy the appropriate size for the wire you’re using), and then you can apply a bit of heat with a lighter (don’t burn the wire to either side of the wrap), which will cause it to shrink down and reinforce the splice., This connection also requires an additional piece of wire with a connection to the switch soldered at one end and a ring terminal soldered at the other. You will connect one end to the ground terminal of your switch, and you will connect the other end to the metal frame of your motorcycle. The ground wire needs to have a metal-on-metal connection, so it’s easiest simply to find a metal portion of the frame with a bolt near the switch location and to put the ring terminal over the bolt and tighten it back down.In order to ensure that it’s a metal-on-metal connection, use a piece of sandpaper to remove any paint that might be on the frame directly where the bolt tightens down to the frame., Run the positive wire from each of your LED strips toward where you have placed your switch. Run the wires tight to the frame, securing them if you need to. Once all of the wires have enough length to reach your switch, use your wire strippers to remove a bit of the wire sheath, twist them all together, and solder them to the terminal you need to connect them to the positive terminal on the switch.If the positive and negative wire sheaths on your LED strips are connected, you can use an X-Acto knife or box cutter in the divot that runs parallel to the two wires to separate them since you will need to run them in opposite directions. If any of the wires end up being too short, you can use some of the additional wiring you have to make it longer. Just use the wire strippers to remove a bit of the end sheaths, twist each bunch together, and secure it well with electrical tape.  Now run all of the negative wiring from your LED strips to the battery. Like you did with the line from the battery to the switch, you’re going to connect them to the battery with a ring terminal. Once you’ve run all of the negative wires from each LED strip to the battery, solder them into the ring terminal that you will attach over the negative terminal of the battery before tightening it down.	Gather everything you’ll need. Test your LED strips. Test locations for your LED strips. Pick a placement for your switch. Attach velcro to your LED strips. Attach the strips to your motorcycle. Fish the unconnected wiring toward the battery. Connect the switch to the positive terminal on the battery. Connect your ground wire. Connect the positive LED strip wires to the switch. Connect the negative LED strip wires to the negative battery terminal.
Record your performances and upload your videos to Youtube. It’s a free video hosting platform that’s easy to join by simply following the prompts. You don’t have to audition or enroll in any formal schooling to upload your performances. If a video goes viral and you build a significant following, you may be able to create a portfolio, be approached for music videos, asked to audition for commercials, or get discovered by a talent agency.Create other free social media accounts to build your name. For example, you can promote your Youtube videos by sharing the link on a free account on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram. Take advantage of these free platforms and post as often as you can to expose your talent to as broad of an audience as you can. Consistency is key to gaining a significant following so post regularly and with frequency. Create a schedule that’s easy for you to meet so your fans know when to check your accounts for new content.; , Post on the walls of famous dancers’ social media profiles. For example, you can comment on a tweet or youtube video a famous dancer posted. You can also partake in dance forums or post on the pages of national or even local dance projects. Becoming a respected voice in the dance community can lead to online fame.You may also learn to shoot, edit, and share videos so people see what you look like and get a sense of your own talent. Think of every post as an audition. Don’t post anything disrespectful or unrepresentative of you as a person and dancer.  You may have to travel very far to audition depending on where you are living. Your expenses may include airfare, food, and your hotel stay. Save responsibly to make sure that your audition fund is never short. An audition may be a process of several days or even several weeks so be prepared to have the funds on hand.Fame may not come immediately so be prepared to have another source of income that supplements your dance career. Create a monthly budget to ensure you have enough money until your dance career takes off.  Learn as many styles as you can from as many famous teachers as you can. Famous teaches often tour or have a residency for workshops and classes. Your opportunity may arise from anywhere but getting to know famous teachers at famous studios may help expedite the process. You may also learn your own style from learning the different philosophies of different instructors.You want teachers who have cachet so that their letters of reference or name alone can immediately open doors within the industry. You also want to learn different styles because it may lead you to fame via a different route. For example, if you want to be a famous ballerina and learn hip hop dance, you may become famous for dancing in a hip hop video rather than in a ballet. Narrow your search for teachers depending on the time and money you have to spend. Some famous teachers may be across the globe. There is no guarantee that studying under someone famous will lead to fame.  You may be capable of doing things other dancers can't. If you are flexible, athletic, and creative, find a signature dance move. There are many dances, like the twist, that become cultural phenomenon. Work with singers or other artists to spread your move.  Whether it's a competition at your city, a national competition, or a tv show like "So You Think You Can Dance", there will be instant fame if you are one of the top finishers. In particular, winning a televised competition may give you an agent or a key role in a production as part of your winnings.  In the beginning, find a dance company or school that offers a suitable program. You want an opportunity to advance technically and network professionally. If you are in school, summer is the best time to focus on your dance career with an intensive program.Some programs are very competitive so be sure to allow yourself at least a six months to a year for preparation.  There may be local, state, federal, or even national funding for specific dance programs that you are applying to. Reach out to funding bodies, like schools or your local arts council, to help fund your initial foray into the industry.Career planning conferences can help you find funding. Workshops can also be a good resource to meet people and learn about any funding opportunities.  Mentors and internships are a great way to get experience. It also allows you to learn from a number of voices within the industry. Even if internships with a dance company is not advertised, attending performances allows you to approach dancers and build a rapport that you can later turn into a mentor type relationship.Internships and mentorships are highly sought after so be prepared to sacrifice without getting any compensation other than experience. Make sure to find the right person as some may see it as an opportunity to exploit you.  Learn to present yourself in the best light. In the beginning you’ll need to pitch yourself to get gigs, apply into programs, or to get an agent. Let people know why you deserve an opportunity.You will also need a great profile for social media, to hand out during networking events, or for agents making a surprise visit to a performance.  Whether you complete a full degree or just a single course, you can always learn and improve your performance. You can learn about kinesiology to help keep your body healthy, music theory to help choreography, or acting and voice lessons for television.There are also a multitude of elements for stagecraft you can learn. Understanding the business may also benefit your financial goals as well. Different institutions may offer different certificates or degrees so contact the institution and talk to a counselor before committing yourself. For example, rather than investing your resources in a marketing degree, you may just want to take courses in social media to help sustain your profile and build your brand with monthly content., Dance and show business are very competitive. Once you find people who support, listen, and understand you as a person, work to maintain those relationships. You will most likely work in a number of projects throughout your career so be respectful of those you work with as you may work with them again., While your mind may sharpen, your body will slow down as you age. Transition into teaching, acting, singing, or another passion that still allows you to use your knowledge of dance and fame. Don't try to force your body to continue dancing if you suffer from an injury or chronic pain.  When you start your career you may be eligible for scholarships, apprenticeships, or fellowships. When you become more established you may be able to pay it forward and establish your own scholarship or fellowship. You may become part of national or local organizations that help fend emerging talent. Part of your legacy is what you pass on to the next generation.Make sure to apply early and double check that you meet all the application criteria when applying for a scholarship, apprenticeship, or fellowship. Think about what you needed when you started out before creating you own scholarship. The criteria can be anything that you think needs your attention. For example, you may start a fund for dancers with special needs because your sister also has special needs.  Keep your focus and continue to dance as much as your body and schedule allow. Your longevity is a direct result of your work ethic. Keeping disciplined and setting new goals will keep things fresh. Immerse yourself in your artistic community to keep inspired by new projects and artists., As you continue your dance career, your body may no longer be able to keep up with the rigors of dancing. Choreography is a natural transition. Collaborate with artists, musicians, actors, and designers to create your own passion projects.Deal with different personalities respectfully. You can always learn from others in different fields. Don’t let your ego get in the way of putting something together.  Your feet are your main tool for dancing so take extra care of them. Some common problems are blisters, bunions, toe splits, broken bones, and floor burn. Don’t neglect your feet and take the proper precautions. Allow any wounds to heal with the right amount of rest or your feet will sustain permanent damage and end your career prematurely., A poor diet, such as candy and fast food, can make you lethargic and affect your performance. Healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, can give you energy and keep your body performing at its peak. Find the right foods to benefit your short term performance and long term health.Energize your morning and get fuel for the day with protein. Snack on hummus, nuts, granola, quinoa, and fruit rather than candy or chips to keep you energized. Have a salad if you are feeling hungry in the evening. It’s also smart to eat food with anti-inflammatory agents like turmeric or ginger., In the beginning, you will need to sacrifice a lot of your time and energy to become famous; however, even when you become famous, you will still need to make sacrifices to ensure you stay relevant. You will need a lot of time to train and recover. Taking care of your mind and body should take precedence over your social time if you want to have a long career.You will need to not only train on your off time but also cross-train, sleep, warm up, cool down, and roll out your muscles and stretch. This is to ensure your body is at its peak physical shape. Don’t compromise your career with an injury that can be easily prevented. There are always new techniques, supplements, and medical advancements to stay on top of., There are many different dance styles. In your off time, learn new forms or improve current styles with a new teacher. Don’t spread yourself too thin. You may only want to focus on a single technique for a specific performance or learn an entire new form as you wait for another gig.Dance is constantly evolving with new sub-genres. You can learn ballet, hip hop, jazz, swing, flamenco, African, modern, interpretive, and all the sub genres in between.  Other forms of movement can greatly benefit your dance techniques. Train in martial arts, yoga, gymnastics, or other athletic forms to help your coordination, strength, and agility. Muscle movements easily translate into dance choreography., Don’t wait for auditions. Create your own opportunities by collaborating with other artists or funding your own projects. You can even post on community bulletin boards to create local, smaller productions. If you can’t find what you’re looking for where you live, create it.Take advantage of social media and market your performances. You can also reach out to peers and contemporaries to start a new project or find out if they are working on anything that you can be a part of.  Becoming a famous dancer is extremely difficult even if you have the talent and natural ability. Hard work can be derailed without the proper mindset. Prepare yourself for the injuries, long hours, and emotions needed to beat the odds.Put in extra hours. If you are indispensable, you can ensure a long career. Long hours of work and the right demeanor can endear you to both cast and crew. You can also learn more things beyond the day’s production material.Don’t disrupt practice, class, or a performance with a negative attitude. If you are tired or grumpy, fall back on your support system and don’t take it out on others.  Have humility and learn from your mistakes and failures. Experience is the best teacher and not every performance will be perfect; some may even be terrible. Take these opportunities to learn, improve, and build your character.Be positive. Focus only on what you can control as anxiety about your future or depression about past failures can become toxic. Your future is bright as long as you continue to work hard, be humble, and respect the process. The physical demands of your career will be difficult to deal with on their own so don’t allow a bad attitude to make things even worse.Be open. Watch any performance and participate in discussions and workshops. You can also supplement your experience by reading articles and meeting people. While stage time is the best teacher, you can also learn from peers and friends that have a different perspective.Everyone makes mistakes and failure will happen. Find the lesson and keep pushing forward after things don’t go as you would have liked.  Find a lesson in the experience of working with difficult people. Even the best dancers aren’t perfect. You can learn from anything especially your most difficult situations.Dance every opportunity as if it’s your last. You career can be cut short from anything including going bankrupt, falling ill, getting injured, or falling in love. Express your passion with each performance. It doesn’t matter who your audience is as long as you embody your passion for dance.You never know who is watching. A passionate performance can garner you an agent or new career opportunity. If you post it online, it could become viral and increase your fame.  People in the public eye expose themselves to criticism. Remember that everyone has their own opinion and that you won’t be able to please everyone. You may even find critics among family, friends, peers, and the media. Do what you feel is right and block out the noise.At the end of the day, if you can tell yourself that you’ve given 100%, the reviews don’t matter. You are doing this for yourself and not for anyone else. While fame may be a product of good reviews, you can also become famous for a number of different reasons. Don’t get involved in drama or politics. As you begin to climb the ranks of fame, you may encounter both toxic individuals and situations. Focus on yourself and avoid anyone who is trying to use you or bring you down. Work on your craft and remain focused on what makes you happiest., Fame and fortune are fleeting. It takes a lot of sacrifice to reach the upper echelon of this very competitive industry. As you become more famous, stay grounded and remember that there’s more to life than fame and dancing., Confidence comes with practice. All the best dancers have put in numerous hours of work to get to their level. Push yourself to improve through the long hours. You may need a lot of travel and do a lot of press. Find time to continue to practice despite a busy schedule filled with media obligations.Stay in the moment. There’s no point in dwelling on mistakes during a poor performance or missed opportunities. It’s easy to get distracted and repeat the same mistake during the performance if you dwell on it. Fall back on the fundamentals of technique and treat each performance as its own.

Whenever you notice weeds start to emerge, use a stirrup hoe, garden tiller, or rake to disturb the soil around their roots. Exposing their roots, especially on a dry, hot day, can cause the weeds to dry up and die. Cultivating further than a couple inches (3-5 centimeters) is not recommended, as it can damage vegetable roots and bring buried weed seeds to the surface.This method will be less effective if the weeds are allowed to grow larger.  Mulch refers to any material covering the soil surface, which helps block new plants from emerging. Add a 2–4 inch (5–10 cm) layer of dead leaves, seed-free straw, or grass clippings to serve as mulch, but leave bare areas 1 inch (2.5 cm) around each desirable plant to allow air circulation.   Mulch also helps retain soil moisture and heat. As an insulator, it can help keep plants cool in hot temperatures, and warm in cooler temperatures. Avoid wood chips, bark chips, or sawdust, as they may have lingering effects that prohibit seed growth. These types of mulch may be appropriate for use in area of your gardens without vegetables or other annual plants. If you are using wood then make sure to inspect it for parasites and diseases. You don't want to introduce these to your garden.  Black-and-white newspaper can be used as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly mulch to prevent weed growth, but it is only effective in certain conditions. This relatively recent practice requires more study, but appears to require well-draining soil, and frequent cultivation as described above. Apply it as you would organic mulch, described above.   Do not use colored ink pages, which may contain toxic materials that can harm the soil and vegetable plants. In windy conditions, weigh the newspaper down with grass clippings or other material.  Always research a herbicide's effect on your specific vegetables and nearby plants before using, and select one that targets your type of weed (such as grass or broad-leaf weeds). Here is some information to start with, concerning pre-emergent herbicides to use before the weeds have sprouted:   Products containing DCPA, such as Dacthal, rarely harm most vegetables.Corn gluten meal is sometimes used as organic weed control, applied in a garden with vegetables 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) tall and no weeds present.It is unclear how effective this is compared to other options, but can double as a fertilizer as well.  Rather than leave your garden bare after harvesting, plant a cover crop to prevent undesirable plants from going wild. Grow a hardy winter/autumn crop such as annual rye grass, buckwheat, or winter rye for this purpose.Be prepared to fertilize and harvest this crop if you go with this plan.A dense crop cover will keep weeds from getting started in your garden. When you cut the cover crop, you can even leave the trimmings in your garden as a green manure. Look up crop rotation or crop combination recommendations for your specific vegetables, so your soil next year will have the correct nutrients to encourage vegetable growth.	Cultivate the soil shallowly and regularly. Apply an organic mulch to reduce weed growth. Consider using newspaper as a mulch. Research pre-emergent herbicide options. Use cover crops outside the growing season.
If you are only expecting 20 or 30 people for an audition, even your garage may do. If you need a larger space, try renting out hotels or venues function rooms. These often are quite cheap to rent during the day, which is the most likely time to hold your auditions.; ,   If you're auditioning people to become members of a band, you may need to supply amps, leads, microphones etc. If you need a drummer for a band, you will most certainly need to have a drum kit available. Not many drummers will cart their expensive kits to an audition. Other instruments won't be necessary as most people will only play their own instruments If you're auditioning an actor or singer for a musical, you may need microphones also, and a stereo or PA to play music through. But more importantly you may need someone to play out parts with them. This should not be too difficult to organise if you are in charge of hiring people!  ,   Open Auditions are where you have a start time for auditions and anyone can turn up. This is done on a first come first serve basis. Set Auditions are where you do not list the time or location of your auditions on your advertisements. You just put a contact number up, and when people ring you, you give them more information and a specific time and date for their audition. Though this sounds more complicated, this is often easier and seems better organised. Also, you know how many people are going to show up before they arrive. Posters should follow this guide: AUDITIONS What type(s) of performer is required Age and sex requirements Time and Date (optional) Length of audition Contact number, website and email    , If you're not artistic/confident enough to make your own get them professionally done. Posters put up in venues, music shops, colleges and schools, drama clubs etc. are often the most effective. But there's no harm in placing advertisements in local papers. Another way to guarantee auditions is to ring Talent Agencies and Agents which can be found in your Yellow Pages. Only good performers are picked up by these businesses. Make sure to be safe about where you decide to put up your advertisements. ,, Also ask them to bring passport style, photos so when you're debating which to accept afterwards you will remember every person. This form should have:     Name Phone Number Address Email Address Age    , Often the most talented are the busiest! So try to accommodate them in a separate/private audition.  The panel should always consist of at least two people, at least one man and one woman, unless you are running an all male or all female band. This looks more professional and one on one auditions can be disconcerting. ,, Don't give away your decision either and tell every person auditioning that you'll get back to them.	Find a place large enough to hold the audition. Get the equipment you require. Decide whether you are going to hold 'open' or 'set' auditions. Make your advertisements. Set an exact time limit on a person's performance and make sure they know this before they come.  , If they are auditioning for a part in a film or play, provide them with a script as soon as they decide that they would like to audition.  , Create forms for when people arrive. Try to accept every person that rings for an audition, even if they can't make in on your assigned day. Get together a panel of interviewers, and a few people to organise queues etc, if holding a large audition. Get the organisers to make a few refreshments for the people auditioning, this shows you care!  ,Make sure the place where the people are auditioning is separate from the people waiting to interview, this helps calm nerves and will make it more fair  , Always give constructive criticism if you have any but don't be mean. Once the auditions are over, make your decisions and inform the person you've accepted first, then ring/email each person saying that you're sorry but that you'll keep their form in case another opening becomes available.
The required materials for this process are:  Paint Tool SAI A drawing tablet with pen or a mouse A computer Reference images (either self-taken photos or images found online); , If a box appears asking permission to open it, say yes., Any size canvas will work, but you can always go bigger than necessary and then crop it later. The resolution should be at either 300dpi, which is printing resolution or 72dpi which is digital resolution. You can also name your file here, but this can be done later when saving., This will be a horizontal line across the entirety of the canvas.  This will help you determine what the eye should focus on. To help you determine the eye level, here are some examples:  If you want to focus on the layout of a room or location, choose an eye level that is near the top of the canvas. If you want to focus on the details of the ceiling of buildings, forests, or caves, then the eye level should be near the ground. If you want it to be from the perspective of a person, then base it on the relative height of the objects in the background.  This well help determine the sizes of objects in comparison to one another. There should be at least one vanishing point, but there can be more based on the perspective you want.,, This will make it easier to paint and you can fix issues that appeared in the rough sketch such as perspective issues or add new components in., You can do this on one of the sketch layers. Draw arrows starting at the direction of the light source and going away from it, stopping when it hits an object in the sketch., You can do this by using either the eyedropper and altering the color or just your eye. You can either place splotches of the color on a new layer or click the swatches or scratch pad icons for the menu., This color will set the mood for the entire piece. This color can be the sky if you are doing an outdoor piece or the darkest color of the palette for a cave or forest background., If you need to, you can do different types of objects on separate layers, or break it into background, midground, and foreground. In the image, I decided to do different types of objects. I put this all into a folder so I could hide the layers easier., The shading will be based on the light source in step 1 of the coloring section., Do this as much as you see fit with as small of a brush as you think will best work. Don’t be afraid to experiment with brush types and sizes., Much like step 6 in the coloring section, experiment and play around with it. You can always click undo. I added a slight orange tint to the image., This can be done by clicking file and then save. It defaults as a .SAI file. This will keep all layers in case editing needs to be done. Change the file name if you want., This will be depending on if you chose to keep it digital or plan on printing it. Prints are better if saved as .jpeg while digital pieces are better as .png files. The file name from step 1 of exporting should still be there so you would most likely not need to rename it.	Gather the materials. Open Paint Tool SAI by clicking the icon on the desktop or pinned on the toolbar.  Create a new canvas by clicking file then new canvas.  Determine the eye level.  Sketch a perspective grid.  Draw out a rough sketch of how you want things laid out. ,  On a new layer, draw a neater sketch over the rough sketch.  Determine where the light source is.  Pick out your color palette.  Add a  layer and drag it to the bottom of the layers list and fill it with a flat color.  Add flats for your colors on a layer above your sketch.  Using either the preserve opacity tool or creating new layers and using the clipping tool, add shading.  Add detail using a fine brush. Add effects to the canvas such as texture or an overall tinting. Save the image as a .SAI file. Save again as either a .jpeg or .png file.
It takes a long time to get a sizeable philodendron from a seed, but you can buy them from online gardening suppliers or personally collect them during blooming time. Put the seeds about 1/3 of an inch (1 centimeter) deep in nutritious breeding soil and cover them lightly. Spray the soil regularly to keep it moist.Philodendron seeds do not need to be soaked prior to planting. The seeds will take about 2 to 8 weeks to germinate when the temperature of the soil is kept between 68 and 73 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 23 degrees Celsius). When the seedlings sprout and become sturdy enough to handle, move each one to a small pot of its own to foster strong root development.; , If you know someone who has a healthy philodendron or you find one growing wild, you can take a stem cutting from it. Make sure to cut at least 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) below a joint in a leaf stem and remove lower leaves near the cut. Place the cutting in a jar filled with water near medium light. When roots appear, plant the cutting in a small pot with potting soil.Orchid soil (with bark pieces) and a mixture of sphagnum peat and vermiculite or a mixture of sand and turf/compost can provide good nutrition for your newly planted cutting.It’s important to keep the cutting watered regularly. Be sure there are drainage holes in the bottom of your pot, so that the cutting is protected from over-watering.  Air-layering can be used when the philodendron you want to propagate from is too mature or thick to cut. Start by cutting halfway through a mature branch at a 45 degree angle. Insert a small piece of plastic (like from a bottle) in the semi-cut, wrap the cut site with a moist ball of moss, and then wrap and tie the moss onto the stem using plastic wrap and string.In about 2 weeks, you’ll see roots forming in the moss. You may need to tie the semi-cut branch to a support if it’s unable to support itself. Once you notice a healthy root system growing into the moss, you will be able to sever the stem about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from the air-layering site. Remove the plastic wrap and place the rooted moss ball into a small pot with rich soil. Make sure the pot has good drainage.  If you want to enjoy a full-bodied philodendron right away, visit a local greenhouse and buy one there. There are many different varieties to choose from, and most of them aren’t expensive. Small philodendrons shouldn’t cost more than $10 USD, and they’ll come with their own custom care instructions.	Start from seeds. Propagate from stem cuttings. Air-layer from another plant. Buy one from a greenhouse.
This diagram shows how the pieces of the straw will be used to make the orca. The short end will be the tail, while the two long, thin pieces will be the stand (stick in the diagram) and the backbone. You'll fold the long, wide pieces to make the body of the orca. It might help you to print this off to follow. Additionally, you might want to use a straw with colored lines running down the side for your first try.  For now, keep the bend in the closed position.        Flatten the straw. Press down on each side of the bend to flatten the straw, running your fingers over the bend a few times. Do not flatten the bend itself.  Pinch the straw flat between your thumb and forefinger with one hand. With the other hand, use scissors to cut out your first piece. With the straw flat, cut a thin strip off one side, making sure you cut both layers of the straw. (If you're using a lined straw, it might be useful to flatten the straw such that the thin backbone and stand pieces contain the lines.)        Stop cutting when you reach the straw bend.       Cut out another thin strip on the other side of the flattened straw.       Again, don't cut along the edge itself but right next to it. You should be cutting two layers of straw, not one.       There will be four "sticks" once you're done with cutting – two thin sticks and two wide sticks.  First, take one of the thin sticks and bend it so that it's at a 90-degree angle to the straw. This stick will be the stand. The other thin stick will be the backbone.        Grab one of the wide sticks and pull it under the backbone, then up and back down through the loop created.       Pull the knot created by the wide stick all the way up to the bend in the straw. Tug gently on the bottom of the wide stick to tighten.  As with the first wide stick, pull it under the backbone, then up and back down through the loop created.        Move the knot up to the bend in the straw, layering on top of the first knot created with the other wide stick. Tug gently on the bottom of the wide stick to tighten the knot. Both wide sticks and the stand should be pointing in the same direction.       Gently fold the wide sticks upward on their respective sides. This will position them away from the stand slightly, so that you can keep tying the body of the orca.       Begin tying again. Grab the first wide stick you tied. Pull it under the backbone, then pull up and draw back down through the loop created.       Tug gently on the wide strip to tighten the knot once it's at the bend in the straw.  Grab the second wide strip. Pull it under the backbone, then upward and back down through the loop created.        Tug gently on the wide strip to tighten the knot once it's at the bend in the straw.       Again, both wide strips and the stand should be facing the same direction.  Fold the two wide strips upward and away from the stand again.        Fold the first wide stick, then the other, in the same motion - looping under the backbone, then up and pulling down through the loop.  The fins on each side of the orca are called pectoral fins, or pec fins, and they're used for steering.       Back view       Position the orca standing on the two wide sticks left from folding and tying in the previous steps. You might have to bend the sticks a bit to get them into the right position.       Cut a small curved half moon on one fin.       Cut the same shape on the other side.       Pull away the pieces around the curved cuts.       Feather cut down the length of each pectoral fin.  Position the orca in your hands, with the short part of the straw away from your hold.        Bend the short part of the straw around to mold the body shape.         Cut a triangle into the short end of the straw. Remove the part that becomes unattached.       As with the pectoral fin, feather cut the tail once it's in shape.  Remove the remaining backbone around which you folded the wide sticks by cutting.        Admire your completed orca.  You can stick small googly eyes onto the head using a tiny drop of glue.	Note the terminology applying to each piece of the straw.  Locate the bend in the straw.  Cut out the backbone and stand.  Begin tying the body of the orca.  Tie the other wide stick.  Tie the other wide strip again.  Repeat the knotting and tightening process three to four times.  Create the pectoral fins.  Create the bend in the body.  Cut the tail fin.  Cut the backbone.  Add eyes.

Disturbing, playing with or breaking an ant mound will enrage the fire ants, who will respond by defending what is, after all, their home. If you can, rope the area off to prevent people from accidentally walking into the area. If you have pets and young children, consider a way to block off the area until you can deal with it properly.; , Explain where they are in the yard and ask everyone to stay away from the area until the ant problem has been dealt with.  One of the most effective ways to prevent further infestations is to engage in a neighborhood-wide prevention program in which every person who has the problem deals with it. This will reduce the likelihood of the fire ants returning to treat any part of the area as a new home.  There are many possible ways of dealing with the fire ants. You can call in a professional who will likely take care of everything, or you can try one of the DIY methods suggested in the following steps.  Granular products, such as those containing the active ingredient fipronil, are undetectable to fire ants. Fipronil blocks the inhibitory nervous system of fire ants. It is a dual-use treatment and can be used as a preventative or a curative method, providing season-long control of treated areas. Fipronil products are ideal for fire ant treatment because one application should last an entire season. It kills the existing fire ants and prevents new colonies from forming.   Granules are spread with a broadcast or drop spreader and then watered to release the active ingredients into the soil where they kill fire ant queens and foraging ants.  Sprays are an effective, yet costly treatment option. The aerosol spray comes in a can equipped with a rod that is placed within the mound to distribute the chemicals. Once sprayed, fire ants die immediately. When treating with sprays, wear protective clothing, as treatment involves close contact with the fire ant mound.  Dusts are long-lasting and highly-repellent. They are ideal if moisture conditions permit. Dusts are applied by evenly sprinkling dust over the fire ant mound. The dust particles then stick to the bodies of ants as they walk through treated soil; all ants that contact the dust die.  Baits are insecticides that have been mixed with ant attractants. Worker ants carry bait particles back to the mound and feed them to the queen, and the colony cannot survive without the queen. Baits are fairly slow working and do not work in wet environments.        Step two - follow by using a fipronil broadcast, for year long control.  Apparently ants don't like cornmeal. So it's time to make fresh cornmeal! This can work for both outdoors and indoors but beware––it's rather messy.   Get some fresh corn (seeds) and put them in the mixer, turn it on and keep it on 'till it is fresh cornmeal.       Pour a cup of cornmeal where the ants are, the ants will relocate. Put the cornmeal around your house if it is indoors, if you are outdoors just place some more cornmeal within a few feet so they don't relocate further away.       This is a safe way to prevent the stings and getting the ants out. You may remove the cornmeal once you start noticing the ants are gone.	Do not disturb the mound in any way. Tell family members and visitors that you have fire ants. Tell your neighbors about the infestation. Select a pest control method to treat the infestation. Use granular products. Use a spray. Use dusts. Place down baits. Use the two-step method:   Step one – Use indoxacarb bait for fast acting control of mounds. Use cornmeal.
Just how “junky” is it? A junked vehicle is one that is so damaged and beyond repair that it makes the most sense to just sell it for parts.Can the car be driven or is it completely immovable? Note any areas of severe damage. Determine if there are any valuable parts to your car, such as a GPS system, tires in good condition, or the alternator.Write down everything you see and observe, so that you can give the junkyards an accurate description of the car you’re selling.; , The Kelley Blue Book is a respected and widely-used resource for vehicle valuation.Of course, the actual amount of money you can expect for your car will be much less than the Blue Book value, as you’ve clearly deemed it “junk” rather than in good condition. This is simply a way to get a general idea about how much the pristine version of the same make and model car is selling for.   If you are knowledgeable about car repair, you can take the Kelley Blue Book price and subtract all the costs of potential repairs to get a general idea of how much money you should expect when you sell it., You need your title to prove that you own the car. Most junkyards will not buy your car unless you can prove that it’s yours to sell. When you transfer it to the junkyard, you will need to sign the title over to them to get it officially off your hands. If you don't sign over the title of the car, you will technically still own it despite having nothing to do with it., It’s easy to forget an old iPod in the glovebox or a notebook stuffed in the seat pocket. Open your trunk, check under your floor mats, and slide your hands under all the seats. Make sure that you’ve removed every personal item from the car before you sell it.This includes your license plates. These are easily forgotten, but it’s important to remove them from your car before you part with it.  Just like with all other car-related issues, the DMV of each state handles the process of relinquishing junk cars differently. When you’re ready to get rid of your junk car, make sure to research the regulations of your particular state. A quick Google search for “Salvaged Vehicle Regulations” and the name of your state will get you started!, You shouldn’t do this until you have assessed the details of the car you’re selling. You need to describe the vehicle thoroughly so that they can give you an accurate quote of how much they’ll pay you for it.Keep a running list of the different amounts you’re quoted by different junkyards so that you can compare your options.  Some junkyards will dismantle the cars themselves. Others will pay you more money if you do it yourself and save them the time. Ask them if they pay more if you are able to drive the car to their lot, versus if they have to come pick it up with a tow truck. Ask them exactly what paperwork they will need to see from you. Make sure you know the ins and outs of each junkyard., If you aren’t desperate to get every penny out of your car, you can choose the most convenient option. A junkyard across town may give you a higher offer if you drive it all the way to them, but you may opt for a lesser offer if they’re willing to tow your unreliable junk car. If you aren’t experienced in working with cars hands-on, it’s probably not wise to try to dismantle the car yourself for a few extra bucks. Consider which option works best for you, while still bringing you a reasonable amount of money.  Some junkyards will give you more money if you save them the time and labor by delivering the car to them.Additionally, junkyards will pay more for a car that can still be driven and was driven recently, so driving it to the junkyard will up your cars value.  This is the most convenient option. They’ll come to wherever you’re located, pick up your car, and pay you on the spot. If your car can’t be driven, this is absolutely your best bet. After you’ve gotten prices from different junk removal companies, you can choose the best one.   Sometimes junkyards will quote you a price, and then lower it significantly once they’ve already loaded the car onto the tow truck. This is why it is so important to know your cars value and stick to your guns. Don’t fight the junk car towers over a few dollars, but stick to your guns if they try to offer you something much lower than what you were previously told.  The exact protocol differs by state, but typically you need to return the license plates to the DMV in order to cancel your registration. The junkyard should have this information available for you, so ask them what is expected of you when you hand off your vehicle. The Internet is also an excellent resource, and the DMV website for your state should give you an exact procedure for canceling your registration and returning your plates.	Take inventory of the vehicle. Use the Kelley Blue Book to determine the value of your car in good condition. Locate the title of the car. Remove your personal items. Check your states junked vehicle requirements. Call around to different salvage yards and junkyards in your area. Ask the junkyard their protocol for taking junk cars. Compare the pros & cons of your options. Drive or tow the car to the junkyard, if you are able and feel comfortable doing so. Arrange for the junkyard to pick up your car. Return the license plates and cancel your registration.
,,, This song is very basic and uses down strums only. After learning all of the four basic power chords, you have to learn the sections. Blitzkrieg Bop only has two sections, a verse and a chorus. Listen to the song to see how the music changes during these parts.   The verse. The verse is played by down strumming the first power chord eight times, switching and playing the second power chord three times then sliding up to play the fourth power chord five times. Repeat this pattern three times. On the fourth time, you play the pattern slightly differently. You down strum the first power chord four times, switch to the second power chord and hit it four times and then switch back to the first power chord and hit it eight times. You should start to hear the verse. Make small adjustments to the timing if necessary. The chorus. The chorus is played by down strumming the fourth power chord sixteen times then sliding down to the first power chord (two frets down) and hitting it eight times. Switch to the second power chord and hit it three times then switch back to the first power chord and hit it five times. On the second time round, hit the fourth power chord sixteen times, slide down to the first power chord and hit it eight times, switch to the second power chord and hit it three times then slide up the the third power chord (two frets up) and hit it five times.

The shredder will dull and become less efficient. Small hard objects can also get stuck and jam the rotating parts. Each garbage disposal has its own capacity for hard objects. The more expensive models of the same brand tend to have higher hardness capacities. The instruction manual usually specifies a list of objects to avoid. You can also gain experience with your own garbage disposal. Strong vegetable fibres can jam some garbage disposals, as well. If something may be harder than what the disposal handles, just put it in your trash can or think about setting up a worm composting bin. Some items to avoid are:   hard shells from shrimp, crabs and other shellfish unpopped popcorn kernels hard bones; , Both can cause particularly stubborn drain blockages (fibers get tangled, and starches get thick). The following items should be put in the disposal in minimal increments, preferably cut into small pieces, or not at all:   banana peels celery potato peelings corn husk or corn cobs artichokes coffee grounds (in quantity) or coffee filters fruit pits and hard seeds from things like avocados or peaches onion skins (unless you're especially careful to completely remove the thin membranes of each, which can wrap around the shredder ring) egg shells should not be put in the disposal as they turn into a sand-like substance that clogs piping. , Common sense will go a long way, but here are some examples of items to avoid:   twist ties, pull tabs, rubber bands glass, screws, nails, utensils cigarette butts or bottle caps, paper, plastic, or other trash fabric, string, rags, or sponges plant or flower clippings children's toys hair grease  , If they are too large, like the skins of melons, cut them into smaller pieces and put them one at a time into the disposal instead of trying to shove a large amount in at once.   If you find yourself with a lot of larger pieces to cut up, it may be best to place them in the compost or trash instead.  Keep disposer and water running for 30 to 60 seconds AFTER the waste matter has cleared your drain. The waste still has a distance to go. Cold water keeps the motor, bearings and shredder assembly from overheating. It also lets the waste go down easier because the water is pushing it down. Don't use hot water, because it can melt fat and allow it to re-solidify as a blockage further down in the drain.    With the disposal off, clean the inner side of the rubber in the center of the sink leading to the disposal. It gets very dirty, and gives off an odor when not cleaned. Just wipe it with a paper towel. Throw some ice down once in a while. While ice will not sharpen the shredders (as is commonly believed) it does knock off any debris buildup on the sharp edges that keeps them from grinding food properly. For better results, make special ice cubes from pure lemon juice or vinegar, or alternate with biodegradable cleanser (label them in your freezer!) Cover and seal ice trays used in your freezer for cleanser, and do not reuse trays for food or drink after having been used for cleanser. While using the disposal, be sure to run cold water at the same time. Dispose orange peels, or any citrus rinds, to freshen the disposal and keep it smelling clean, but cut them into slices first as large pieces of citrus peel, e.g. half a lime, can jam a disposal. You can also use pieces of citrus fruit that may be too old to consume, as long as they're not too spoiled to smell nice. You can freeze these pieces first, if you wish.	Keep anything too hard out of the disposal. Do not put fibrous or starchy items in the disposal. All the above are easily composted - see the composting note and link below.  , Avoid placing trash or hard items down the disposal. Cut large items into smaller pieces. Run cold water while the disposal is on. Clean it regularly.

A suit, a tie, and sandshoes. He's the charming bloke in a tight suit who taught me how to get the ladies.  You'll need to make this suit tight on you. Only allow about one or two inches of space when sizing it. For example, if you've got a size 36" chest, you need a 38" chest on your suit. He never buttoned all four buttons, usually two or three - except in the two part story 'Silence in The Library/Forest of The Dead', which was with the blue suit.  You basically want something thin, in a colour palette of blue and either brown or burgundy (for the brown or blue suit respectively), and not overly patterned. Alternatively, you could go without one - if you're going to go this route, spread the collar over your jacket lapel. An undershirt would complete the open neck look.  He always wore slim fitting shirts. With the brown suit, he usually wore solid dark blue or light blue coloured dress shirts (he has also worn a light grey, tan, and brown shirt on occasion) (his dark blue shirts are not navy, as navy blue is far darker than the dark blue shirts he wears). With the blue suit, he wore either wine, dark burgundy, or light blue coloured dress shirts. It should be noted he never wore a white dress shirt with his pinstripe suits, as Louise Paige, the costume designer for David's whole run, felt that white was a very high contrast, given the nature of his suits, so if it looks white (such as in a promotional image), it's actually a very light blue.  With the brown suit, he wore cream (not white!!!) Chuck Taylors (they looked like they were falling apart a little bit, so try to give them that look, or actually beat up a pair of Chucks). With the blue suit, he wore maroon (again, not red!!!) Chuck Taylors (These were also kind of dirty and beaten up). However, in the episodes 'Fear Her', 'Love and Monsters', 'Rise of The Cybermen' and 'The Impossible Planet', he wore black converse with his brown suit.  The hair is a little bit messy. Try for a fringe, or the more common sticking up hairstyle.  The bow tie was quite wide on the ends (more so than in the middle) and was self tie, however a pre tied works just as well. He wore this outfit in the episodes "Voyage Of The Damned", "The Lazarus Experiment", and "Rise Of The Cybermen/The Age of Steel.", This guy has more accessories than Tom Baker! You'll need a pair of 3-D glasses (from the episode "Doomsday"), a clear green plastic water pistol (from "The Fires of Pompeii"), a weird "Timey-wimey" detector (from "Blink"), a pair of rectangular plastic frame glasses (like the kind hipsters use), psychic paper (multiple episodes), and a sonic screwdriver.  "There's an old Earth saying, Captain. A phrase of great power and wisdom and consolation to the soul in times of need. Allons-y!!!" - Tenth Doctor (The End of Time Part 2, 2010)	Take a look at David Tennant's dress sense. Get either a blue or brown pinstripe suit with four buttons (preferably blue pinstripes for the brown suit, and rust pinstripes for the blue suit). Add a tie - the different ones he had varied, so you have a few choices. Add a shirt. Get the right shoes. Style your hair just right. Alternatively, if you have a black tie event you are attending and would like to dress like the Tenth Doctor, I'd suggest getting a black, single button tuxedo with notch lapels, and wearing a white dress shirt with a black bow tie and black high top converse/Chuck Taylors (with a white sole, laces and stitching). Amp it up with accessories. You're done.
The flush handle is just one part of the system called the 'flush mechanism', which allows water to flow from the tank to the bowl in a way that creates a flush. Problems that you notice in the handle are often due to a part else where in the mechanism, so its important to know how they all fit together. So go ahead and carefully remove the tank lid and peek in. There are 5 parts that make up the flush mechanism for you to identify.   The Flush Handle is what you push down on to create a flush. It is the effort arm of the flush lever. The Trip Lever is the bar inside the tank, and attached to the Flush Handle. Pushing down on the handle makes the Trip Lever pull up on Flapper Chain. It is the load arm of the flush lever. The Flush Lever Nut is the lock nut inside the tank that holds the Flush Lever in place where it enters the tank. The Flapper Chain is the chain that connects the Trip Lever to the Flapper. When the Trip Lever is raised, the chain allows it to pull on the Flapper. The Flapper is the part covering the Flapper Valve near the bottom of the tank. It is pulled up by the Trip Lever to let just enough water flow through the valve.; , The problem you feel or see in the handle is very rarely a problem with the handle itself. Look at how your handle sticks out of the tank. If it looks too far in or out, or if it is wobbly, you might either have the wrong type of flush lever or a loose flush lever nut. The handle will be mounted one of six ways: on the front, side, or corner of the tank, and may be on the left or right side. If your flush lever seems to fit incorrectly, check the Handle product name or number online to see if it is compatible with your mount and tank type.  Grasp the lock nut with your hand, and, from your perspective, turn it clockwise, from your left to your right, until it feels tight. This will keep your flush lever from becoming wobbly, which could cause an incomplete flush. If it is broken or stripped, it will have to be replaced.  This may seem like common knowledge to some, but every plumber has forgotten this step at least once. Find the water shutoff valve, which is the almost always near the floor to the left of the toilet when you are facing it. Turn its head clockwise, from left to right, until it stops to shut off water supply to the toilet.  Now that the water supply is off, no more water should flow in to refill your tank. Press on the flush handle to let most of the water out into the bowl. There will be some left in the bottom of the tank however, as the flapper valve is not on the floor of the tank. You can remove this water by soaking it up with sponges or towels, or by using a siphon of some sort. You now have full access to your tank system and a decreased risk of soaking your bathroom.  There are a few types of flapper chains, but they all serve the same basic function. Make sure that it is connected to flapper and trip lever, it is not broken, and none of its links are bent out of shape. If the links have been bent, try to bend them back carefully with needle nose pliers. If it has simply come disconnected, find the hook or closing loop connector on the ends. Connect the more angled hook or the closing loop to one of the holes in the Lever, and the other end to the loop on the flapper. Move the Lever connector to different holes until you get as close as possible to about a half inch, or 1.27 cm, of slack. If the flapper chain has a flapper chain float, make sure its attached to the chain by the circle clips on either side of it. Adjust it closer to the flapper to gradually increase the size and duration of the flush it they are normally to short or weak.  Make sure the lever is not notably too long, broken, or bent up and down. Some Trip Levers are meant to be trimmed down or bent horizontally in order to fit effectively in different types of tanks. If it is metal and bent, try to bend it back with a pair of pliers or an adjustable wrench. If it is plastic and too long, you can try to trim it down with a hacksaw. If, while the Lever is at rest, the chain is taught still, attempt to bend the Lever closer or you must replace the lever or chain. Push the Handle down and watch how the rising of the Lever affects the chain and flapper. The chain should start slightly slack, and become taught after the lever raises approximately a half of an inch. After that, the flapper should raise with the lever.  If, by this time, you are still having an issue with water level, refill speed, flush size, or the chain not moving, the problem, if it lies withing the flush mechanism, will most certainly lie within the Flapper. There are a multitude of Flappers, but they all end up with the same problems and require the same fix. If the tank water level is constantly low, takes a very long time to refill, or flushes are incomplete, your flapper might be leaking. If the these problems occur when the chain is slack and the flapper is at rest, you should first examine and adjust the refill mechanism for the long refills and low tank water level, but replace the flapper is they persist.  Make sure you check new parts for compatibility within the remaining parts and toilet. There may be parts that classify as 'OEM', standing for 'Original Equipment Manufacturer' and 'will-fit'. If it is an OEM, it means that the toilet company for one toilet brand decided to have it incorporated with an existing part from a part manager under the toilet company's brand. If it is will-fit, the company of that brand made that product specifically for that brand of toilet. This means that you can find OEM parts to be almost identical and cheaper than the will-fit parts. However, the will-fit parts sometimes out perform the OEM part. If you have a choice, decide upon which would be best.  Now that you have successfully adjusted and improved your flush system, its time to allow the water to flow through it once again., Toilets aren't clean, you know?	Look at the bigger picture. Examine your flush handle. Examine the flush lever nut. Shut off the water supply. Drain the water. Examine the flapper chain. Examine the trip lever. Examine the flapper. Buy and install replacement parts. Turn the water supply on. Wash your hands.
Not every type of houseplant has the same watering needs, so educate yourself on the plants you have or are thinking of buying. Don’t assume that every plant wants 1 quart of water every two days because all of your plants won’t thrive like that.Some may prefer to have their soil fairly dry most of the time, while others need it moist. Some may need the soil to dry out in between waterings.; , Although it may be easiest to water on a set routine that you have decided, plants are not likely to thrive when watered this way. So rather than watering every two days, get a feel for how often your plant needs water. Check the soil consistently and learn how often it tends to dry out and water on that schedule.Even indoor plants tend to have a dormant stage during the winter, so it is likely they will not need to be watered as often during this time. Morning tends to be a good time to water your plants. Watering at night can cause your plants to develop diseases more easily because the plant does not have time to dry before the temperature cools.  Stick a finger in the soil up to your first knuckle and notice if the soil is moist enough. If you finger can’t even enter the soil, it definitely needs to be watered. If you reach an inch or so deep but your finger is completely dry, it probably needs water. If the top inch feels fairly moist, and some of the dirt sticks to your finger, it probably has enough water.Again, this is not a guarantee for every plant. But most of the time if the top portion of soil is dried out, the plant could use some more water. You can buy a moisture meter that sticks in the soil and tells you when the plant needs water, which might be helpful and save guesswork.  Leaves can be a good indication of both under and overwatering. If the leaves seem to be hanging limp, this often means the plant needs water. If they are brown, dry, or some have fallen out, this usually means the plant needs water.These signs mean that something is very wrong. Do not wait until your plant develops these signs before you water them. If the plant is dried out, water it slowly. Giving it too much water all at once might kill it. These same signs can sometimes mean the plant has been overwatered, so use this in conjunction with checking the soil. If you know you just watered it that day, give the plant time to absorb and use that water before watering it again.  You can test if your plant has enough water by lifting it after you have just watered it and noticing how heavy it feels. Lift it periodically, and when it doesn’t feel heavy enough, you’ll know it needs some water. It’s more of an art than a science, but this can be good trick to master.This is only a good test for plants that are light enough to pick up and if you have the strength to do so. It’s not worth straining yourself just to check.  You might assume that water from your faucet is just fine, but you may be wrong. City water can have chlorine and fluoride which not all plants can handle. Soft water may have too much salt. Tap water may be too alkaline. If you use a certain water for awhile and it doesn’t seem to be keeping your plants healthy, it’s probably time to switch.If you can store a container outside to catch rainwater, this is a great option since it’s what the plants would get naturally. If you happen to live somewhere that has acid rain, this won’t work. Melted snow is also a good option if you live in colder climates with little rain. Bottled water can also be a good option, although this may be too costly. For city water, you can fill an open container and let the water sit for a day or so, which allows the chemicals to evaporate before you use it on your plants.  After each watering, refill your watering container and let it sit until the next time you water. This way, the water can warm up to a standard temperature rather than whatever temperature it would be from the tap or from rainwater. Most plants tend to prefer tepid water over cold water.If you have multiple plants and need a lot of water, consider keeping a few jugs, or watering cans, stored somewhere that you can keep filled and ready for when you need them.  You want to err on the side of giving you plants less than enough water, because you can easily add a little more. Once you water plants too much, it is a lot of work to fix it. Keep track of how much water you use from one time to the next so you can get an idea how much is the right amount.   Some plants can also benefit from misting the leaves, since watering mainly affects the roots. It is important to know your plant, however. Some leaves actually won’t benefit from misting, and some plants may even be harmed from getting their leaves wet.  If you do overwater your plant, and it isn’t draining, you can do a couple things to help stabilize it. Gently tip the pot on it’s side and allow the excess water to drain out for awhile. Or place paper towels on the surface of the soil and let them absorb some of the water. If it becomes a real problem, consider repotting in a new container that has better drainage. Try moving the pot to a warmer location so that it will dry more quickly. Avoid watering the plant for a while. Wait until the soil has dried out again.  Plants should be matched to a container of the right size to ensure that water is distributed efficiently. Plants in containers that are too small can become “root bound,” meaning the roots take up all the space. Plants in containers that are too big may not hold water in the soil and so will become dried out.If you check the roots and you can tell there is more root than soil, this is a good indication that it’s time to get a bigger pot. You only want to move plants up one pot size at a time so you don’t end up with too much extra room. If the leaves of the plant seem disproportionate in size to the bottom, you should move up a pot size. If the pot has ever tipped over because of being top heavy, this is a definite indication you need a bigger pot. As with many aspects of tending indoor plants, there is no hard and fast rule that always applies. You need to occasionally take stock of your plant and judge if you feel a bigger pot would benefit it.  Since overwatering is often what kills plants, pots that allow plants to drain are very important. These pots will either have a hole in the center of the bottom or may have some kind of thin slits on the bottom. Pots with a solid bottom can cause water to pool and the roots can rot if soaked for too long.If pots without drainage holes are your only option, it works well to put a layer of stones at the bottom of the pot. Extra water can pool there and won’t be in direct contact with the soil and roots. The stone layer should be an inch or so deep. Be extra careful not to overwater your plants. If you can only find plastic pots without holes, you can drill your own holes into the bottom.  If your pot is going to drain water, you most definitely don’t want it draining out onto your floors. You can purchase plastic pans specifically for this, or you can improvise and use a plate or saucer. You could even cut up a milk jug or 2 liter bottle if the pot is small enough and you aren’t overly concerned with the appearance of it.Always empty this drainage pan within a half hour or so after watering, rather than allowing the plant to sit in it. If you don’t drain the pan, it’s basically the same as having a pot with no holes, as the plant will still be soaking in too much water.  If you have had a plant for a while and you can tell it is growing bigger, it may be best to replant it in a bigger pot. If the soil of the plant has shrunk away from the edges, it may need a smaller pot. To check if a plant has become root bound, you can carefully pull it out of the pot and check if there is still plenty of soil or if it seems to be mostly roots.	Research your specific plants’ needs. Let the plant determine when you water it. Perform the finger test. Watch the leaves. Learn the weight of your well-watered plant. Pay attention to the type of water you use. Use room temperature water. Pour water evenly across the surface of the soil. Correct overwatering. Pot plants in properly sized containers. Place plants in a pot with drainage holes. Place a drainage pan under the pot. Repot when necessary.
Oil and grease, often found on garage floors, should be cleaned with an alkaline degreaser. You can purchase this online or at a hardware store. Consult the label to see how much water to use to dilute your degreaser. Apply to oil and grease stains and then rinse it out completely using water.Make sure to wear goggles and gloves when applying degreaser.  In general, chemical strippers should not be used on cement. In the event of graffiti, however, such cleaning solutions are necessary. Go for citrus-based strippers, as these are the mildest. Apply these cleaners to the graffiti and allow them to sit in for several hours before rinsing them out. Use protective gear when working with chemical cleaners.Apply an acid neutralizer, which you can buy at a hardware store, according to package directions after using a chemical stripper.  Rust stains are difficult to remove and sometimes require professional cleaning. Cleaners with oxalic acid are usually used to remove rust stains. Apply these according to package instructions, making sure to wear goggles and gloves.As removing concrete can be difficult, it's usually best to seek professional help if you have concrete built up on your cement.	Use an alkaline degreaser for oil and grease. Look for chemical strippers to remove graffiti. Remove rust stains.
Enthusiasm for gardening is great, but can rapidly dry up when the work mounts. Start with a small flower bed, say 25 square feet, which is room for around 20 to 30 plants with perhaps three types of annuals and one or two perennials. You can always increase you plantings as your experience grows.   If even a 25 square foot plot seems like too much, make a small border or do your first flower gardening in a container. Two or three plants sharing a fancy container can look stunning and give you a sample of what's to come.; , On the other hand, if you're no good at planning on paper, or you know about where and how large you'd like the bed, simply lay it out right there in your garden.   Laying a garden hose on the ground is one way to mark or plan a gentle curve. If you have a lawn adjoining the bed you are digging, remember to leave yourself mower access.  How much sun an area gets is a prime consideration. Six hours of sunlight will do for the greatest variety of plants. Stay away from underground utility lines and allow at least three feet from a building or fence. /images/thumb/3/3e/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-3-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/3/3e/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-3-Version-3.jpg          In hot climates, it is best to have some shade from the relentless afternoon sun, so a flower bed to the east of a building or fence usually works best. This also gives some protection from the hot drying winds that usually come from the west. You can grow a garden even if you get 12 hours of full sunlight, but you should be more careful about which flowers you choose to grow. Pick ones that love full exposure to the sun. Your garden will also need more frequent watering.  All soils can be improved, but avoid areas with shallow, rocky soil, areas where water stands, or steep slopes. Stay at least 20 feet (6.1 m) away from a large tree or five feet away from a sizable bush. Trees will compete with your garden for water and nutrients. /images/thumb/e/e5/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-4-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/e/e5/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-4-Version-3.jpg         , While not strictly required, a soil test will help to determine what nutrients the soil requires and will tell you the fertilizers that soil needs as well as its pH. Your local Department of Agriculture extension service can help. /images/thumb/6/6b/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-5-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/6/6b/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-5-Version-3.jpg         , Once you locate a site and mark out the boundaries with a water hose, remove all sod and pieces of grass or weeds that may re-sprout. Using a spade or garden fork, completely dig up the bed to at least eight inches deep, a foot deep is better. Remove rocks or any debris. /images/thumb/7/7a/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-6-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/7/7a/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-6-Version-3.jpg         , Add one or more inches of compost or manure, more if the soil is poor. If the soil is sandy, add peat moss or grass cuttings to improve the soil's water holding capacity. Add lime if the soil is too acid. Most plants like neutral to slightly acid soil. /images/thumb/d/df/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/d/df/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-7-Version-3.jpg          Soil amendments such as compost can be bought by the bag or sometimes by the truckload. Work the amendments into the top six inches of soil along with a general-purpose fertilizer such as 10-20-10.  Smaller plants go in the front of the bed. Most plants are planted at the same depth they were growing. Firm the soil around them. Remember when placing plants that they will grow, so start with extra space and read the labels carefully to see how much space to leave them. /images/thumb/b/bd/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-8-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/b/bd/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-8-Version-3.jpg          Get a variety of flowers because they bloom at different times and this will keep your flower garden always in bloom. If you do not have many flowers blooming early spring or late summer, drive around your area and see what is blooming. Go out and buy a few of these and plant them. After doing this a couple of times, you will have flowers almost all year round.  Like a good waiter, a good gardener will check whether water is required before watering. How much you water will depend upon the needs of your plants, the climate and exposure, and how much rain your yard gets. /images/thumb/e/e8/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-9-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/e8/Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Start-a-Flower-Garden-Step-9-Version-2.jpg         , Many plants will re-bloom, but only if the old blooms are cut. Also, support and prune your plants as necessary.	Start small. Make a detailed landscaping plan and dig a flower bed to fit that scheme, if you want. Choose a site. Choose a site with good soil, if possible. Get a soil test. Start digging. Level the bed and break up any clods with a rake. Buy the plants or seeds then plant according to their directions. Water thoroughly. Cut spent blooms periodically.
Doing research can save you money in the end, and the following information can help you get started:   Vintage typewriters are generally those made before 1920. These machines can often command a price between $300 and $10,000. There are a number of vintage typewriters that use other methods than the "QWERTY" keyboard. These command much higher prices. Common American typewriter models include: Remington, Royal, Underwood, and Smith Corona. A popular German brand is the Olympia. Other vintage models to look for are the Blickensderfer, Hammond and Oliver. The Underwood number 5 is possibly the most common vintage typewriter on the market today. It was mass-produced for the first half of the 20th century. It is renowned for being convenient, fairly light and striking. It is rare to find a typewriter for less than $100 (64 pounds, 74 euros). Jewelry makers are willing to pay that much to deconstruct a typewriter's keyboard and use the keys for jewelry. A typewriter under $100 is very unlikely to work, and it may need to be refurbished.; , Some good titles for research are American Typewriters: A Collector's Encyclopedia by Paul Lippman or Antique Typewriters: From Creed to QWERTY by Michael Adler.  This will help you determine if a typewriter is in need of a major repair, or a simple replacement. Become familiar with the keys, type bars, carriage, platen, ribbon and carriage return mechanism.  Unless the typewriter is listed on a collector website, it is unlikely the person is qualified to determine the condition of the typewriter. A "like-new" typewriter, listed on eBay, may be broken and require several hundred dollars of refurbishing before it can work.   Typewriters are bulky and heavy. They can be easily damaged during shipment. If you buy an old typewriter online, be sure you can return it if it is packaged poorly and damaged upon arrival.  Pawn shops in both cities and small towns often have typewriters in fairly good condition. Although pawn sellers often have a good grasp on what a typewriter is worth, you may be able to barter to get a lower price.  Antiques dealers are aware of the value of antique typewriters, so it is likely that they would sell you something in very good condition.  People who worked in an office during the last century, often used typewriters at home. It is not uncommon to find an Underwood at an advertised estate sale or garage sale.  Ebay typewriter auction can be a gamble, because there is no guarantee of condition. There is a wide selection, but overbidding is very common.  These sites guarantee their typewriters and offer a wide variety. Prices for typewriters in working order may be more expensive and include a high shipping price, but it may save you on repair costs.  Freecycle.org connects groups that give items away, and Craigslist's classified encourage low prices for people looking to get rid of items quickly. These typewriters are ideal for repurposing because they are likely to be in poor condition.	Understand the value of a vintage typewriter before you begin to shop. Buy a typewriter collecting book, or borrow 1 at the library. Know typewriter terminology. Use extreme caution before buying typewriters off the Internet. Begin shopping at local pawn shops. Shop at antique malls or stores for working typewriters. Visit estate sales or garage sales. Keep track on eBay auctions for vintage typewriters. Buy from a trusted online seller like VintageTypewriterShoppe.com or MrTypewriter.com. Look on the Freecycle network or craigslist for free or low-cost typewriters.
Although helpful for those collectors who collect comic books for the stories or the artwork, reprint comics such as "Famous First Editions" have nowhere near the monetary value of the original issues they are reprints of.   The only reprint exception is Superman #1, which reprinted the Superman story in Action Comics #1. It was the first comic named for a superhero character, however, and subsequent issues featured original stories of the Man of Tomorrow.  As comic book companies became aware of the collector market, they began pandering to it with various gimmicks designed to boost sales. Although these gimmicks made money for the comics companies, these comics were produced in large enough quantities that they provide little value for collectors who collect for profit. Such gimmicks include:   Shipping new comics pre-bagged. Although collectors bag their comics to preserve their value, buying a comic already bagged forces the buyer to choose whether to keep the comic in its bag to preserve its value or open the bag to read it and reduce its value. The hope was that buyers would buy 2 copies, 1 to read and 1 to keep. Variant covers. Some comics were released with 2, 3, or even over 50 different covers, each representing a different scene in the story inside. While some of these are incredibly valuable, without knowing what you are looking for, you could spend money on books with virtually no value. Since the mid-2000s, most variants are either released tied to an event (comic-con, or store release), or limited based on the number of copies of a comic that a store orders (1 variant per 100 copies of the normal cover that the store purchases). Knowing how rare a book is an how many were printed makes all of the difference in the value potential. Gimmick covers. In addition to variant covers, other cover gimmicks used include holograms, foil stamping, or glow-in-the-dark covers. Some gimmicks may have been tied to milestone issues, such as the silver foil cover for Issue 25 of Valiant's "Magnus, Robot Fighter," but in most cases, the stories were not notably better than those in issues without the gimmicks.	Avoid special reprint comics. Avoid gimmicks.
Repeat until you know the eight-beat rhythm well. Here's what you need to know:There are eight shag dance steps, each of which corresponds to a beat. The "one-and-two" and "three-and-four" steps should take about as much time to complete as the "five-six." Get some good shag dance music going, while you're at it. Here are some favorites:  "The Flame" by Fine Young Cannibals "Do You Believe" by Cher "Never Make a Move Too Soon" by B.B. King "Your Heart's in Good Hands" by Al Green "Mojo Boogie" by Henry Gray  ; , Know that the idea of counting is to give your feet a beat to move to. Your feet will move with every count, which includes any number you say as well as the word "and."   Before you try incorporating the shag dance moves, just step in place. Alternate between your left and right foot. Repeat until you're comfortable counting the rhythm and alternating feet. In the shag dance, you'll never step with the same foot twice in a row. This is a fluid, not a jerky dance move. Think of your forward and backward movement as the movement of a swinging pendulum. Avoid having any bounce in your steps and smoothly transition from one step to the other.  This is an important thing to know before you begin to shag dance. Think of it as the partners creating a mirror image of each other's steps. If you're at a loss for what to do and have a knowledgeable partner who is facing you, just mirror his or her footsteps.   Women should always do the same step as the men but with the opposite foot. Women, therefore, should lead with the right foot. As you start to move your feet, remember that your lower body should do most of the work for this particular dance. Keep your upper body upright and tall and avoid swaying. Both men and women should wear leather-bottomed shoes, with the women wearing flats, to prevent them from shuffling across the floor.  The man and woman should stand facing each other. Men and women should keep their feet lose and relaxed, standing so that they are facing each other, with their feet opposite each other with about an arm's length of space in between them.The man should hold the woman's right hand with his left hand. He should hold her hand fairly firmly, without gripping her too tightly, to lead the woman. The forearm of the hands that are holding each other should be level with the floor, and should not sway from side to side or move up or down, either. The pair should keep the non-holding arm in a relaxed, but slightly forward hanging position.  The step should be no longer than the length of his foot. As he does this, the woman should step forward with her right foot.   This step occurs on the "one" beat.  As he does this, the woman should step forward with her left foot. Think of it as stepping up to a line, having your feet meet in the same place, so that they are evenly positioned on the ground.   This step occurs on the "and" beat. From your original starting position, it is as if you simply stepped up one "space."  , This foot should now be in its original starting position. As the man steps back his left foot, the woman should step back her right foot to its starting position.   This step occurs on the "two" beat.  Think of it as moving the right foot the length of two feet, so that it is positioned one "foot" behind the left foot. The woman should step her left foot back one foot length behind her right foot.   The step occurs on the "three" beat.  He can also take a small step in place, but he should make sure not to move his foot forwards or backwards. The woman should shift her weight onto her right foot, making sure not to move forward or backwards, either.   This steps occurs on the second "and" beat.  The man should do the same thing he did with his left foot, taking care not to move forward or backwards as he shifts the weight. As he does this, the woman should shift her weight on her left foot.   This steps occurs on the "four" beat.  His left foot and right should now be parallel, as if he had stepped up to meet a line, stepping one full "space" back from his original starting position. As he does this, the woman should step her right foot back to meet her left foot.   This step occurs on the "five" beat.  The foot will now be one foot's length in front of the left foot. As he does this, the woman should step forward with her left foot.   This steps occurs on the "six" beat.  As he does this, the woman should step her right foot forward, repeating her first step.   This occurs during the new "one" beat.  Keep counting and moving your feet in the same way to the beat. As you get more experienced, you can get a bit more creative with your body movements by moving in a circle as you face your partner, having the man spin the female partner, taking more exaggerated steps, or by putting some more arm movements into the mix.The female partner can also spin on her own to add some flair to the dance. Though the traditional hand position is for the pair to hold opposite hands with the other hands free, the man can place his hand on the small of the woman's back during the dance, or just during part of the dance, too. One partner can even dance behind the other, still holding hands while facing that partner's back.	Learn to count "one-and-two, three-and-four, five-six.", Learn to step in time to the eight-beat rhythm. Know that men and women should do the same step with the opposite foot. Understand the starting position. The man should step forward with his left foot. The man should step forward with his right foot. The man should step his left foot back one step. The man should step his right foot back one foot length behind his left foot. The man should shift his weight onto his left foot. The man should shift his weight onto his right foot. The man should step back his left foot to meet the right. The man should step forward with his right foot. The man should step his left foot forward, repeating the first step. Repeat all the steps.
Make sure that the water supply is turned off completely at the main supply point. If the furnace should fail on a very cold day, water in a pipe could freeze and burst the pipe.; , If you live in an area where freezing pipes can be a problem, drain the toilets, the water heater (turn off the gas or electric supply first) and the expansion tank.   Get an air compressor to blow the lines of excess water. Eliminate or dilute the water in drain traps by pouring an "RV" type antifreeze solution into them, as directed by the instructions. Close the sink and tub drains. If a house is to be vacant for a long time, you may prevent water in a toilet’s trap from evaporating (and thereby permitting sewer gases to enter the home) by raising the toilet’s lid and seat and covering the bowl with saran wrap. If you have an indoor or outdoor pool, drain the water. Turn off and drain fountains and other sources of standing water. Drain water from dishwashers and pour RV antifreeze. with refrigerators (with a water dispenser or an ice maker) and washing machines, following the manufacturer’s directions. Remove the water filter from inside the refrigerator. Remove and empty any "whole house" or "in line" type filter canister.  Set your thermostat to a level adequate to keep the inside temperature above freezing and to keep things dry. If the home is located in a warm, damp climate, you should have a humidity indicator installed and set to maintain a reasonably dry interior.  If you leave the electric power on, unplug electric appliances, including microwave ovens and TVs, to avoid the risk of fire in the event of a faulty switch or a rodent gnawing the wires.  For long absences, some experts recommend shutting off gas hot water heaters completely.	Turn off the water at the exterior. Open all faucets and drain all waterlines. Turn down the thermostat. Unplug all appliances. Don't forget the gas.

Ask yourself these questions:   What type of transmission do you have? Some starters only work on automatic transmissions. Do you have a fuel-injected engine? If not, you will have to purchase a remote starter system specially made for your type of truck.; , Your budget will be the main determinant of what options and upgrades are available to you. Remember that, in addition to the basics mentioned above, your remote starter installation may also include these features, among others:   Keyless entry. Security system with alarm. A different frequency each time you use the remote starter. The ability to transmit at a greater distance than the standard 1000 feet (0.9 km), sometimes up to 1 mile (1.6 km) and even through concrete walls. An LCD screen status display. A temperature sensor that will automatically trigger your remote starter system to start if/when the temperature reaches below a certain point. Automatic door unlocking and auto alarm disengagement when you enter within a certain vicinity of you truck. The ability to adjust your engine cranking time. An anti-hijacking feature. PIN touchpad.  Make a list of the manufacturers and their contact information. ,, Read reviews in order to choose the best one for you.	Determine what kind of remote starter you need for your particular type of truck. Make a list of the features you want. Search the Internet for reputable remote starter system manufacturers. Contact manufacturers and ask them to send you all of their remote starter product brochures.  , Read over the brochures and decide which systems have all of the features you need and want.  , Research the remote starter systems that apply to your specific needs online. Find retailers that sell the remote starter you are interested in and shop around for the best price.
If you do not know how to do this, then you can just do it by ear, but it is easier if you know which fret is an A, and which one is a F-Sharp. To start of, know that the standard tuning is from high to low: E, A, D, G.; , If you come across A-Flat twice, list it in the scale. Only write notes in this scale unless you know what you are doing., Should it be fast? Slow? Technical? Ask yourself as many question as you need to determine what you want. Write notes out that you determined in the scale. Try to follow an up, or down pattern for a few notes and then change it up. For example: A, B, C, B, D, A, C, A.,   Do this with a pencil (not a pen) and a piece of paper.  Work with every note like this for ten minutes.  Now pick out which 10 of the notes stand out to you the most and play around with those in any order. Do this for ten minutes.  Now pick the top 8 notes that stood out to you from those 10 notes. Take those notes and play around with them for at least 15 minutes.  Hopefully now your mind and fingers will be used to the randomness. Take the notes and try to put them together like a puzzle. Spend 10 minutes on this.  The "pictures" are on it. Now it's time to give those pictures some color. Understand hammer-ons, pull-offs, tremolo, tremolo picking, vibrato, and sliding.  Once you are done... Great! Now there is "paint" on the puzzle. But it needs to be more interesting. How about shades, tints, and blends!  , You have the choice of either getting a whammy bar or a whammy bar pedal. Either will change the pitch of the notes. The pitch can rise into the sky or fall down to the depths of the ocean., A "dive bomb" effect occurs when you push the whammy bar down to where it touches the guitar. The opposite effect occurs when you pull the whammy bar up to where the handle is at a 75* angle. (It's already at a 50* angle.) Practice these effects. One simple effect you can use at the end of a song is to move the neck of the guitar/bass up and down. That makes a "wavy" sound. You don't need a whammy bar for this.  Now the puzzle is complete and very interesting. Maybe the "drawing" is a little misshapen; maybe the "paint" got a little out of the lines. So fix it.  Form a short, four-to-five-note melody and repeat it over and over, experimenting by adding or subtracting notes. For example, if you start with the melody E B D E G E, you could expand it to E B D E G E D E D C A.	Learn the notes of the strings and frets. Learn the scale it is in by listing all of the notes that you play, getting rid of duplicates. Determine the style of the solo. Learn how to read and write tablature so you can write your solo down. Pick a note (an A, for instance) and play it on every string. Experiment with different arrangements. Experiment more and find what you like. Embrace the random. Complete the picture. Find out where the special tricks from the step above should go in the solo. Add effects if you desire. Pressing down on the whammy bar lowers the pitch; pulling it up raises the pitch. Iterate and then, reiterate. Pick a few notes in the same scale. Now play the best solo anyone has ever heard.
Find out how many gallons of fuel your vehicle's fuel tank holds. For each 1 gallon (4 L) of fuel, you will need to add 1 oz (30 ml) of Seafoam.Adding Seafoam directly to the fuel tank will provide a variety of benefits. It can clean deposits left behind in the fuel injectors, thereby making your vehicle run more smoothly. It can also control moisture buildup in the fuel, stabilize the fuel, and lubricate the upper cylinders.  Go to the gas station and fill the vehicle's gas tank with octane gasoline.   When filling the tank, make sure that you leave enough room in the tank to add the calculated amount of Seafoam afterward. While Seafoam can technically be used with any octane gas, it is recommended that you use it with 91 octane or higher. Fuel with a higher octane number requires a greater amount of heat and compression to ignite, leading to improved performance. The Seafoam can provide a greater benefit to the vehicle under these conditions, as well.  Place a long-neck funnel in the fuel tank and pour your calculated amount of Seafoam directly into the fuel tank.Pour the product slowly to avoid spills. Using a funnel will also help prevent spills. Due to the design of the bottle and the position of the fuel tank opening, it is nearly impossible to pour Seafoam directly from the bottle and into the fuel tank without the use of a funnel.  Put the fuel tank cap back on and drive your car at a steady pace for at least five to ten minutes.   As you drive, the Seafoam should mix into the gasoline, improving the quality of the gasoline and cleaning the fuel injectors at the same time. Try to run this tank of gasoline until the vehicle is nearly empty to maximize the effectiveness of the Seafoam. After completing this step, the process is complete.	Figure out how much Seafoam you'll need. Fill the gas tank. Pour the Seafoam into the fuel tank. Drive the vehicle.
The only requirement is that it be a hardcover book; you can use any kind you want, even old textbooks that you no longer need!   The length of the book is also up to you, but remember that the shorter the book (page-wise), the smaller your jewelry box will be.  Open the book and, on the first page, draw a rectangle using your ruler. Your lines should be one inch from the edge all the way around.  Use an X-Acto knife to cut along the lines of the rectangle you just drew. It may be helpful to use cut along the line of your ruler to keep your cuts as straight as possible.   Cut all the way around and discard the page rectangles from the center. Do this as many times as necessary. Remember, the thicker your book is, the more cuts you'll need to make as the X-Acto knife will only go through a handful of pages at a time. As you cut, it may be helpful to use a binder clip to hold the pages together that you have already cut. This will keep the pages you are done with out of your way as you continue cutting.  As you cut, little slivers of paper will get lodged in the pages. Hold the book upside down by both covers and shake out any loose pieces.  Use Mod Podge (crafting adhesive/sealant) to glue all of the pages. First, dip a paint brush in the Mod Podge and paint in between several pages to make them stick together. Then, paint the outside of all of the pages as well as the edges of the pages that are exposed inside the rectangle that you cut. You should glue the pages to the bottom cover, but leave the top cover of the book unglued.   Alternatively, you can use watered-down regular glue (Elmers, etc.) instead of the Mod Podge. It should take the adhesive approximately ten minutes to fully dry. Once the book is completely dry, the front cover of the book should lift up to reveal the cut-out rectangle pages where you can store your jewelry.  If you want to, you can decorate the outside of the book to make it more attractive. You can glue on rhinestones or fabric designs (flowers, etc.) to suit your taste.	Choose an old book. Draw a rectangle inside the book. Cut the pages. Shake all the excess paper out. Glue the pages together. Decorate the outside.
Look for a girl that is doing a simple side to side motion with her hips. Some girls do a figure 8 motion, but it is suggested to be tried side to side first.; , If your request is accepted, gently place your hands at her hips and sway to the beat.  She may lean forward, put her hands on her knees, and start to move her butt up and down against your pelvic area. Just stand there while she does it, you can either keep your hands on her hips or place them on her back. She may do some moves that are specific to the song like "pop, lock, and drop it". Don't try to follow her on these moves.  If she smiles or leans back into you, or she's telling her friend what a great time she's having, you can take it a little further. Try moving your hand to her inner thigh and leaning your head into her neck, but don't go too fast. Some girls like to keep things slow.  this is where you put your left leg (or right leg if your left footed) in between her legs. Sway your hips from side to side and start with your hands on her hips after a while you can try to lower your hands down onto her butt. Slowly get closer throughout the song.  Put a hand on her shoulder and turn her around so shes facing you. Then move your hands to her back. Now go in for the kiss! If she smiles or comes back in for another this means she liked it and wants more. So begin to kiss her more and longer until you are making out.  Squeeze in between them and grind normally with the one in front of you. The girl behind you will put her hands on your hips and grind with you from behind. This is called a sandwich.  After a song ends grab her hand, walk to the refreshments area, and buy her a drink. This gives both of you a chance to cool down. Try to start a conversation and get her number. After a few minutes head back to the dance floor.	If you have never performed the act of grinding before don't worry. Politely ask the girl you want to grind with if you can, in fact, grind with her. After you have been grinding for a little the girl may start to do some other moves. Watch the signs she sends you. If you want to change things up you can try a front to front grind. If there is a slow part to a song this is a good chance to go in for a kiss. If you see two girls grinding with each other this is a great opportunity. If you really like a certain girl and would like to continue with her through the night give her a break.
The thickest string on the guitar is the 6th string. Since it is an E, the root note of an E7, you can leave this string open.          Remember that guitar strings count from the bottom up. The thinnest string is the 1st string, the thickest the 6th.  Shortcut: If you already know an open E-major chord you simply have to remove one finger to get an E7. Remove your finger from the 4th string, leaving it open. This is an E7.; , The fifth string, the A, is fretted at the 2nd fret. If you remember E-major, the form so far is the same for your E7.  This is actually the 7th note, but a higher octave of it than found in the major scale. If you don't care about the music theory, just leave this string open and move on.          Make sure that your ring finger doesn't mute this string accidentally.  This is actually the last note you need to worry about -- the rest of the strings are left open. Again, this is the same note used in an E-major.  All you need to do is play an E7 are these two notes and the other open strings. That's it. Strum all the strings to sound out your bluesy chord. The final chord looks like this in tab:          --0-- --0-- --1-- --0-- --2-- --0--	Leave the top string, the low-E, open. Place your ring finger on the 2nd fret of the A string. Leave the 4th string, the D, open. Fret the G string on the 1st fret with your index or middle finger. Strum all of the strings at once to play your E7.
This is extremely important because if you prune at the wrong time of the year, your Hydrangea bush may not flower again:   If your blooms are pink, blue or purple, you have a mophead or lacecap Hydrangea. These flowers bloom on old wood (stems that have been on the plant since the previous summer). Prune this type only in the summer, but before August—before they set their flower buds for next year. If you Hydrangea flowers are white, they are blooming on new wood (stems that have developed during the current growing season). This type of Hydrangea produces flower buds on the stems in August, September and October—which will result in flowers the following summer. If you prune this type of new wood Hydrangea in the fall, winter or spring, the bloom buds will be removed and you won’t have a flowering shrub the following year.; , This practice is called “deadheading.” Use sharp pruning shears to clip off the spent flower. If you deadhead before August on old wood Hydrangeas, it doesn’t matter where you cut on the stem because it won’t jeopardize next year’s blooms. ,, Never prune them in the spring and summer or you will destroy the flower buds.	Determine if your Hydrangea blooms on old wood or new wood. Remove all old blooms at any time no matter what type of Hydrangea you have. Remember the old wood rule when cutting new blooms for your flower arrangements: you can cut your flowers with long stems before August, but after August, cut new blooms just above the first set of large leaves so that you don’t disturb new developing bloom buds.  , Prune all dead stems every year no matter what type of Hydrangea you have.  , Prune all new wood Hydrangeas in the fall and winter.
For example, if you're going from D to G, that's a perfect fourth, or four notes up, counting the D, the G, and all the notes in between. If you don't know about harmonic intervals, count the semitones, eg: A to Bb is one semitone, A to B is two semitones, D to G is five semitones.; , For example, D has F# and C#. G just has F#. Ab has Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db. Also, make sure you know how to write the new key, and which order to add in the sharps and flats. (See Work Out Which Key You're In).  Continuing with the same example, when you see a D, play a G. If you see an E, play an A, and so on.  For example, if you see a C in the original music (which is actually a C#, but that isn't important right now), you're going to play an F, because that's a fourth higher than C. But you're in G now, which has an F# in the key signature. So you play an F# instead. In this example, both the original note and the new note are both sharped. This will not always be the case. A natural note may become sharp or flat or natural, depending on the new key. This won't matter if you have translated everything up or down the same number of semitones.  For example, if your original song (in D) has a Bb, that's a half-step down from its normal pitch (n to b = -1). The note B in the old key corresponds to the note E in the new key. In the new key (G) E is normally natural, so you must drop it a half-step, to Eb.  You're transposing it to E, which has F#, C#, G#, and D#. You see a D# in the written score. You say to yourself, " D is normally flatted in this key, but here it's sharpened. That means it's been raised two semitones, or one tone. D in the old key corresponds to A in the new key. A minor doesn't have any sharps or flats associated with it, so to raise it a whole-step up from A natural, play Ax, which is equivalent to B." Don't worry; it's not usually going to be this difficult in real life.  For example, if the original music goes from C to D (a modulation of one tone), and you're transposing such that it starts in Eb, the music after the key change must be in a key a tone higher than Eb, which is of course F.	Figure out how far you're going. Know what the key signature of the new key is. Play the music as written, except play everything the number of semitones higher or lower. Include the sharps or flats in the NEW key signature. Choose the corresponding accidental for the new key. Playing a song written in Ab, which has Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db. If there's a key change in the song itself, you have to make sure to transpose the music after the key change correctly.
Once the hard work of preparing the dresser is over, the fun part begins. Which refinish will you use? Each finish has its own special look, with some more complicated to apply than others. Some suggestions include:   New paintwork (acrylic, enamel, dual colors, a pattern, a design, etc.) Spray painting Distressed painting A paint wash Wood stains with wax Wax alone  Varnish or varnish stains Oils French polish Lacquered finishes (hard for non-professionals but black japanned finishes are one possibility) Decoupage Fabric.	Decide on how you will refinish the dresser. The following sections cover paintwork, waxing and using oils as refinish surfaces.
Although Twitter is not the most popular social networking account that there is, you will find you can "make fans" with twitter. Twitter is often used to share "less-personal" (more openly public) information, unlike sites such as Facebook. Facebook people tend to have "more-personal" settings and only add people they know. With Twitter a lot of people use it to easily add people whom they do not know. With Twitter make sure you keep up with "trends". Be trendy. This is very important. It will help people notice you, so that more and more people will start to follow you.; , As well as doing your own songs (if you have your own songs) especially start off by doing covers. Why? Searching other names/brands -- but finding your covers there -- can bring a potential army of fans. Examples of those who used covers -- Here are two known stars who both started out by doing covers of songs on YouTube: Covers plus their own music online helped start-up of Justin Bieber and Conor Maynard toward both being very popular artists. Justin in particular is the 2nd most popular person on twitter.   Do songs which are new and current as well as old time classics.  Although a bunch of covers can draw fans, it is very important that your growing fan base knows what your identity is (explained how below).  Focus your efforts on your current fans to gain many new fans. Get your present fans to interact with your "social pages"/to your brand name. The more often they post to your page, the better chances that you set-up for their friends to catch it, see it, in your fan's newsfeeds and hopefully catch-on to become a new fan.   Free pub: Every time any fan or friend interacts with one of your pages, that’s a free newsfeed (free advertising) for your brand. Free ads! You don’t have to splash dollars into Facebook PPC to grow your own online community. , Fans like this and will often watch video road-diaries of you. ,: Beliebers or TWFanmily/Prisoners. , The more someone feels appreciated, the more likely they are to communicate with your page, post positive comments and recommend your page to their friends, too. Say "Thank you so much; you're great." Say (out of nowhere), "Thanks!" to a fan; So, when s/he asks "For what?" Say, "For being my friend!", and shake hands and/or hug, if they allow you. Announce to your fans what you’ve put on Facebook and Twitter. Show your customers what they’re missing and encourage them to join.  ASK, “Are you a fan/follower? If not, here’s what you’re missing!” Show the benefits of being a fan, event schedules, win prizes on Facebook, fan-only coupons? This will also show non-fans the perks of becoming a fan.   Instead of just posting a link to a song, ask your fans what they think about it. Use Facebook Questions (poll) to ask your fans anything from what kind of breakfast starts their day off right to what they like most about your songs/music. The more engaged your fans become, the more impressions your posts will get.  Add a call-out in any messages (and recorded voicemail greeting, messages) that says “Remember, you can also reach (us) on Facebook at Facebook.com/and Twitter @.” This soothes any frustration a fan might have, if they can’t get hold of someone to answer a question or request they might have. Alert your customers of any coupons or contests you’re running on Facebook through an e-blast with direct links to your pages.   Check your Facebook Insights to see what types of posts have been most engaging with your current fans. Sort your Page Post analytics by number of Engaged Users and look at the 10 most engaging posts and the 10 least engaging posts. If the majority of most engaging posts were photos, post more photos. If they were questions, ask more questions. Analyze your least engaging posts to find out what type of content your fans are least interested in.  How? While you keep a style so that you can build a solid fan base -- do some odd songs which are unusual enough to get noticed, and catch on, and spread around, "going viral" if they're fun enough.  Get your fans -- two or three months before it is due to come out -- to pre-order it.	Get followers on Twitter (get a Twitter account). Make special YouTube videos. Make sure as a developing artist you don't only stick to covering one artist (too limiting). Grow a big online community. Make newsy postings: Once you have a lot of fans, start a Facebook page where your fans can also go for bits of news on your identity.  , If you do tours in bars, road houses, pubs and clubs, etc. then create little candid video clips of you along your way when you are touring. Add links to your videos and make sure you tell your fans when you have added a video, on "all" your social networking sites.  , When you have such fans (if they have not already made one), help them to make a name for themselves, e.g. Create catch phrases for your fan base example: "It's a TW Thing"  , Appreciate your current fans with deals and specials on CDs, bumper stickers and shirts. Ask questions. Plaster your social media icons on your website and include icons and links to your email and e-newsletters. Go viral (be catchy). If you do decide to release a single make sure you make a "lyric video" as well for it.
This ensures waste water won't freeze in the tanks. Follow up with a sewer hose rinse to prevent existing solid and liquid waste from solidifying in the hose.  An open gray water valve enables overnight waste to flow into the septic system instead of filling up your tanks. Closing the black water valve prevents excessive odors.  This is to allow for a slow, steady drip of water and ensures water won't freeze because it's moving through the supply lines at all times. Avoid wasting water--wait until bedtime to leave faucets open.	Empty your gray and black water holding tanks. Leave the valve open for your RV grey water tank, but close the black water valve. Open your kitchen and bathroom faucets. Ensure all sink drains are open to avoid a flood.
Having a detailed plan for your project will help you avoid a lot of problems later on.          Decide on the area to be concreted, draw up a plan, and write in all measurements. Determine the finished levels of the work and write these levels on the plan. Determine the thickness (depth) of the concrete and write it on the plan. 4 in. (10 cm) depth is standard for driveways and garages used by passenger vehicles, but not for heavy trucks.  Remember to allow for drainage and ensure that water will not run to undesired locations. Provision a minimum drop of 1" for each ten feet of slab (1.2cm per m), although 1.5" drop for every ten feet of run (1.8cm per m) is preferred.; , Generally, you will need Portland Type I (general use cement) or Type II (used for structures in water or soil containing moderate amounts of sulfate, or when heat build-up is a concern) cement, masonry/builder's sand or other clean sand, and gravel or crushed limestone.          Calculate the volume of concrete required by multiplying the thickness in feet by the square footage of the area to be concreted. Purchase as much concrete as needed for your project. 1 square foot (.093 sq. m) of 4 in. (10 cm) deep concrete requires 50 pounds (22.7 kg) of concrete mix.  Portland cement generally comes in bags weighing 96 lbs (43.5 kg) and should be handled with care. Depending on the size of your project, a truck may be needed to assist in hauling.  Build a mixing box from wood planks or use a sturdy wheelbarrow to mix the materials. If your project is large, rent a mechanical mixer to do reduce the human labor.  In order to contain the wet concrete, assemble the forms along the outer edges of the area you will be placing the concrete in.          Use timber boards to assemble the forms. Brace the boards securely, ensuring that they are strong enough to support the weight of the concrete. Check that the form work is level. If you are plumbing underneath the concrete, ensure it is in the proper place. Confirm that the dimensions of the forms match the dimensions laid out in your plans.  Prepare your dry mix by mixing the cement mix and sand. There are a few common mixtures and methods for concrete preparation.           Option 1: A basic mixture for mortar (not concrete) is made using a 1:2:3 ratio of water to cement to sand by volume.  Option 2: General purpose concrete is created using a 1:2:3 ratio of cement to sand to gravel by volume.  Incorporate the gravel or crushed stone in the dry mixture.          Add gravel or crushed stone at a ratio of up to 5 parts gravel per 1 part cement and sand mixture. The gravel doesn't adversely affect the tensile strength of the concrete unless you add too much. If the gravel doesn't leave enough cement paste to fill the cracks between the gravel, you have added to much. Adding too much gravel can also make it difficult to get a smooth finished surface on the cured concrete.  Begin by adding water to the mixture slowly, mixing continuously until the concrete becomes plastic enough to place in your form.          The plastic character of the concrete is measured in "slump", which is determined by filling a metal "slump" cone with the mixed, wet concrete, lifting the cone off gently, then measuring how far the concrete sags, or slumps. The typical "slump" of good structural concrete is about 3 or 4 inches (7.5 or 10 cm).  Continue mixing until the concrete has a uniform consistency.          The texture should be even throughout the mix, with no pockets of dry material. Continue mixing for two or three more minutes to begin the hydration process, which is ultimately what causes the concrete to harden.  Add the concrete to your form, tapping all the edges to remove air pockets, and let it settle in evenly and firmly.          Using a magnesium float or a smooth flat board, level the concrete across the top. Do this by dragging the tool, tilted slightly upward on the leading edge, across the surface of the concrete. This process is known as "floating" and will float the fine cement paste to the surface. The fine paste is malleable and easy to smooth and finish either by brushing, brooming, or troweling when it begins to "set" or harden.  After floating, leave the concrete alone until it becomes firm enough to finish without leaving tool marks.          Lay out "knee boards" or pieces of plywood that you can walk on without sinking into the concrete. Crawl onto the slab with the appropriate hand tools and finish the concrete into a smooth surface. For very large slabs, you will need a "bull float" and possibly a power troweling machine. This is an investment that is better left to professionals.  After the concrete is placed and finished, cover it and protect it from extreme temperatures and rain for a few days.  Gather and clean all the tools and the mixing container as soon as you are finished with them. Cured, hard concrete is difficult to remove.          Take special care to clean rented equipment, as the rental company often will charge an additional cleaning fee when you return them.	Plan your project carefully. Purchase or gather the raw materials. Assemble or buy a mixing container. Build the forms. Mix the cement and sand. Add the gravel or crushed stone. Add water. Thoroughly mix the concrete. Pour and float the concrete. Let it dry and finish it. Clean up the work space.
Make a c-shape with the middle and ring fingers of your right hand.  Gently rest your thumb on the inner part of the bow frog, allow your other fingers to fall on the bow’s other edge. Loosen up your fingers but keep them together. Your fingers should wrap around the bow in a smooth, yet secure hold.  Your pinky should rest on the head of the stick.  Curve your hand around the bow, so you can move it swiftly.	Hold the bow with your right hand. Lay your fingers on the bow. Curve your pinky. Twist your hand left.
A common mistake for directors is omitting information. Though some information may seem not so important, it will confuse the audience and take them out of the movie.   For example, a scene involving a burglar and a locked cabinet of valuables might be shown like this: The burglar discovers that the cabinet is locked, and opens it with a key. Where did the key come from? How did the burglar get the key? If it is not shown, the audience will not know it. Instead, try this: The burglar discovers that the cabinet is locked, we see the burglar open the top draw and remove a key from it, thus opening the cabinet. Now, with the missing piece of information included, the audience will be satisfied.; , Though identifying all the information is important, if you un-emphatically present the information, the audience might miss it. When adding emphasis to information, remember the following:   The bigger the image size, the more emphatic the information contains. By organizing the composition of the image, you can call attention to the information you wish to emphasize The perspective from which the audience sees the information, or camera angle, is a powerful tool for emphasizing information. Objective inserts is shot from no particular point of view, thus neutral; subjective inserts are usually from a certain point of view, thus more emphatic. You can control emphasis simply by how long you display a piece of information on the screen. The audience has more time to notice and absorb the information when it is on screen longer.  Communicating information is only half the job of a director; A good director presents information in a way that involves the audience emotionally. Here are ways to do this effectively:   The bigger the image size, the more emotional impact it carries. Control the length of a sequence by shooting it in greater or smaller number of shots. By stretching the length of a sequence, the director increases the feeling of urgency. A sequence with ten shots is more suspenseful than a sequence with three shots. Camera Angles can contribute to the overall emotional effect of a scene. High angles often convey a feeling of detachment, while low angles emphasize the power of the image, and the powerlessness of the viewer. Head-on, frontal angles feel formal and calm, while diagonal setups convey movement and energy. The feel of an image is strongly affected by the lens used to record it. Wide angle lenses exaggerate depth and motion toward or away from the camera; the effect they convey is dynamic and energetic. Telephoto lenses, by contrast, suppress depth and motion, keeping the viewer at a distance and conveying a sense of formality. Camera movement can add significantly to the emotional cast of a scene. A stationary camera, panning and tilting from one position, conveys a sense of detached observation. A moving camera, especially when dollying in and out, becomes a part of the action. Moreover, a constantly moving camera imparts a feeling of restless energy. Individual shots can be made shorter or longer, depending on the effect desired. Short shots with quick cuts convey a sense of dynamic energy, while lengthy shots feel calm and deliberate. That is why fights are typically constructed from many brief shots, while romantic scenes are often assembled from fewer but lengthier angles.	Identify the information that the audience needs to know and ensure that all of it is included. Emphasize the information appropriately. Communicate both information and feelings to your audience.
Either use one that you already have or build one from scratch. If you are using an existing one, it must be wide enough to accommodate the top of the stage that you'll be building in the next part. If building one from scratch, cut three base panels to the height of choice, using the following widths:  Cut one piece 59" long for the front panel. Cut two pieces 34" long for the two side pieces.   The height should be determined by what will be high enough to cover an adult squatting down behind the panel. Only your hands should be observed (covered in the puppets), none of your body or head.  Screw these into place firmly. You may also need to glue the edges together for a firm fit, that depends on how well the brackets are holding the pieces together.      The image demonstrates another option for attaching the panels together, using metal square pole joints instead of bracketing the wooden pieces closely together. Cut the flagstaffs (long poles, see image above) to size. Don't make any shelves, as they'll only get in the puppeteers' way. If you need a place to hold items, boxes can be shifted in and out from the back of the stage, as needed.  After you've built the lemonade stand, you have made the base of the puppet stage. You'll now need to make the top of the stage, from which the curtains will hang., They are now ready to be cut as follows:  Cut two pieces 59" long. These will become the long sides of the curtain-top frame. Cut another pair of pieces 34" long.These pieces will become the short sides of the frame. Cut two 23" lengths which will become the filler pieces.      ; ,      Place the 34" side pieces first. One goes on the left and the other on the right. Set the 59" front and back pieces perpendicular to the 34-inch side pieces, with their ends resting on top of the 34" pieces. This forms a rectangle. Set the 23" filler pieces on top of the 34" side pieces and between the 59" front and back pieces. You should now have a rectangle in one plane on the top. Square up the pieces using a framing square to align the outer edges.       Carefully lift up the filler pieces and put carpenter's glue along the bottom surfaces. Replace them and check the alignment with a framing square again. Drive four #8 or #10 x 1-1/4" long screws through each filler piece into the end pieces below, securing the two pieces. , Holding the long side in place, drive three 1/4-inch screws through each end, into the side piece below Avoid driving a screw in the extreme outside corner of each corner; you'll be drilling holes for the curtain rods there later.,, (Perfection is not required.), At each corner, square a line 3-% inches in from each outside edge, so that you have two lines that intersect. Use an awl to punch each intersection point. , Repeat at the other three corners., Square lines across the nearer long side 28 inches (71.1 cm) in from either end. On one of these lines, mark a point 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from the near edge of the frame.,, Mark the point where the two lines intersect. Do the same on the other far corner. If there is a screw in the way at these crosshairs, rake it out now., Drill a hole all the way through the top frame at each of the four points you've marked.  These smaller holes are for the curtain-rod ends.  Each one should measure 11 f 'ct by 12 inches., You should now have three 11-feet by 6-inch lengths of cloth., surface. Clamp the frame in place. Then find the center of the front edge of the frame and make a small pencil mark there., At the midpoint, staple the unfolded edge of the cloth to the center of the front edge of the frame, keeping the edge of the cloth flush with the top edge of the frame. At this stage, the unfolded edge of cloth should be stapled to the wood and the folded edge should hang down.   Grab hold of the top edge of the cloth a few inches to the left of the midpoint. Bring that top edge back against the midpoint staple, making a loop of cloth that points out toward you. Keeping the top edge in position, flatten the loop to the left and staple its end to the edge of the frame. The new staple should be just about an inch away from the midpoint staple. You've just made one pleat.    Grab the cloth a few inches to the left of the pleat, pull the top edge back to the staple you just placed. Fold the loop of cloth down to the left, and staple it flush to the top edge of the top frame. Working to the left, create a series of flat, folded pleats across the top of the top frame. The end result will appear just like the tops of old-fashioned curtains.   Try to keep each of the folds even, stapling every inch or so. You may also find that pleating may be an easier task with two people working together, one to fold and hold the cloth and the other to staple.  Get another length of fabric, and keep going. Overlap the new fabric over the "ruffle" of the old fabric by an inch or so. , At this point, cut the fabric about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) longer than you need, and fold this extra underneath before putting in the last staple, just before the corner.,, Start at the end of one short side, moving across the front, and finishing on the other short side. Cut off any excess ribbon when you are finished.  Gluing, smoothing, and holding the ribbon in place may require a few extra sets of hands.   The result will be a beautiful finished ruffle.  Each piece should be 5 1⁄2 feet (1.7 m) long (but longer is okay too).,, Iron it down. Then, staple it in place., Then bring the other piece of fabric to the work surface, ironing and stapling using the same three folds., Figure out how much you'll have to fold over to make the final width of each cloth 36 inches (91.4 cm). If your fold is more than 2 inches (5.1 cm), use two or even three rows of staples to hold it down.  Alternatively, you can trim off some of the extra cloth to make your fold less than 2 inches (5.1 cm).  Start at a corner and place a clip every 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so., Bend them until they are basically straight.       To bend (or straighten) the tubing, grasp it with both hands, with your thumbs pointing toward each other and about an inch apart. Gently push in with your thumbs until you feel the tubing move. Shift your hands along the tubing and press down again with your thumbs, bending the tubing just a little in each place along its length to avoid creating kinks.  Mark both tubes together at three even intervals where the tubing is going to be bent into shape: a bend in from each end of the tubes and one bend in the middle. The two end bends at each side should be exactly the same measurement in from the ends, about 11 inches in from each end, while the center bend is dead center, 31 3/4 inches from the end (see the image to help you see where to make the bend points).  Hold the end you have just measured from in your right hand. About 11/2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end, begin bending the tubing. Bend a little, moving your hands farther down, then bend a little more. When you reach the first layout mark on the tubing, stop bending and check your progress.  Your goal is to make the tubing turn 90 degrees evenly between the end of the tube and the first layout mark. Adjust the curve being shaped by bending more (or unbending if necessary), spreading your efforts along the whole length of bent tubing. (Perfection is not required, and you will be able to make adjustments later.)  , Begin making a second bend along a horizontal plane, trying to complete a 90-degree turn by the time you reach the third layout mark. You should end up with a left-hand bend., Make the end bend as for the first end bend., The second curtain rod will be a mirror image of the first., Hold the completed curtain rods up to the curtain frame to check their alignment, remembering that they overlap at the center of the frame., The rods should curve around the outside of the larger holes (so that on opening night the curtain can follow the same path around the pole that will run through the holes). If the rods are out of alignment, bend them into position now., Slip the curtains onto them., Work the ends of the rods down into the holes until they reach all the way through the frame to the work surface., Drive the sheet-metal screws into the tubing until the screw head contacts the wood frame. This is an unorthodox use of screws and copper tubing, but with some extra force, the threads should bite into the copper and flare it right against the sides of the drilled hole.	Start with a lemonade stand. Attach the side pieces to the front pieces using brackets. Put to one side. Stack the two 1"x6" boards on top of each other with their ends even. Position the cut pieces on your work surface. Glue up the top frame. Lift up one of the long sides and put glue on the top surfaces of the two ends beneath it.     , Replace the piece.Repeat previous step with the other long side. Check the alignment one last time and try to get the top frame as close to square as you can. When the glue is dry, turn the top frame over. Put the 1 1/4-inch Forester bit in the drill chuck set the spur of the bit in one of the small holes you punched with the awl.     , Drill a hole all the way through the long side and the end piece beneath it. Turn the top frame upside down on your work surfaces, with the filler pieces facing down and the short sides to your left and right.On the other line, mark a point 2 inches (5.1 cm) in from the near edge of the frame. Reach across to the long side away from you and square a line 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from each edge at one of the far comers. Put the 5/16-inch bit in the drill chuck. Cut the ruffle cloth into three 12-inch-widc s tulips. Fold each piece in half lengthwise and run a hot iron along the folds. Turn the top frame so that the filler pieces face up and one of the long sides hangs about 2 inches (5.1 cm) off the front of the wad (?), Find the midpoint of one of the pieces of ruffle cloth. Make the first pleat. Make the next pleat. When you reach the end of the cloth, staple the end to the frame.When you get to the corner of the top frame, turn and reclamp the frame on the work surface and turn the corner with the fabric. Continue pleating until you reach the end of the short side. Go back to the middle of the front and repeat the pleating and stapling process, working to the right, until you have completed the ruffle all the way across the front and the other short side.     , Glue a long piece of ribbon along the top of the ruffle to hide the staples. Cut the curtain fabric in half.Lay one of the pieces of fabric flat on the work surface. On one of the long sides, fold over 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the edge. Repeat this process on both of the short sides of the top frame. Fold, iron, and staple the remaining long sides. Clip the curtain loops to one of the long sides of each piece. Uncoil the two lengths of copper tubing. When the copper tubing is straightened, lay the two lengths side by side. Grab one length of tubing in both hands. Grip the tube at the second mark (31 3/4 inches from the end, in the center), with the bent end on your right and pointing up. Hold the tubing with the unworked end on your left, the second bend pointing downward, and the first bend pointing toward you. Repeat. Place the curtain frame upside down with the 5/16 -inch holes in the corners closest to you. Insert the ends a short way into the 5/16-inch hole until the rods support themselves. Remove the curtain rods one at a time. Insert the ends of the rod back into the 3/16–inch holes. Set the frame on edge with its top surface facing you.
You should have a working knowledge of the short film format before you begin, so make sure to take in a short film festival or watch popular short films online.; , Make sure you have a good story to tell. Before you shoot, write down the complete story including action and dialogue. Make sure your story has original characters and dialogue, avoiding cliches. Try to keep locations and actors to a minimum, as each actor or location may increase your budget. Using only daytime locations will cut down on lighting needs, and using interiors will allow you more control over the set.  One script page is equal to one minute screen time. With that in mind, keep your short under 30 minutes. Film festivals program in 15 minute segments and they often want to include as many films as possible. Writing a shorter story increases your chance of being selected.  Using a simple spreadsheet, write down what you plan to spend on equipment, props, transportation, locations, actors, crew, and food.  Amateur film makers love to work on films. Find amateurs that have equipment you need, such as lights or a camera, and offer them a position on your film. See if there are restaurants that are willing to donate meals to your film production.  There are numerous websites devoted to funding independent art work. Try filming an interview with yourself discussing the film, or perhaps shooting a short trailer to drum up interest. Remember that spending too long on funding is a form of procrastination.  Use your friends, coworkers, or classmates as crew as often as possible. One area that you may want to pay special attention to is sound. The sound of your film can make or break the movie, so be willing to donate a slightly larger portion of your budget on sound.   A minimal crew should have a director, cameraman and sound person of course these people will have to do other jobs such as continuity and producing.  On a calendar work out when your cast and crew can make a shoot, do this several weeks before you film. From your screenplay, make a card for each location and on this card put all the scenes you need to film in that location. From this work out a plan for what you will shoot on each day factoring in:   That a day should be no longer than 10 hours, so its best to start early i.e 9 in morning. You should do at least two takes for each shot. It will take time to get to a location so keep filming local. It will take time to do a lot of camera and lighting set ups. Weather cover. What will you film if the weather is bad?  , For each shoot and audition create and event on Facebook, or any other social media commonly used by your team. This way it is clear when your shoot is and you can have discussions with cast and crew.  Doing rehearsals will save time when you are shooting and lead to better performances. Schedule at least two before your shoot and to make these effective write down beforehand what you want to achieve.  Film on weekends and after business hours to insure your crew will be able to work steadily. Keeping filming combined to two or three days will cut costs in both equipment rentals and meals. Use more than one camera.  The sound of your film can make or break the movie, so be willing to donate a slightly larger portion of your budget on sound.  Feed crew and cast well, this is essential to keeping up their moral. You could bring sandwiches, a flask of tea and or coffee, and a flask of soup.  Make money for post-production by throwing parties, dinners, or other events where you charge cover. Showing clips from your film will continue to drum up interest.  There is cheap, effective software currently on the market for both Mac and P.C. Purchasing the equipment may be a large initial investment, but it will pay off in time as you learn to edit your own films, rather than paying another editor. Logging, jotting down every take and marking good takes can save you a lot of time.  If you are interested in entering your film in competitions, be prepared to make DVDS of your film and pay festival entry fees. Before entering, make sure you follow all the terms and conditions required by each festival, and make sure the content of your film is appropriate for the festival.	Watch short films. Write a script. Keep your film short. Write a budget. Try to get everything for free. Begin fundraising. Gather your crew. Schedule. Use social media. Rehearse. Film quickly and cheaply. Pay special attention to sound. Take care of catering. Continue fundraising. Edit. Send to film festivals.
You will need this extra fabric to make the hem. If you are going to be hemming a skirt lining, plan on making it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the finished skirt.  Consider using a hem gauge to measure up from the bottom of the skirt to the cutting point. This will help ensure that you are cutting an even amount off all along the hem. If you don't have a hem gauge, you can use a measuring tape or ruler instead.   If you are cutting a skirt lining, cut it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the skirt itself.  Try to use a higher thread tension for this. This will help make the hem easier to fold later on. It will also create a sort of guideline for you, so you won't have to make as many measurements.Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric.  Lift the iron up and down as you press; do not move it side to side. You should have a ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) wide hem inside your skirt at this point.  Because the folding takes up some excess fabric, your hem will be about 5/8 inch (1.59 centimeters), as opposed to an exact ½ inch (1.27 centimeters)., If your sewing machine has an edge stitching foot attachment, consider using that instead.The edge stitching foot is often labeled as a #5 foot.Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric.  After this, your skirt is ready to wear.	Determine how long you want your skirt to be, then add 5/8 inch (1.59 centimeters) to it. Draw a line around the skirt where you need to cut it, then cut along that line. Using a sewing machine, straight stitch a line ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) away from the cut edge. Fold the hem inward, with the stitching right at the folded edged, and press it flat with an iron. Fold them hem inward by another ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron again. Stitch the hem down, 1/8 inch (0.32 centimeters) from the top folded edge. Press the hem one last time.
If you're not already familiar with it, deathrock sounds like a dark and oftentimes humorous mixture of punk, new wave, goth, glam and acid rock. Do not go into a Deathrock club requesting metal influenced artists like Marilyn Manson or Wednesday 13/Murderdolls lest you wish to receive a lot of blank stares - deathrock clubs don't play metal though they do play psychobilly, gothic rock, and '77 punk. Start off with the classic deathrock bands like:   Christian Death 45 Grave Specimen Sex Gang Children Southern Death Cult Sexbeat Alien Sex Fiend Virgin Prunes Blood and Roses Bonemen Of Barumba The Birthday Party The Gun Club T.S.O.L. Rudimentary Peni Red Lorry Yellow Lorry Burning Image Anorexic Dread Voodoo Church U.K. Decay Super Heroines The Flesh Eaters Phaidia The Lords of the New Church Kommunity FK Theatre of Ice The Last Days of Jesus Mephisto Walz The Naked & The Dead; ,, They own impressive vinyl collections. Develop a high tolerance towards extremely long and detailed discussion on what to do during a zombie apocalypse and whether you'd be better off owning vinyl, MP3s, tapes of CDs, and be prepared in defend your choice.  Remember your aesthetics, your body is art hence your attire is to-Do not merely dress for aesthetic pleasing of your friends an peers dress for yourself. Punk is at Deathrocks heart and punk is anti-conformity  , Leopard print, skeleton bones, and ripped fishnet stockings over your arms and legs (for male and female!) are often the best for the deathrock genre. Black is the main color, but a combination with any dark shade of pink ranging from purple to near blood-green will give that haunting effect for your outfit.  Political and sociological humor are a must, please do understand politics before stating "Down with the Right-Wing!" at a democratic caucus. Deathrock is unicorns and rainbows and unicorns and rainbows are a dangerous yet intellectual movement so be aware. , Deathrockers are at their core absurdists who believe the only things that give life meaning are relationships with others and creating art. So whether it's designing your own deathrock themed blazer, leather jacket, or just making your own band patches and band t-shirts, and possibly decorating your room or apartment, have fun with it and realize that creating things helps give life meaning.  Deathrock can be hard to find in some cities, so prepare to visit some goth, punk, Industrial and any horror themed rock concert too!	Listen to deathrock music to decide whether or not you actually like it. Then further expand yourself to modern deathrock bands like   Cinema Strange Christ Vs. Warhol Zombie Zex Bloody Dead and Sexy Tragic Black Old Cat's Drama Radio Scarlet Scarlets Remains Red Lipstick Death Black Cat Rebellion The Deep Eynde The Vanishing The Phantom Limbs Scarlet's Remains Justin's Behind Antiworld Black Ice Shadow Image Barney the Purple Dinosaur All Gone Dead Astrovamps Acid Bats The Proof Miguel and The Living Dead  , Deathrockers are huge music geeks, and lovers of obscure bands and equally obscure horror movies (especially zombie movies and supernatural thrillers). Slowly begin to develop into the aesthetics of the music no matter how macabre it may seem to you. Common punk attire and Mohawks (The common Deathrock variant known as the Deathhawk), Flamboyant make-up and clothes with a cryptic or macabre meaning are great. Develop a satirical sense of humour, everything has a meaning no matter how cryptic it is and that can be used for or against you so you might as well use it for your own means. Skepticism is the primary thing one needs to show often to an extreme level and ranging from anti-establishment/post modernism to anti-organized dogma.  , "Develop your meditating and cultivating skills". Go to clubs and experience new local bands and music.
The height of your cone will be determined by the radius of your circle. The larger the radius, the taller the cone. You can print the template in the document above, and trace the shape onto the paper you want to use. If you choose to make your own disc, do your best to make the shape as round as possible.   Improper measurements will have a big effect on your cone's result. It's a good idea to put extra effort into making the circle as round as possible. For your disk shape, you can also use a compass, or trace a round object, such as a lid or container.  Use the template to cut out two sides from the circle to make your wedge. To draw your own wedge, make a mark in the center of the disc. Draw out two straight lines from the center point to make a wedge with your ruler. If the lines are closer together it will make a smaller wedge which will result in a cone with a broad bottom.   Use a compass protractor to pinpoint the centre of your disc if you're unsure where to place your dot. If you're using a protractor tool to outline the disc to begin with, it can save you time to make the centre dot before you trace the disc around it. You can also draw your own triangle wedge using a ruler and pencil.  To make a cone with a small bottom, cut out a larger triangle wedge. Use scissors or a precision knife to cut out your wedge as straight as possible. If you run into any cutting mishaps, you will probably need to start over again., For your cone shape, bring one cut end of your disc over to the other in a cone shape. Hold it together and make sure the lower ridge of both sides overlap evenly. With this, your disc should have the desired cone shape you're looking for.   Unfurl the paper and try again if the sides don't meet properly at first. Don't make firm creases in your paper. Your cone should be rounded.  Once you tape the two sides side by side so that the paper makes a cone. Tape the inside of the cone by bridging the two sides so that they slightly overlap and bridging the overlap with tape. With that done, your cone should be ready to go.  One straight piece of tape will give your cone the best stability. Multiple pieces of tape inside will make a mess. It is helpful to have one hand applying the tape while the other holds the shape of the cone.	Make a paper disk. Draw a triangle wedge. Cut the triangle wedge out of the circle. Bring the cut sides of your disc together. Tape the inside of the cone closed.
The best time to deadhead or prune mums you are growing outside is during the late spring up to mid summer. This is right before blooming season, so the flowers have time to branch off from the cut stems. Deadheading during the warm season also makes it less likely that the vulnerable cut areas will be exposed to cold temperatures.If you are growing your mums in a greenhouse or indoors, you can deadhead them as soon as you see dead growths since the mums won’t be exposed to cold weather.; , When it’s time to deadhead your mums, inspect the plant to find the flowers or branches that are spent. Most mum blooms are orange or yellow in color when healthy, and brown when dead or dying. They also are likely drier than the other healthy flowers of the plant, often with a papery and brittle texture to their petals., If your mum plant only has a few dead blooms, you can simply pull off the browned flowers with your fingers. To do this, grip the stem of the mum right under the dead flower, then simply pinch and snap off the dead bloom.If you are growing your mum indoors or in a greenhouse, this method is probably best for you since you can continuously deadhead throughout the year and don’t have to worry about exposing your mum to cold temperatures.  If many of the blooms of your mum plant are dead, but the stalks appear to be alive and are growing buds, use a pair of garden shears to clip multiple flowers off at a time. Angle the shears right under the dead blooms and clip, taking off the blooms from a whole section of the plant. Repeat until you have taken off all the dead blooms., If most or all of the blooms and stalks on your mum plant are dead, you’ll need to use a pair of gardening shears to deadhead your plant. As soon as you see new green growth from your mum plant emerging from the ground, take a sharp pair of gardening shears and clip all of the dead sections of plant as close to the ground as you can. This will eliminate not only the dead flowers, but also the dead stems of the mum plant so that it can start anew.You may feel nervous about cutting off so much of the plant. However, if your mum is a perennial plant that went through a winter season, it’s necessary not only to cut off the flower but also the dead stems. Make sure that if you are doing a major deadheading that you do it during spring or early summer. This will give the new growths of the plant time to grow fully before blooming season in the fall.  Once your mums flower in the fall, you may be tempted to deadhead any dead flowers you see among the healthy blossoms. Resist this temptation if you are growing outdoor plants in a region that has a cold winter season, as clipping back flowers right before cold weather will leave your plant vulnerable.	Deadhead mums in late spring to mid summer. Find blooms that are wilted or dead. Pull off dead blooms with your fingers. Clip off bunches of dead flowers with shears. Shear at the bottom of the stem for major deadheading. Don’t prune outdoor mums after they flower.
Then, remove the exterior hardware (handles, lock cylinders, etc.).   If you have difficulty removing the hardware, you may simply mask the hardware prior to painting. The cabinet and drawers will have to be hand-sanded around any hardware that is left in place.  WD-40 and a razor blade work very well for this.   Spray some WD-40 directly onto the sticker and let it stand for a few minutes. Then, carefully use a razor blade or something else that will scrape the sticker away. Wipe away the excess WD-40 with an old cloth or paper towel.  If there is chipped paint, sand the chipped area with 220 grit sandpaper until it feathers into the remaining paint.   There is no need to strip the cabinet of all paint. Once you have sanded the chipped areas, use fine or very fine steel wool to rub down all exterior surfaces of the cabinet and drawers. This will flatten the glossy surface and make the paint adhere better.  Wipe the surfaces of your cabinet clean with household window cleaner.   This will remove any oily surface residue. Do it twice, then wipe it dry with a clean paper towel.  Make sure you are painting in a very well-ventilated area, and start by painting the drawers.   Set the drawers face up on a garage floor, patio, etc. Be sure the surface is protected with newspaper, cardboard or other cover. Note: Use ONLY spray enamel. Do not use a lacquer! Lacquer will eat up anything in its path, except other lacquer. Enamel is a safe bet over nearly any paint. To be sure, spray a test area that will not be exposed when finished.  Mask any hardware that hasn't been removed.   Use white or gray as this will make the final color more vivid. Recoat with primer within the time indicated on the can. Most enamels must be recoated within an hour. Otherwise, you will have to wait until the following day. Do not try to lay down one thick coat, because the primer will run and take a long time to dry. Spray all drawers then set them aside to make room for the cabinet.  Spray the sides of the cabinet lightly because you will be painting vertical surfaces and the paint is more likely to run.   Very light coats dry fast and can be recoated within a few minutes. Allow about five minutes between very light coats so the paint has a chance to set. This may require about four or five very light coats. Be patient! You may apply a slightly heavier coat to the top of the cabinet, as you will be painting a flat, horizontal surface. This is similar to painting the drawer faces.  Allow the cabinet and drawers to dry the amount of time recommended on the spray can before applying your color top coat.   If you create a design using masking tape, let the primer dry for at least 24 hrs. before taping, or the paint will peel when you remove the tape.  Flat paints have a “dusty” finish and do not clean as well if the surface gets dirty in the future.   For a high-use item like a file cabinet, it is best to use a paint that can be easily cleaned in the future.  Apply two light-to-medium coats of paint rather than one heavy coat.   Runs or drips can easily be brushed out while paint is still wet. This type of paint usually cleans well with soap and water.  Wait until paint is dry to add different colors or to paint designs over the final coat.   Using a roller adds an interesting texture to the paint. Replace the hardware or change it to something completely different depending on the look you are trying to achieve.	Remove the drawers from the cabinet. Remove any stickers or labels. Sand chipped paint to smooth the surface. Wipe the entire cabinet down to prepare for priming. Apply your primer coat to create a surface for painting. Spray a light coat of primer to start. Spray the cabinet with a very light coat of primer. Let the cabinet dry before painting a color top coat. Use a gloss or semi-gloss latex or acrylic based paint. Brush or roll on your paint. Wait for the paint to dry.
Button alarms, much like magnet alarms, are also common for windows and doors.Choose an exit point that is easily accessible, like one that is free of clutter and opens easily. For windows, you should prioritize those that are chest high, as these will pose less of a risk for falling injuries.   Falling from a second story window or higher could cause serious injury or death. For this reason, you should avoid windows this high., Push button alarms will oftentimes have a thin, plastic casing that has a button built into it. When a door or window is opened, the button is released and the alarm is activated.   In many cases, the button will be in the center of its casing and positioned in such a way that when fully closed, the door or the window fully presses it. Some button sensors may have a casing that contours itself so the sides of the casing form a cradle for the door or window. The button for the alarm is often located in the center of this cradle.  By placing an object over the button to keep it engaged, you can fool your button alarm into thinking that the window or door is still closed. Depending on your situation, how you do this may vary. In some cases, you might:Open the door or window in extremely tiny increments. Once the button is accessible, but still engaged, use a popsicle stick to hold the button down and keep the alarm from sounding. Use stiff card stock for sensitive alarms. Even opening your door or window a tiny amount might cause sensitive alarms to sound. Use a thin piece of stiff material, like card stock, and wiggle it between the space between the button and the door or window to hold the button in place.  To prevent setting off the alarm after you leave, you'll need to fasten your button blocker in place to prevent the alarm from activating. In most cases, you should be able to use a durable tape, like duct tape, to hold your button blocker in place and keep the button pressed.   Many doors and windows are painted. Be careful when applying tape to these surfaces. Sometimes the tape can damage the paint job when you pull it free.For more permanent disabling measures, you may want to glue your button blocker in place. However, doing so will make this point more accessible to burglars as well.  Your button blocker may be obvious on your window, so you may want to remove it after you're done bypassing your alarm. Since removing your blocker while the alarm is activated may result in you setting it off, you may want to wait until the alarm is turned off before you remove your blocker.	Determine your exit point. Familiarize yourself with the alarm. Block the button. Fasten your button blocker. Remove your button blocker when the alarm is disengaged.
Consider how you'll be moving around the festival and the distance from your car to the site you're either going to be sitting at or setting up a camp on. In most cases, backpacks are your best and easiest option. Suitcases will be hard to carry for any distance and tend to be bulky when moving past crowds of people and forget taking anything with wheels; the wheels will easily get bogged and won't turn over fields.   A trolley or a wheelbarrow could be helpful if you have space for such but only use something sturdy that has big wheels, especially if you're expecting mud. As well as the large bag, consider also having a small bag that you can carry your stuff in during the day when moving about the festival; either that or have clothing with large pockets unless pickpocketing is an issue, in which case keep all valuables secure, such as money in a money bag. CamelBak® packs can be great for festivals because they're hydration packs that allow you to carry water that can be obtained through an attached tube.; , You're obviously going to need a tent and sleeping bags. There are all sorts of mattresses available now that are lightweight; try picking one that doesn't require a pump to inflate it to make your life easier and to reduce the amount of items you need to carry in. For the lighter option, just sleep on your clothes. Pillows may seem like a luxury item but they make camping so much nicer and you can put it between your backpack and your back to carry it into the festival. Or, look for small camping pillows that can be scrunched up for carrying and that fluff out for use.  Festival clothing should be funky and fun- anything goes! However, you should also be considerate of the weather possibilities and be ready for all types of weather. Unless it's guaranteed not to rain, avoid wearing jeans as they just get clogged with mud and are miserable to be wearing if you're soaked through. Instead, wear shorts or short skirts and leggings/tights with Wellington boots (gumboots, rain boots) or lightweight pants used for hiking or biking purposes usually (choose ones that wash and dry quickly).   Sandals aren't recommended if you're planning on getting close to the stage - your toes will get squashed! Choose shoes or boots that protect your precious feet and toes should someone manage to stomp on them. Have flip flops or sandals for shower facilities though (if there are any) as you shouldn't stand in public bathing facilities without something on your feet. Some form of raincoat, poncho, or other rain gear is a good idea for the inevitable shower when you know the forecast promises such. Otherwise, you can easily fashion one from a bin bag, so be sure to throw some in for all purposes. A bandanna is a versatile accessory. It can be worn wet to cool you down and if you purchase one that has been impregnated with insect repellent, it'll keep the bugs off too. Plus, it keeps your hair out of your eyes and it looks cool.  Ideally this should be a collapsible water-carrier but a large soft drink bottle will do if you don't already have a water bottle. If the water bottle doesn't already have a carrying mechanism, purchase or make one so that you don't have to actually hold the water all day but can hang it on your body so that it doesn't bother you.  You're going to need to eat. How much food you take in and how much you buy there depends on (a) how much surplus cash you've got (b) how close to the stage your tent will be and (c) how much you're prepared to lug around with you. Here are some ideas for being self-sufficient:  If you're cooking you'll need to take along a compact and safe camping stove with fuel, a saucepan, and plastic/lightweight bowls, plates and cutlery. Another option is to take a flask and buy boiling water from stands at the festival to cook with (noodles and other instant food can be made by simply adding hot water to a bowl). And a can or tin opener is often handy to have (but if you have a Swiss army knife, this should suffice).       Rice, pasta,ramen noodles, and couscous come in a variety of "add boiling water" varieties. Try to pick at least one that come in a bowl/tub so you don't need to take so much crockery with you. Pot noodles work well, as do cuppa soups and instant custard.       Other food that won't spoil and requires no cooking includes: pepperoni, sachets of tuna, biltong/jerky, hot dogs, cheese strings/small cheeses, squeezy yoghurts, actimels, nuts/raisins/trail mix, lunchbox-sized smoothies, pita breads, breakfast or muesli/granola bars, chocolates/sweets and of course Pringles chips - the tubes protect them from being crumbed and can even double-up as an emergency loo in the middle of the night!       If you want hot drinks, consider packing teabags, coffee (pack it in a coin bag from the bank or small snack bag that seals), hot chocolate, powdered milk and any sweeteners.  Festivals wouldn't be festivals without plenty of booze. As with the food there's usually plenty to purchase on-site, but if you're taking your own then here's how to do it: don't take anything in a glass bottle. If it's found it will be confiscated owing to the potential dangers of broken glass hurting other people. Take beer or cider in cans, wine in boxes and decant spirits into small empty water bottles. If you're not fussy about the taste you can reduce your baggage weight by taking in concentrate for mixers such as orange squash and Ribena (blackcurrant cordial).   Remember to pack an empty bottle to mix your drinks in. You may also need energy drinks or energy and vitamin drink sachets. Know beforehand if the festival doesn't allow you to bring your own alcohol.  Everyone starts smelling the same during a festival, so this isn't the time to be overly fussed. Bring your toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush or comb, deodorant and for women, sanitary pads or tampons if needed. These should be all the items you need – leave the night creams and aftershaves at home. A small quick dry towel is a good idea if you intend using showers at the festival.  Bring along sunscreen and bug repellent. Sunscreen can melt in the heat so keep it wrapped in newspaper and keep it in the shade. Some festivals hand out sunscreen or provide it "on tap" to avoid leakage problems.        Baby wipes will keep you and your cooking utensils clean. Try to make as many things dual purpose as possible.       Pack plasters (mainly in case you get blistered feet), headache relief and throat lozenges along with any other medication you'll need.       You may want to have earplugs ready either for watching really loud bands or just if you want to get some sleep.  With a simple kit, you can come up with a solution to many broken or forgotten items. Pack duct tape, safety pins, string, elastic bands, pegs (clothes pins) and a whole roll of heavy duty bin bags. Bin bags have a multitude of uses - you can sit on them, make a raincoat, line your wellies (rain boots) if they split and to keep muddy clothes contained.   Other general items you might find handy to take include: Toilet paper rolls, a Swiss army knife, lighter, torch/flashlight (wind-up ones are great), portable phone charger (solar is perfect), zip-bags (to keep phone etc., dry in the rain), camera (with extra batteries/memory card), and cash in small denominations (changing large amounts is a pain at festivals).  Depending on what sort of festival you're off to, you may want to pack some of these more random items:    Flags, signs or placards  Fancy-dress, face-paint, wings, jewelry, makeup, temporary tattoos, etc. Magazine or novel, a pack of cards, games Glowsticks Binoculars Picnic basket Umbrella  Vodka watermelon or oranges Cigarettes (or make this the time to quit!) Condoms Disposable barbecue Cooler bag Friend's addresses for sending postcards from the festival.  Kids generally love festivals but it does require extra preparation to ensure they'll be happy and safe while there. Bike trailers are ideal to wheel them around in with all their 'stuff', but make sure you take a padlock or it will be nabbed by passing drunken revelers! Take a marker to write your mobile number on their arms, clothing and earmuffs for when they get sleepy or lost. Be sure to explain to them what they should do and where they should head for should they get lost at any time. Having rules in place about wandering etc., is much better than being wise in hindsight.   Take things to entertain them that don't make too much noise, don't require batteries and don't have lots of parts. Things like bubbles, poi, stilts and sparklers are great fun. Make sure they've got their own camera (even if it's just a disposable one), their favourite teddy (well named and with a phone number or email if lost!) and a fancy-dress costume. Have some sweets (candies) or other treats especially for your kids.  You'll need: Tickets, the festival location, a map/satnav/GPS unit, breakdown cover number (you may want to check that your breakdown service covers you for onward travel, some will just take you back home if you break down). If your car is small you may want to invest in roof bars and a roofbox. You may also need bungee cords to strap tents and other items to the roof.   Remember your sunglasses, in-car charger for your phone, and take CDs of bands who're playing at the festival to get you in the mood.

; ,, If the pitch of the harmonic sounds the same as the fretted note, then that string is ok.  The pitch generated by the harmonic is the natural pitch for reference.   If the fretted note sounds lower than the harmonic, then the length of the string should be shortened. Move the saddle towards the headstock. Try one millimetre at a time.       If the fretted note sounds higher than the harmonic, then the string should be lengthened. This is achieved by moving the saddle in the opposite direction to the headstock, one millimetre at a time.	Tune the guitar/bass as close as you can get it. Starting on the bottom string, fret the 12th note.  , Fret the harmonic at the same position. If the sounds are not the same, adjust the length of the string in order to re-calibrate its intonation. Repeat this process with each string.
While it is definitely possible to booty pop in heels, it may be a good idea as a beginner to wear comfortable shoes with traction or good grip to help you balance.   It might also help to practice in front of a mirror so you can watch your hips as they move.; , This will help you control which direction your hips are moving., Turn your toes out to a 45 degree angle.  Pretend you are sitting down in a low seat behind you, in a low squat.   Make sure your knees are over your ankles and there is no pain in your knee joints.  Press with your thumbs to move your hips forward.   Move your hips forward by pushing your hip bones forward with your thumbs three times.  Now that you’ve got the forward movement down, push your hip bones so they push backward.   Push your hip bones backward with your fingers three times.  Push your hips forward three times and then push your hips backward three times.   Make sure you remain in a low squat and your toes are turned out.  Now that you have the basic hip movements down, it’s time to try booty popping with no hand support on your hips.   Get in your low squat and place your hands on your thighs. Push your hips forward three times and then push your hips backward three times. If you want to emphasize each pop with a “boom!” or “bam!”, go for it.

Get down in your low squat, with your toes turned out and your hands on your thighs. Arch your lower back and stick your booty out so your hips are moving upward. Don’t start with your back caved in or your hips tucked underneath you. Pop your hips forward and then pop your hips backward to a quick tempo or count of 1,2,1,2,1,2.  Once you feel comfortable with the basic booty pop, or twerk, put on some music to try out your new moves.   While you can twerk to almost any song with a steady beat, it may be best to get in the with electro/dance tracks, as well as hip hop/dance tracks that have beats made for booty popping.Start with a song with a medium fast tempo and then once you feel comfortable twerking to the beat, move on to a track with a faster tempo. It may help to practice by turning to the side view in the mirror so you can watch your hips move backward and forward. Get down in your squat, arch your back, place your hands on your thighs and follow the beat to pop your hips forward and backward, forward, and backward. As you continue practicing the booty pop, remove your hands from your thighs and hold them out in front of you. Try to pop on double time, moving your hips faster to a song with a faster beat.	Put on comfortable clothing and shoes with traction. Place your hands on your hips. Place your feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees. Keep your hands on your hip bones. Use your fingers to push your hip bones backward. Put the forward and backward movements together. Try to pop with your hands on your knees. Speed up the booty pops. Try to booty pop to music.

Vegetables and flowers require at least six hours of full, continuous sunlight a day to thrive. Find a spot in your yard where there is a lot of direct sun for the majority of the day.You will want the plants to face south so they can get as much sun as possible. Make sure there are no obstructions like fences, posts, or trees blocking sunlight from the south.; , The garden plot should be on flat, even ground. This will ensure water is evenly dispersed in the plot and every grows evenly.   If you have to choose a spot that is sloped, you will need to terrace the beds by building them up with boards, flat rocks, or wood slabs.Make sure the spot is at least ten feet from trees and shrubs. You do not want the roots of trees or shrubs to get into the garden plot, as this can disrupt the plants. The shade of trees and tall shrubs can also negatively the garden plot.  Raised beds are boxed in wood above the ground. Raised beds are good for colder climates because the soil warms up faster in spring and you can plant sooner. This type of garden bed usually results in a higher yield of crops, especially vegetables.You can buy raised beds made of cedar or recycled plastic at your local hardware store. You can also build your own raised garden beds.  In-ground beds are more common than raised beds and are ideal for warmer climates. In-ground beds require less watering than raised beds. They also do not cost anything but they do require you to bend down to weed and maintain.In-ground beds are more susceptible to weeds and pests than raised garden beds. They also usually yield less crops.  Usually a garden plot will have several beds. Multiple beds allows you to grow several different plants in one plot. You can then rotate the different beds to have healthy crops every year. A smaller plot of 100-200 square feet can fit four to six beds. A larger plot can fit eight to ten beds.The beds should be 4 feet or less wide so they are easy to weed and tend. You should also include 21 inch (53 cm) pathways between the beds so you can roll a wheelbarrow through it. If you buy a raised garden bed box, you may not need to worry about having a pathway between the beds. Instead, make sure you place the boxes with enough space between them to walk through.  If you are putting the garden plot in your yard, you will likely need to remove existing top soil and grass. Slice under the sod with a spade and cut it into small handfuls. Then, take off the sod and put it in your compost or use it to patch up bare spots in your yard., Use a weed whacker or your hands. Look for common weeds like Japanese knotweed, bindweed, couch grass, and ground elder.You should also remove any surface garbage in the plot. Dig out any inorganic matter in the plot like bottle caps, plastic, or newspaper.  Use string and stakes to mark where the plot is going to be in your yard. This will make it easy for you to clear the area to prepare the plot for planting. Put stakes on each corner of the plot and attach string to each stake.  Having the soil tested will ensure the soil has the right balance of pH and nutrients to grow plants well. You can use a home testing kit to test the soil. You can find home testing kits at your local hardware store.You can send a sample of the soil to your local cooperative extension service or bring it to a garden center for testing.  Use a pickaxe or a pitchfork to double dig the soil so the new garden beds grow well. Dig to a depth of 12 to 18 inches (31 to 45 cm). Remove rocks and roots in the plot., Depending on the pH of the soil, you will need to add organic matter to improve the soil’s fertility. Add organic matter like compost, animal manure, plant manure, and sea soil to adjust the pH so the plants grow well in the plot.Layer 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of organic matter over the plot. Dig or hoe the organic matter into the top 6 inches (15 cm) of the soil so it reaches the root systems of the plants.  Use a garden fork or a rototiller to turn the soil once more. Break up any large chunks of soil and get rid of any stray rocks or roots. Turn the soil when the it is dry and not too wet. It should crumble easily when squeezed in your hand.  Once the soil has been turned, it is prepared and ready for planting. If you are planting tall vegetables or plants like tomatoes and cucumbers, you will need to put up barriers around the plot to protect them from wind. Use fencing panels, hurdles, or a hedge to protect the plot.	Pick a spot in direct sunlight. Choose a spot that is level and even. Use raised beds if you’re in a colder climate. Go for in-ground beds in a warmer climate. Decide how many beds you are going to plant. Get rid of the existing lawn. Remove all weeds and debris. Mark the plot with string and stakes. Test the soil. Dig the plot. Add organic matter to the soil. Turn the soil. Put up barriers around the plot, if needed.
Use a spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs in your engine and look them over to diagnose problems that may exist. Remove each plug and inspect them for specific types of damage that may indicate what’s keeping the engine from starting.Tan or grey metal plugs are in good working order. Black or burnt plugs indicate that there is too much fuel going into the engine. Blisters or boiling on the plug indicates that the engine was severely overheated.  If the spark plugs appear to be fouled out, you will need to address the issue that caused them to foul in order to make the engine run properly. Once done, replace the damaged spark plugs with new ones.Make sure to gap new spark plugs properly for your application. You can find the appropriate gap to put into the plug in the service manual for your vehicle.  Ensure each of the spark plug wires is securely fastened to the spark plug and to the ignition coil. You can also use an ohm meter to conduct a spark plug resistance test to ensure the plug wires are transmitting sufficient electricity to the spark plugs to ignite the air and fuel mixture within the engine.Look for signs of damage such as fraying or cracks in the spark plug wires. Replace any damaged spark plug wires even if they are not what’s keeping the engine from starting.  Although unlikely, if all of your ignition coils fail to function it will prevent the engine from starting. Test your ignition coils by removing a spark plug and connecting it again to its plug wire. Touch the metal from the plug to a piece of metal in the engine bay and have a friend turn the key in the ignition.If the coil is functioning properly, you will see a blue spark come from the plug. Test each ignition coil in your engine.	Check your spark plugs for signs of damage. Replace spark plugs if need be. Check the plug wires. Test the ignition coils.

Perhaps you are storing chemicals in your shed such as weed killer, pesticides, or white spirits.   You might also be storing petrol, diesel, oil or paints: all of these things are toxic. Some of these items are flammable; others like petrol can give off very noxious fumes, especially in a confined space like a shed. It’s very important that none of these chemicals are allowed to contaminate the water supply or the ground.  If you have any of the aforementioned chemicals in your shed, you can take some steps to ensure that they are stored properly. Here’s some basic advice for storage of chemicals in your shed:   Always keep chemicals in the original container. Store substances such as petrol in containers intended for that purpose. Petrol is corrosive and can wear away at containers not designed for storing petrol, leaking into water and ground and causing a hazard. Store chemicals out of reach of pets and children, in a cool dry place out of sunlight. Only buy as much as you need for the year. Chemicals in powder form should be stored away from, or above, liquids to stop drips and leaks that can cause chemical reactions. Avoid keeping chemicals past their expiry date. Dispose of chemicals safely and never down drains or into water.	Understand the dangers of storing your chemicals in your shed. Store your chemicals properly to stay safe.
The best way to prepare a home for a rainy season is to direct water away from it and make sure those runoff channels are solid. Check that the gutters are clear of debris and that the downspouts aren't clogged or loose. Consider pre-purchasing a gutter helmet to avoid having to clean out the gutters often. This will ensure that the spouts remain clear and unclogged all season.; , Look for obvious areas of weakness, such as warped or missing shingles or popped roofing nail heads. If you have an attic, see if you can see any daylight where the walls meet the roof. These are all indications of problems that could result in serious damage in the face of high winds and heavy rain.  If you've noticed some disconcerting signs in the attic or exterior of your home, it's time to make some changes. A professional home improvement company can check and find the extent of any roof damage. Before making any changes yourself, it's advisable to seek the recommendation of a professional.  If you're in an emergency weather situation and you don't have time to get a contractor out to see your roof, there are solutions. For missing shingles or holes, purchase a piece of aluminum flashing and a tube of rubber cement. This temporary solution will keep water out of your attic space. This is not a permanent solution though, just a quick stopgap until you can get it properly repaired. If you've noticed rotting or weakened supports, try reinforcing your eaves with galvanized metal hurricane straps. These small fixes can make big differences when it comes to damage mitigation.  Alternatively, upgrade the windows. If you live in an older home with single-pane, glass windows, consider installing exterior storm shutters. This seems obvious, but a lot of homes have merely decorative storm shutters or none at all. This leaves your windows vulnerable to high winds and flying debris. If your home was built before the 1930s, it probably has its original single-pane windows. Another option is to upgrade your windows to a stronger, more durable, modern design. Consider swapping your original windows for double-pane glass replacement windows.  While you’re inspecting your gutters, take a few moments to check where they connect to your downspouts. If they are loose or detached, make sure to secure them. Loose downspouts can easily blow away in high winds and create as much damage as blocked gutters. A seamless gutter system should diminish your fear of leaks or erosion for years into the future.  Extend your downspouts away from the house to keep water away and to prevent moisture from infiltrating your basement and foundation. Oversaturation of the ground surrounding your home can cause significant unseen problems that may not be caught until it is too late to do anything about them.  High winds and rain can cave in an old garage door. If you have an older home, consider adding some braces to your garage door to keep it stable during storms. Replacing a garage door can be expensive. Take some preventative measures to make it last as long as possible.	Focus on rooftops, gutters and downspouts. Check the roof for signs of weakness. Talk to a professional home improvement service, if relevant or possible. Do it yourself. Consider adding storm shutters to protect windows. Install a seamless gutter system. Make sure that the downspouts extend to the ground. Strengthen the garage door with horizontal bracing plates.
Just get down on the floor while placing your fingertips, or even your palms, all the way down on the ground in front of you. You can squat, with both feet equally positioned on the floor, on your toes. You can also use this position to get a bit more comfortable on your hands and feet, and to feel more secure in your balance. You can lean forward a bit until your palms are on the ground, and then bounce back to your feet. Repeat this movement a few times to feel more stable before you begin swinging one leg around.   Doing this can also help you figure out which leg you'd like to use as your "helicopter blade." See which foot you'd rather swing all the way around your body, and which one you feel more comfortable crouching on.; , Stick your leg out straight to the side. Your toes can be flexed and pointed up or just pointed down at the floor. Maintain your balance on both of your hands as you do this. Typically, if you're right-handed, then your right leg will swing around counter-clockwise. If you are left-handed, then your left leg will swing around clockwise.   However, it may be that you feel more comfortable crouching on your dominant leg and swinging around your other leg. You'll have a better sense of what works best after you try a few times.  Let's say you're using your left leg. If that's the case, then swing it clockwise, toward your right leg. As you do this, you'll lift up your left arm and hand so the leg can swing past it. One trick to maintaining your balance as you lift up one arm while swinging your leg past it is to plant as much weight as you can on your hands, leaning your chest over your hands, along with keeping your hips up high. This will help you maintain your strength and coordination as you lift up one hand, then the other.  You'll have to lift your hands up one at a time so the leg can pass through, but you have to keep one on the ground at all times to maintain your balance.   At first, you should do this slowly, but as you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do it so quickly that it'll almost look like your hands are leaving the ground at the same time.  You'll have to lift one hand, another, and then the other leg so that your "helicopter blade" leg can travel all the way around your body. You'll have to time it so your crouched leg lifts up while your other leg swings around so it can come right back down as soon as the leg passes through. Keep your chest forward, about even with your wrists, so you maintain your balance.  As you keep swinging your leg around, repeating the motion over and over again, you should avoid having it touch the ground as much as you can. If your foot touches the ground, then you may lose your balance as well as your momentum.   Also, if your foot just keeps going around and around without touching the ground, you'll be able to build more momentum and will gain speed, truly making your leg look like the blade of a helicopter.  As you develop your skills at the helicopter, you'll be able to go faster and faster, until you've truly mastered the move and it feels like second nature. You'll be able to fall into a rhythm and won't even think about when you should lift each of your hands and your crouched leg. Once you've got the basic helicopter down, here are some other tricks you can try:   Do the helicopter with your other foot out. Do the reverse helicopter, which is the same as the regular helicopter, except you'll be moving your foot back behind you and around instead of in front of you and around. So, if you normally use your left foot, instead of swinging it forward and clockwise, you'll have to move it backward and counter-clockwise. Transition into a more advanced break-dancing move. The helicopter is a basic break dancing skill, but the beauty of it is that it will allow you to transition into other more advanced tricks, such as the windmill, or the handstand.	Crouch down on the floor. Put out the leg you're going to use as your "helicopter blade.", Lift up the hand on the same side of your "helicopter blade" leg as you swing that leg past it. Plant the lifted hand back on the ground and lift your other hand as your "helicopter blade" leg swings past it. Jump over your "helicopter blade" leg with your other leg as the "blade" leg swings past it. Swing your "helicopter blade" leg all the way around to where you started, and keep swinging it around until you run out of steam. Keep practicing.
Ideally, most bands have a singer, lead guitarist, bass guitarist and a drummer. With other positions like keyboardist, acoustic guitarist or tambourinist, which are not used very commonly. A lot of Alternative Rock groups mainly focus on guitars. For example, Coldplay use a vast style of guitarists. Usually there are at least one guitarist and bass player, but ideally, you could have two guitarists and a bass guitarist. It is vital that you have a drummer and a singer, and it is quite helpful with a keyboardist.; , Having a good band name is VERY important. You can just use something random like 'Grim Skunk Violation' or something meaningful like 'Frozen Arsenal' the possibilities are endless! If you are stuck in finding a band name, use this site: http://www.1728.org/bandname.htm.  If you are at school, you could probably use a music room at break or lunch, or if you are out of school, you could probably rent a room for a small fee. You could even use your own garage, as long as your family is okay with it.  Each band usually has a designated song writer, but you may decide that everyone will write songs.  You could play at a fair, or charity event, if your council lets you. Eventually, after some concerts, you will start to attract fans!  , After a while, you should have a reasonable amount of fans, who should be looking for a CD of your tracks. On your album, you should have at least 6 songs, and a colourful cover and name for it.  Make a musician's account. Get your friends to send you Myspace to their friends, and so on. Pretty soon you'll have a whole fan-base!	Find musicians. Come up with a good band name. Find somewhere to play. Write songs. Hold concerts. Release a debut album. Make a Myspace account and upload your songs.
After 9/11 many American families have created special emergency kits to help them survive in the event of another tragedy. Regardless of the threat, an emergency supply kit can help you to stay alive during the early days following an outbreak or disaster. Items you should include:   Water. One gallon per person per day. If it’s possible, maintain at least a three day supply. Non-perishable food. Choose food that is easy to open, easy to store that does not attract bugs (or zombies). Also, select items that provide enough calories and nutrition to sustain life for several hours such as energy bars, peanut butter and nuts. If you have a baby, maintain a week’s supply of formula or baby food. Since you probably won’t be able to run your dishwasher, keep a pack of plastic forks, spoons, paper plates, paper towels and plastic cups on hand. Prescription and non prescription medication. Since you can’t anticipate when a disaster or zombie attack could possibly happen, always keep an extra month’s supply of prescription medicine on-hand. Non prescription medicine should include pain relievers, antihistamines and anti-diarrhea medication. First aid kit. You don't want to be bleeding all over the place regardless if you are running from zombies or trying to survive a natural or man-made disaster. Pack bandages of all sizes, blister bandages and a few ACE bandages. Include antibacterial cream to avoid infection. Toiletries. Most likely your electricity will be disconnected, so maintaining supplies that will keep you clean (and smelling fresh) will be vital to your survival. Include deodorant, waterless shampoo and antibacterial waterless hand soap. If you have a baby, don’t forget diapers and wipes. Tools. Put yourself in the shoes of a Boy Scout and think about the tools you might need to survive in the wilderness. Pocket knives, duct tape, flashlights, bleach, batteries, candles, matches and a hammer are a good place to start. Pet supplies. Don’t forget about the family pet. Same rules apply to Fido in terms of food, water and medication. Generator and gas. In the event you lose electricity following a disaster, keep a few cans of gas in the garage and have your generator primed and ready to go at any minute. Test your generator every year to ensure it’s still in working order and have it flushed after each use.; , Chances are you will be taken by surprise during a disaster of zombie-like proportions and in order to stay one step ahead, gather the troops and have a “what if” discussion. Review the family’s daily schedule and identify a “go to” safe spot in the event of a disaster like a zombie attack. Determine how you could come together as a family once the area has been deemed safe or cleared. Could you walk home if necessary or will you require car, bus or train transportation? If you typically ride public transportation and there is no way you can walk home, identify a peer who has a car and find out if you could get a ride, should disaster strike. You should also consider what to do if you can’t locate a member of your family. Who will be elected to go on the search and when? Ultimately your best bet would be to communicate by cell phone, however you can’t depend on the network to be up and running--that’s why a solid emergency plan is imperative.  During emergency situations, "good" people can do terrible things. In addition to having to worry about the usual dangers lurking outside, anarchist looters may try to move in and take what’s rightfully yours. Think about what it will take to secure your home and personal property from harm’s way.   Examine all locks on windows and doors. Do you have any doors or windows that don’t close properly or are broken? Have all entryways to your home evaluated by a professional to ensure that no one could forcefully enter your home? Lock cars and secure recreational toys such as motorcycles, boats and jet skis. Bring in outdoor items that could be used as weapons or could become air born. Looters (or angry zombies) could use items such as large potted plants and lawn furniture to smash windows. Also, during a hurricane or tornado, those items could become flying "missiles" and create endless amounts of damage.  Every disaster situation is different and hopefully government agencies are communicating with the public every step of the way. However, during the early days following an outbreak or disaster the public is often on their own. Examine your unique situation and consider the safest way to conduct yourself until help arrives.   Look for dangerous patterns within the community. If you know that you will be in the most danger at night, don’t go outside at that time. Be hyper-aware of your surroundings and never let your guard down while in public or outside. Make your trips into the community brief. In addition to being worried about being eaten during a zombie attack, most disasters will wreak havoc on structures--power lines may be down and on the ground and building materials may line the street. You could actually survive the disaster but then be electrocuted because you didn’t see the downed power line on the sidewalk. Practice safe behavior. If you could become infected with a deadly disease or be attacked on the street, don’t spend your day hanging out in the town’s square. Use your common sense and make every effort to avoid trouble.  From national to local government agencies; many have planned for a variety of disaster scenarios and should have a hardwired plan ready for implementation. Stay informed by trying to contact your local officials first and then state and national groups if you don’t get answers immediately.  You don’t have to be suspicious of the little old lady down the street, but it’s good to know which neighbors will have your back. Keep a list of emergency friends and family members near your emergency kit. You may want to have a discussion or an agreement with neighbors before disaster strikes to know how you can help each other.	Stock up on emergency supplies. Have an emergency family plan. Secure your property. Know what you are up against. Have emergency names and numbers on-hand. Know who you can trust.
Sweep picking sounds best with a Strat-style guitar and a modern tube amp. You also want to use a pick that's between 1 and 2 millimeters thick and has a more rounded tip./images/thumb/e/ef/Sweep-Pick-Step-1-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-1-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/e/ef/Sweep-Pick-Step-1-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-1-Version-6.jpg          Set the gain on your amp to a moderate amount. You want each note to have uniform volume and sustain, but if you set the gain too high, it will be virtually impossible to mute the other strings. Make sure your guitar strings are all at the same intonation. Using your neck pickup will help reduce a lot of noise.; , One of the easiest ways to learn how to sweep pick is to isolate each hand and get the technique down correctly. Once both of your hands know what to do, all you have to do is get them working together./images/thumb/4/40/Sweep-Pick-Step-2-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-2-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/4/40/Sweep-Pick-Step-2-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-2-Version-6.jpg          When you sweep pick, you essentially let the pick fall from string to string in one smooth, continuous stroke. Imagine that your hand is being pulled by a string tied to your wrist. Release the tension in your hands so you're holding the pick loosely. Keep the pick moving at whatever tempo you've chosen – don't stop to pick each individual string. If you break the momentum of your picking, you'll have a hard time being able to sweep pick clean and fast., One method that can get your strumming hand used to gliding or sweeping over the strings for sweep picking is to take chords you know and like, and arpeggiate them to articulate each note./images/thumb/d/de/Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/d/de/Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg          Doing this also will get you used to how slowly your hand actually needs to move, even if the notes are coming relatively quickly. Keep in mind that what you're doing right now is not sweep picking, because the strings continue to resonate as you play. To sweep pick, you must learn how to mute all the other strings except the one you're fretting.  Rolling your fingers to mute a string immediately after playing it is what gives a sweep picked arpeggio its distinct sound. Your barring finger should be extended and slightly arched so you can rock it back and forth./images/thumb/e/e8/Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/e/e8/Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg          Essentially, the first knuckle of your finger is going to collapse to mute the string immediately after playing it. If you're just starting to learn to sweep pick, your fingers may have trouble with this unfamiliar movement. Do exercises to limber up your fingers and improve their agility. One exercise you can do is to simply extend all your knuckles on both hands so that your fingers are straight. Then gently press your opposing fingertips together. Hold for about 5 seconds, then release. You can do this exercise as many times as you want, just make sure not to press too hard., If you watch master sweep pickers play, you'll notice that their hands don't actually move all that much, or move all that fast – relative to the barrage of notes they're playing./images/thumb/3/3e/Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/3/3e/Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg          Faster playing comes from making more efficient movements, not from moving your hands faster. You can do finger strengthening exercises to increase the power and efficiency of your fingers and hands. This well help you sweep pick at a faster tempo.  To sweep cleanly, your pick and your fretting fingers must make contact with the string you want to play at exactly the same time. This can take practice to do with precision./images/thumb/d/d4/Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/d/d4/Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg          If you've mastered the technique that you should use with each hand, it should be easier to coordinate them than if you're struggling to learn those and trying to coordinate at the same time. Go slowly at first, focusing on your two hands acting in unison. Keep in mind it is possible that your more dominant hand is going to be faster than the other, so keep your practices at a slow tempo and gradually build up to faster speeds only when your hands are naturally synchronized. Synchronizing your hands is one of the most difficult parts about sweep picking, and it's one that can only be achieved with practice. There aren't any special exercises or drills you can do that will improve this for you.  As you're practicing sweep picking and working on your technique, a metronome can help you maintain the same tempo and keep your hands synchronized./images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg          Start with your metronome set to eighth notes. It may seem slow to you at first, but stick with this speed until you have progressed to doing six-string arpeggios. Once you've mastered six-string arpeggios with eight notes, you can gradually move up to sixteenth notes.  You want to ensure that only one string is sounding at a time. All other strings should be muted with your other fingers as you fret the string you want to play./images/thumb/3/3f/Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/3/3f/Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg          When you play, you should only be fretting one string at a time. Your remaining fingers have the work of muting all the other strings. If the other strings are sounding, you'll just sound like you're strumming a chord – there won't be any separation between the notes characteristic of a sweep pick. Keep in mind that the practice of muting the other strings may be one of the more difficult parts of sweep picking to master. Be patient and take your time as you practice. When you're just starting, it might help to fold a washcloth and secure it to the frets with a large rubber band. This will mute the strings for you and prevent unwanted noise.  If you're finding a particular area of an arpeggio difficult, it may be because your fingers can't move efficiently to play those notes. Work on the notes that give you problems by themselves./images/thumb/1/1d/Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg /images/thumb/1/1d/Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg          You can create your own two- or three-note drill out of the portion of an arpeggio that you find difficult. Drill it, first with each hand by itself, and then with both hands together, until you can play it as cleanly as you play the rest of the arpeggio.  Once you've got the fundamentals of sweep picking down, you may want to go in for a session or two with a guitar teacher who can watch you play and show you where your technique is sloppy./images/thumb/c/c6/Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg /images/thumb/c/c6/Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg          If you have a friend who is skilled at sweep picking, they also may be able to help you figure out how you can improve. You might also watch videos online. If you can videotape yourself, you can compare your own sweep picking to the hands of someone on a video who has mastered the technique. This is another way to identify areas where you can improve. Break down the job of each individual finger on your fretting hand, so you can figure out which finger isn't doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing and work on that movement.  Sweep picking can take several months to do cleanly and correctly. However, you can improve little by little if you take just a few minutes each day to work on your technique./images/thumb/7/70/Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/7/70/Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg          In addition to practicing your sweep picking mechanics, you also want to practice scales, so your fingers will become accustomed to moving through basic patterns. You also might practice your hammer-ons and pull-offs, which can improve the speed and efficiency with which you roll your fretting finger when sweep picking., Once you're drilling different arpeggios, practice by spending about five minutes fretting the arpeggio without strumming. Then spend another five minutes picking the arpeggio without fretting./images/thumb/0/0e/Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/0/0e/Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg          Do this first with two-string sweeps. Once you've mastered the mechanics of two-string sweeps, isolate your hands again to learn the movements with three-string sweeps, and so on. Keep in mind that if each hand hasn't mastered what it's supposed to do, it will be much more difficult to have your hands working in synchronization.  When you're just learning to sweep pick, two-string sweeps allow you to work on the mechanics and synchronize your hands, because neither of your hands has to move very far or very much./images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg          Two-string sweeps also can help you with muting, because you'll only have to roll between two strings, essentially switching back and forth between them. You also can do basic sweeps based on arpeggiated chords, which you can build yourself using chords you already know.  When you've mastered two-string sweeps, move on to three-string sweeps, then four-string sweeps, and so on. Stay at the same tempo as you progress and focus on keeping your hands synchronized./images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg          When you start working into longer arpeggios, break them down into four-bar sequences and practice the shorter parts. Once you've mastered each sequence, you can start putting them together.	Use the right gear. Start with your strumming hand. Try slow-strumming chords. Learn to roll your fretting fingers. Prioritize efficiency over speed. Synchronize your hands. Use a metronome. Mute the other strings. Identify parts that are giving you problems. Work with a guitar teacher. Practice every day. Spend time at each practice isolating your hands. Start with two-string sweeps. Work your way up to six-string sweeps.
This is the step where we tell you to make sure you are legally allowed to dig your bunker. If you excavate illegally and someone finds out, you will face a fine and have to fill it in, or your council will fill it in and charge you for the privilege.; , The below stages are listed in order that they occur, but each stage needs to be considered before the project is started.  Digging a bunker under a home has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include that the entrance to the bunker can be concealed, and it is easier to supply electricity, etc.   Disadvantages are many. Messing with the foundations of a house can be disastrous. Access will likely be poor, perhaps preventing heavy machinery which will make things slow and difficult.       Excavated soil may be more difficult to remove, or may create a messy trail through your home.       You may have to dig through a concrete floor, which requires heavy equipment which will need to be rented. Pockets of natural gas, radiation, and mold all may be encountered during the construction of the bunker, and this is not ideal with your home is directly above. You do not want to poison your family as they sleep, or cause the whole house to blow up as methane escapes. Damp and mold are also unwelcome.       Generally, it's better to choose a site distant from any building. The best place is away from any trees, as their roots will make things harder.  Soil type also needs to be considered. Sandy soil is more prone to cave in. Clay is less likely to collapse. Rocky soil is difficult to dig out.  Depending upon where you are in the world, you may have to think about what effect cold weather will have on the ground. When the ground freezes and thaws, the soil expands and contracts. This may lead to collapse.  Ideally, you want to know what is beneath your feet before you start. Will you hit bedrock straight away? Where is the water table? You do not want to return the next day to your site to find it flooded. Do your research, know your soil.   The site also needs not to interfere with any underground cables, pipes, etc. This is another reason to build away from structures. Seriously consider getting a professional involved to advise you about a site.  You can use a backhoe or excavator to excavate out a large hole, then place or build a structure inside the hole, and then finally use the excavator to bury the structure again. Mini backhoes can be hired if you want to do it yourself, or the larger ones can be hired with an operator (e.g. for the day).   Dig down as far as you want, and keep the excavated soil close by, but far enough away from the hole so that it does not fall back in. Remember the pile of dirt will become very large very quickly. Soil in the ground is compacted, and when it is dug up it occupies more space.       When you have dug as deep as you require, make sure the surface is level. It is easiest to place a manufactured structure in the hole, and a shipping crate is a readily available and passable for this purpose. They are not too expensive, but you may be surprised how much they cost, even old ones. However, it will need to be lowered into the hole, and this will require more heavy machinery.       An alternative is to build your own structure in the hole. The floor needs to go down first. Take a while to plan the materials at this stage, it can mean the difference between damp and moldy and comfort. Cemented bricks or concrete blocks are a cheap and strong material for the walls. Using wood for the structure is not desirable, they will rot if you use untreated wood, and treated wood releases toxic chemicals that are unsuitable for an underground bunker. Wood is also less permanent and less strong than brickwork or cement blocks.  The second, slower and more dangerous method is to dig out the bunker from the entrance and shore up the tunnels as you go. This is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing. Try to always have a phone, (call for help if you survive and are then trapped by a cave in), and a light. Leaving an emergency shovel and water to hand may save your life.   This kind of digging can be a nightmare and can be very slow. It is also much more likely to lead to collapse. The ideal plan for this kind of bunker is a large circle shape. If one part collapses you can still get out round the other side. You need to take great care with how you shore up the walls and roof, with planks at first, but ideally solid brickwork.       Scaffolding poles can be used to prop up the ceiling, but this approach should not be trusted to secure larger rooms, only passageways. Use brick pillars instead of scaffolding poles for a more permanent measure.       If you hit solid rock, you should have chosen a better site. You need heavy equipment to break it up, or you can drill a hole and place explosives and then try to blast it out bit by bit (not recommended). You can hammer wooden wedges into cracks to try to break pieces off. If you live somewhere cold, try pouring water into the cracks and then leaving it overnight. The water expands when it freezes and may break pieces off.    Water-proofing the bunker. A simple plastic sheeting laid below the floor, and similar measures for the walls and roof may be needed to prevent water and damp seeping in.       Sound-proofing of the roof and walls. This way your bunker will remain undiscovered even if loud music is playing and it is near the surface. You do not want to live in fear and have to whisper.       Concealing and securing the entrance. This is more difficult if the bunker is in the middle of open ground. Consider planting quick-growing trees or landscaping the ground around to look natural. Another idea is to make the entrance look like a manhole cover. Another option is building a shed or other small structure on top of the entrance. An entrance is much more easily hidden inside a building, below the floor.       Power. A generator, or electric supply from the surface. Ventilation. In deeper installations, air needs to be circulated with vents and fans. Do your research.       Water supply and lavatory. Main water supply may be interrupted during a disaster. Look into rainwater collectors and water purifiers. To have a sustainable toilet within the bunker, a septic tank and leach field will be needed, but the tank needs to be emptied and the leach field rested at intervals (years). Another option is the composting toilet.	Check the legal and zoning requirements. Plan and research every aspect in great detail. Think carefully before committing to a bunker under your home. Consider soil. Plan for the cold. Get to know your landscape. Consider using heavy machinery. Go without machinery if desired. Consider other finishing touches and safety measures.
You wanted to make just one track ? Well, Hardcore is certainly one of the hardest music genre, and thus, finding people who truly enjoy it, finding tutorials or label interested (this will come much later after you start producing) WILL be hard. Are you sure you want to become a Hardcore producer ?; ,   What is a DAW ? It's a music producing software; if you didn't know it then you will probably need a lot of time before actually producing tracks. Personally, I use FL Studio, but you can also try one of the various others, like Cubase, Ableton, Pro Tool, Reason, Logic... Keep in mind that some of them only work on PC, while some other only work on Mac. Some also work on both. Tip the name on a search engine, then go to the website and download a demo to get an idea of how it works. But keep in mind that if you illegally download the software, the music you'll make won't belong to you.    It may contain extremely useful tools that will make producing music easier and funnier, as well as giving more qualities to your tracks. Look for tutorials on YouTube and WikiHow.    These will help you create your sound, may it be the drums, the melody... Don't buy expensive one at first : If you are a beginner, why would you need hundreds of virtual instruments if you can't even understand one?  ,   You'll want them to sound as "neutral" as possible : what does it mean ? Well, if you used your mobile phone speaker to make your music, you would try to make it sound as good as possible... on your mobile phone. Your track could be heard anywhere : In a club, in a car, in your room... and what sound awesome on your mobile phone speaker will sound like %#?! on your computer speakers.    This is a simple question, with a long list of answers. We'll go for the technical ones, which are the one that will interest us : Hardcore is a kind of powerful techno, with heavy kick and bass that usually resort to distortion. The tempo is usually between 150 and 200 BPM, although faster genre exist (Speedcore can be at 300 BPM and higher; Flashcore use ultra fast BPM and "kicks barrage"). Use the definition to make your tracks. What is the structure of a track ?  ,   Try to make the perfect kick, the perfect melody... At first, don't try to make a track. I'm sure you won't follow this advice; but mastering the instruments before trying to play is a good idea.  It doesn't have to be original, awesome or anything at first : You're just practicing, and this track might never get known by somebody other than you or the neighbors. ,,   Make it better. Proceed to next step.    Mixing isn't just what a DJ does at nightclub, this is was a sound designer does. If the guitarist of a band play too loud, you won't hear the voices, the other instruments, and the overall will sound like garbage. You will need to add effect, adjust volume to almost everything so the end result will sound good. ,   While this tutorial cover some of the basis, you will need to do your own research on the web. Go on dedicated forums, ask your questions, see how the other do this and that.  Thus, some important things essential in studios aren't mentioned, like the need for reference speakers. If you seriously get in the music production, these will definitely helps. Having panels to avoid sound echoing and altering the sound you hear will help... If you already know how to make music.	Make sure you want to do it. Choose your DAW. Master your software. Choose your VSTs. Get some good speakers (monitors) for listening. What is Hardcore ?, Practice make perfect. Try to make a track. Create the kick for your track; it need to be loud and distorted.  , Complete the track with other things : a lead, more instruments, maybe pads...  , Listen to your track. Learn about mixing. Listen to other people tracks (and listen to professional ones too) and understand how a basic track is made : Pre-intro, break, intro, break...  , Google is your friend. Please note :   All of these steps assume that you are a beginner in music production.
With the right programs and equipment, it's not difficult to measure the decibel level of a sound using your computer. Listed below are just a few ways to do this. Note that better recording equipment will always give you better results — in other words, while your computer's default internal microphone may be sufficient for some tasks, a high-quality external microphone will be much more accurate.   If you're on Windows 8, try downloading the free Decibel Reader app from the Microsoft App store. The app uses your computer's microphone to read noises up to 96 decibels.Similar devices are available from the iTunes app store for Apple products.You can also try using a third-party program to measure decibels. For instance, Audacity, a free sound recording program, includes a simple built-in decibel meter , For measuring sound levels on the go, mobile apps can be extremely convenient. Though the microphone on your mobile device isn't as likely to be as high-quality as the sorts of external mics you can connect to a computer, they can be surprisingly accurate. For instance, it's not uncommon for readings from mobile apps to be within 5 decibels of the readings from professional equipment.Below is a brief list of decibel-reading apps available for common mobile platforms:   For Apple devices: Decibel 10th, Decibel Meter Pro, dB Meter, Sound Level Meter For Android devices: Sound Meter, Decibel Meter, Noise Meter, decibel For Windows phones: Decibel Meter Free, Cyberx Decibel Meter, Decibel Meter Pro  , Though it's not usually cheap, perhaps the most direct, accurate way to find the decibel level of a sound you with to analyze is to use a decibel meter. Also called a "sound level meter", this specialized tool (available from online retailers and specialty stores) uses a sensitive microphone to measure the amount of noise in the environment and give you a precise decibel value. Since there isn't generally a large market for these tools, they can be somewhat expensive — often at least $200 even for low-cost models.Note that decibel meters/sound level meters can go by other names. For instance, another type of tool called a "noise dosimeter" performs basically the same function as a standard sound level meter.	Use your computer. Use a mobile app. Use a professional decibel meter.
Use an orbital buffer for faster results, but keep in mind that it's more difficult to control the amount of finish that your polish removes. It can also create deep scratches if any dirt or debris comes between the buffer pad and the vehicle. If you use an orbital buffer, use it on the slowest setting available to ensure that you don't remove too much paint from your car. Use a hand-polish technique for greater control. Applying car polish by hand with a soft cloth takes much longer, but gives you greater control over the process. It is also less expensive than an orbital buffer.; , If there is any dirt or debris on your car, polishing will grind it into the finish. Be sure the car is completely dry before you begin polishing.  If you're using an orbital buffer, turn it on after you've used the pad to rub some of the polish on the car to prevent splattering.   Apply more pressure at the site of the scratch if you're working only on a scratched section of your car. Gradually reduce pressure as you move away from it. This will help the newly polished area blend in with the rest of your car. Work slowly and do 1 small section at a time if you're polishing your entire vehicle. Use plenty of polishing paste, and take care to keep your cloth from drying out.  Finish working on 1 area entirely before moving on to the next, so that the polish does not have a chance to dry on your car's finish before you've rubbed or buffed it away.	Decide whether you want to use an orbital buffer or hand-polish using a soft cloth. Wash your car thoroughly. Apply the polish to a soft cloth or the pad of your orbital buffer, and rub it in a circular motion on the car. Continue to rub or buff the area in a circular motion until the polish disappears completely. Finished.
Remember that when you make a braid, each length of yarn will shorten considerably, so double the length at a minimum.; , The three colors should complement or match each other and it's ideal if they are intended for certain color schemes within your own wardrobe.  Place them side by side with care, so that they meet up together.  This will keep the three lengths together evenly while braiding.  Braid from the knot down the length of the yarn.  This length can be ascertained from the length of the clip, barrette or other hair accessory you're going to be adding the design to.  This will prevent the braid from unraveling. The braid piece is now ready to be attached to the hair accessory.  If it isn't clean, remove any dust or grime first, and allow to fully dry before proceeding.  Add glue to the accessory's surface first, then align the piece of braid to the surface. In some cases, you may find that it also helps to add the glue to the braid as well as to the surface of the hair accessory.   Be sure to use glue that is suitable for both the yarn (fabric) and for the hair accessory. , This might be a spray-on varnish or a brush of Mod Podge. This is to protect the surface from wear and tear.	Measure out a length for making the braid with. Choose the thread colors. Align the three threads together. Tie a knot about one inch from the end of the thread lengths. Begin braiding. Stop when you reach the desired length. Tie another knot at the end of the braiding. Ensure that the surface of the hair accessory is clean and dry. Use a strong glue to attach the braid to the hair accessory surface. Allow the glue to dry completely.  , Add a sealant layer.
To ensure your doorknobs don't get primed or painted during this process, you should remove handles and any other features, like clothes hooks, from your door.If you do not plan on removing these from your door, you might:   Prevent hardware from being painted by taping around the edges of fixtures, or even taping the entire fixture.  Use fine grit sandpaper, between 180 and 220-grit, while stripping old, flaking paint and smoothing rough edges.A power sander or coarse sandpaper might cause scoring in your door, leaving unsightly notches or lines in its surface.  Take a clean rag or paper towel and wipe your door free of any dust, dirt, or grime.   Do not use water. If water soaks into the material of your door, it can have a negative effect on how the primer and paint bond to the surface., By tackling your door one side at a time, you accomplish two goals at once. Your careful attention to one side at a time will help ensure evenness and consistency for the whole door. This will help you achieve a professional looking finished product.  Primer helps to prepare the surface of your door for the actual coat of paint. Some surfaces, especially those that are rough or absorbent, can be difficult or expensive to paint if unprimed.You'll certainly want to prime your door if:   Your surface is unfinished. Your door is made of bare or stained wood. You want to paint the door a color lighter than its current color., The specific brand of primer that you bought should have instructions for how long you should let your primer dry before applying paint. Follow these directions for best results, but when in doubt, allow 48 hours to pass before applying your paint.  But first, you should give it a once over to make sure that it is clean. Dirt or dust that might have been on your sawhorses could have rubbed off on your door. Using a clean rag or paper towel, wipe any dust or grit off the door before priming.   Be sure not to get your door wet. Wetness on the door can prevent your primer and paint from bonding with its surface.	Remove or tape around the edges of fixtures. Sand the door lightly. Clean your door, if necessary.Your door may have accumulated some dust or grit in the sanding process. Repeat sanding and cleaning on both sides. Prime your door. Allow your primer to rest. Prime the reverse side of your door.
The single largest cost associated with getting convicted of a DUI is your car insurance. In every state, you are required to have a minimum amount of car insurance in order to drive. The cost of that insurance will vary from state to state. When you are convicted of a DUI, your insurance company will increase your premiums to take account of your increased risk. These premium increases can cost you thousands of dollars a year.   For example, in California, it is estimated that a DUI conviction for a teen will cost them around $40,000 in increased insurance premiums over 13 years.; , When you get convicted, the court will most likely make you take classes as part of your punishment. These classes are meant to teach you about the dangers of driving under the influence and how alcohol affects your body. If classes are required, the court will make you pay for them out of your own pocket.   For example, in California, a DUI class runs about $650., After you are arrested and charged with a DUI, you will not be able to continue driving your vehicle. Therefore, police will have to have it towed and impounded. When police do this, they will send you the bill.   In California, for example, the towing and storage fee is around $137 per day, and your car is usually impounded for a minimum of five days. Therefore, the total cost associated with this aspect of a DUI is around $685., DUI convictions carry heavy fines, usually in the thousands of dollars. Each state will have different amounts. In addition to court ordered fines, you might choose to hire a lawyer to help you through the legal process. If you do so, this will cost money as well.   In California, it is estimated that legal fees and fines add up to about $4,000 in a DUI case., A lot of states will automatically suspend your drivers license when you are arrested for DUI or if you refuse to take a breathalyzer test. If your license is suspended as a result of a DUI, you will have to pay the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to get it reinstated.   In California, the DMV reinstatement fee runs about $100. In total, with every cost considered, a DUI can cost you around $45,435., Apart from money, a DUI can lead to a lot of consequences that cannot be monetized. These costs should also be considered when you are attempting to minimize your DUI footprint. For example, your license will be suspended and you will not be able to drive, you might spend time in jail, you could be put on probation, you will have to spend a significant amount of time in court, and you might hurt someone., When you are first arrested and charged with DUI, your first thought might be to hire the most expensive lawyer in town to help you. However, while the cost of a lawyer often correlates with their experience and expertise, it is not always true. In fact, if you search diligently, you can often find a great lawyer at an affordable price. When you start your search, ask family and friends for recommendations. This will help you avoid hiring a lawyer you know nothing about. When friends give you ideas, ask about the cost of the lawyer's services.   Once you find a few candidates, sit down with each one and discuss your case. If your case is straightforward (e.g., you are going to plead guilty or enter diversion), your lawyer might only charge you a small flat fee. In more complex cases, the lawyer might charge by the hour. If this is the case, try to negotiate a reasonable fee. If you really like the lawyer but their fees are too high, ask if you can pay with property instead of cash. Some lawyers will accept cars, art, and other pieces of property in lieu of cash payments.  If the lawyer you hire is being paid by the hour, sit down with them early and discuss your case. The complexity of your case will depend on the facts surrounding your DUI arrest. If you admitted to being intoxicated and you took a breathalyzer test that proved it, you may want to consider diversion or pleading guilty to a lesser charge. The earlier you do these things, the less your lawyer fees will be.   However, if you have a strong case because the police improperly collected evidence or in some other way made a mistake, it may be worth the extra legal fees to fight your DUI. If you win, the extra legal fees may be offset by the amount of money you save in insurance premiums and court fines.  One of the best ways to minimize legal fees is to listen to what your lawyer says while they are representing you. If your lawyer tells you that you do not have a strong case and you should consider diversion, do not keep paying your lawyer to fight the case. On the other hand, if your lawyer tells you you have a strong case, do not plead guilty just to stop paying your lawyer.   Paying attention to your lawyer's advice can help you avoid unnecessary costs while making strategic legal choices.  Soon after you are charged with a DUI and you hire a lawyer, you need to sit down with them and discuss your case. Your lawyer will talk with you to determine the strength of the government's evidence, defenses you might have available, and the risks of getting convicted of DUI.Based on these factors, your lawyer will decide whether you might have a good chance at getting a plea deal. In general, there are two types of plea deals you can make.   First, your lawyer can help you plead guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for the prosecution dropping the DUI charge. In a lot of cases, you will have to plead guilty to something like reckless driving. Second, if the prosecution is moving forward with the DUI case, your lawyer can try to negotiate a reduced fine and/or sentence., During the early stages of strategizing, you and your lawyer will have to assess your case's likelihood of success. The stronger the prosecution's case is against you, the more you will want to make a deal. However, when the prosecution's case is strong, it also means they will not need to concede as much during plea negotiations. Therefore, the more you and your lawyer understand about your case, the more prepared you will be when you start negotiating.   The prosecution will have a strong case if you made some admission of guilt, you took a breathalyzer test that showed you were intoxicated, and the evidence shows that law enforcement followed procedure. In addition, the higher your blood alcohol content (BAC) was, the weaker your case will likely be. You will have a strong case if you invoked your right to remain silent early, you refused a breathalyzer test, and when the evidence shows some misconduct or shortcoming on the part of law enforcement., Your lawyer or the prosecutor may initiate plea negotiations. If your lawyer is initiating, have them call the prosecutor and set up a time to meet. Before the meeting, make sure your lawyer is preparing by looking over sentencing guidelines and other court materials. These things will give your lawyer an idea of what the prosecutor might say. In turn, this will help your lawyer make convincing counter arguments and suggest a reasonable solution., Remember that the prosecutor does not need to agree to anything. While the prosecutor might have a motivation to save court costs and free up time, if you do not make reasonable concessions, the prosecutor will likely walk. Again, this is why it is so important to understand the strength of each side's case. The stronger the case is against you, the more you will have to concede.   However, do not give up everything. If your case is moderately strong and the prosecutor is trying to bully you into a bad deal, you can always say no., When a deal is reached, make sure you get it in writing and make sure it covers absolutely everything. Most prosecutors will have to get deal approved by supervisors, which can take some time. If you fail to negotiate a complete deal and the prosecutor has to ask for approval more than once, you could be wasting time and the supervisor may be less willing to accept it., During plea negotiations, try not to show your entire hand. Avoid laying out your entire litigation plan and telling the prosecutor how you plan to fight the case. When you do this, the prosecutor may take a deal off the table because they will know exactly how strong your case is. Additionally, never admit guilt during negotiations.While a lot of courts will not allow that type of statement to be used in court, it could indicate to the prosecutor that you have a weak case., If the judge signs off on your plea agreement, you will have hopefully minimized the cost of your DUI. When your plea deal dictates that you pay smaller fines, make sure you pay those fines on time and in full. When your plea deal dictates that you plead guilty to a lesser offense, make sure you do so.   If you fail to hold up your end of the agreement, the plea deal could be revoked and you could face the full DUI charge and possible penalties.  A lot of states offer diversion programs to help cut certain people a break. Diversion can be legally advantageous because it allows you to have your DUI dismissed so long as you comply with your agreement with the court. In addition, while diversion costs a significant amount of money, it is undoubtedly cheaper than being convicted. However, not everyone is eligible for diversion programs. For example, to be eligible for diversion in Oregon:You must not have had a DUI in the last 15 years Your current DUI must not involve injury to others You must not have a commercial drivers license You must have appeared for all court dates You must have filed a petition for diversion within 30 days of your first appearance in court  , When you request diversion, you are entering into an agreement with the court. In exchange for a dismissal, you have to do certain things the court may require. In Oregon, the first thing you must do is pay $490 in diversion fees. If you cannot afford these fees, talk to the judge. They may have the ability to waive a portion of the fee if you qualify., The court might also require you to get checked out by a prevention specialist. During these assessments, counselors will determine whether you have an addiction to alcohol and/or an alcohol abuse problem. The court will require you to be truthful during these assessments and if you are not, the court can cancel your diversion.   The court will also require you to pay for this assessment. In Oregon, the assessment fee is $150., If your assessment determines you have an alcohol problem, you will be required to enter treatment. During treatment you will work with addiction specialists to try and get your alcohol problem under control. You will be required to pay for any treatment you receive. The cost of your treatment will depend on the length and intensity of your program. For example, an in-patient program will be more expensive than an out-patient one.   If you cannot afford to pay for treatment, talk to your judge. They will determine how much you will have to pay and whether any portion of the fee can be waived., As part of your diversion agreement, you will probably have to attend a discussion about how driving under the influence can affect others. Most of the panels will include speakers who are past DUI offenders, often ones who have injured or killed others because of their actions. Each panel member will speak about their experience and how the DUI has affected their lives. After the discussion is over, you will usually be able to ask questions and make comments.In Oregon, you will be required to pay to attend the event. The cost can range anywhere from $5 to $50., Throughout your diversion period, which can last 180 days or longer, you must comply with all laws concerning the use of illegal substances. Regardless of what type of DUI you were charged with, you must refrain from using drugs like cocaine and marijuana. While it may or may not be illegal to use these drugs in your state normally, the rules are more strict when you are in diversion.If you fail to stay away from drugs, your diversion privilege will be revoked and you will not receive a refund for anything you have completed prior to being kicked out.  During diversion, you will also not be allowed to drink any alcohol. However, there are a few limited exceptions. For example, you can drink sacramental wine given to you as a part of a religious ceremony. You will also be able to take any drug, including alcohol, if it is taken pursuant to a valid prescription.If you fail to stay away from alcohol, your diversion might be revoked and you will not receive a refund for any money you paid up to this point.  Some states, for example Oregon, require you to use an ignition-interlock device in order to drive. These systems require you to take a breathalyzer test prior to turning on your car. If you do not have any driving privileges, you will not have to install one of these systems.   You will have to pay to have the system installed. You will also have to pay leasing fees and maintenance fees. If you cannot afford these fees, talk to your judge. They may be able to waive some or all of the fees depending on your circumstances., Throughout the diversion process, the court will put your DUI case on hold. If you comply with all of the diversion requirements, the court will dismiss the DUI charge.Most people can complete the diversion program in around 180 days.   In total, diversion might cost around $4,000. However, this is a lot less than the $45,000 it might cost if you are convicted.	Consider insurance premium increases. Think about DUI classes.

Try to remember the lyrics, or at least the parts when some big step is coming up. Write down those lyrics you need and make sure you can get a CD with your piece of cut music so you can practice at home. Play the song a few times and get the beat in your head.; , Look closely at your instructor and take note of how his/her feet are pointed, how her arms are bent, and detail. Take a mental note and make sure you write down each move and correction later. Take a notebook to class if you have one so you can write down little corrections you need to make and practice on. This really comes in handy at home. Know the moves and when to do them. This is very important, and in your notebook, write down each step and put the lyric of that part beside it.  At home when you're watching TV and a commercial is on, or when you're waiting for your bagel to pop out of the toaster, practice your moves! In your notebook, pay attention to every little detail and if you practice, you will improve. Get the gist of the moves in your sad so you know you're going in the right direction.  Your instructor may make corrections and give you helpful tips. Know what you're supposed to wear and how to do your hair, as this is very important too! Bring your notebook to rehearsal in case anything changes.  Hand them your notebook and crank up the music and ask them to pay close attention. Let them make corrections, and list the pros and cons of your dance. You will also get good practice in front of an audience.  Ask her how you did and listen carefully and hang on to every word she/he says.  Smile and enjoy, but have your parent's, friend's, and instructor's voice echoing you head, and say the steps in your head as you do them. You should do fine and make each and every move just perfect!	Know what song you're dancing to. At dance class, pay close attention. Practice every chance you get. Go to all rehearsals. Have a friend or parent critique you. When you think you're ready, show your instructor one time before you perform. Go out and do your best!
If you want to stay informed about a carnival stopping in your area, you can always search online to find out more about its history. Enter the carnival company’s name into a search engine and combine it with search terms like “safety” or “accidents.” There’s also a non-profit organization that keeps a detailed record of all international amusement park mishaps: http://www.rideaccidents.com/   Try not to be suspicious or afraid of all amusement park rides, since the vast majority are safe, well-maintained, and issue-free. However, if you’re curious or concerned, you can find out if a particular ride or company has a history of issues. You can also check to see how those issues were resolved.  Local regulations vary widely, so if you want to evaluate a ride’s safety or inspection history, it’s wise to stay informed about your local laws. For example, in the United States, some states have essentially no inspection regulations whatsoever for traveling carnival rides.The best way to check your local laws is to go to your state or other local government’s website. Look to see if they have a public safety section, or run a general search for amusement park safety regulations. Check your local regulations to see how often rides must be inspected, who the inspecting body is, and what kind of insurance companies are required to hold. If you live in a jurisdiction without any regulations, consider doing more research about a particular carnival company’s safety history. In the US,  Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah have no government oversight or inspection of traveling carnival rides., In the US, many states don’t require carnival rides to be inspected by government employees, but do require some oversight. These states allow companies to be annually inspected by private third-party inspectors. If you have any concerns, you can call the carnival ahead of time and ask who they hire to conduct inspections.You can then contact the inspecting company and request more information about the carnival’s safety history or more information about a particular ride.	Research the safety histories of a ride and a carnival company. Check your local jurisdiction’s laws. Look up a ride or carnival’s inspection history.
If you live in a rainy environment or frequently ride on wet, muddy trails, go for a wet chain lube. It's thicker, so heavy downpours and mud won't wash it away. If you live in a drier climate, choose a thinner chain lube marked for dry conditions.You can find wet and dry bicycle lubricants online or at a bike shop. Make sure to use only lubricants marked for bicycles. If you frequently use your bike in both wet and dry conditions, buy one of each lube.; , It’s best to thoroughly clean your bike’s chain before you lubricate it.Spray a clean rag with a bicycle degreaser or WD-40. With the bike in a work stand or propped up, grasp the chain with the soaked rag and use your hand to pedal the chain through the rag.Pedal the chain through the rag until each of the chain’s links have passed through the cleaning rag two or three times. Repeat the technique with another clean rag to wipe away excess residue and dry the chain. Note that while some manufacturers advise using WD-40 as a cleaning solution, it’s not a proper lubricant on its own.  Touch the lubricant container’s straw nozzle to one side (either the inside of the chain closest to the frame or the outside) of the top of the bike chain. Spin the pedals forward to move each of the chain’s links past the lubricating nozzle. Once you’ve spun the chain in two complete rotations, repeat the process on the other side of the chain’s top.Try not to apply too much lube as you pedal the chain. A little goes a long way, so just apply a thin stream. Wiping away excess will help make sure you cover the nooks and crannies.  Use a similar procedure to lube both sides of the chain’s bottom. Touch the nozzle to the inner and outer sides of the chain, and rotate the chain twice for each side. Pedal backward when you lube the bottom of the chain, instead of pedaling forward as you did with the top side., You’ll need to get rid of excess lubricant after you’ve lubed the inner and outer edges of the chain’s top and bottom. Grasp the chain with a clean, dry rag and pedal forward to move the chain through the rag. Continue for two or three rotations, or until you’ve wiped away all the excess surface lube.Wiping away the excess surface lube will help reduce dirt and debris from caking up your chain.	Choose a wet lube if you ride in the rain. Clean and dry the chain before lubricating it. Lube the top of the chain. Lube the bottom of the chain. Wipe away excess lubricant.
Look in your own fabric supplies, in your wardrobe for unwanted clothing, in thrift stores and in craft stores for great sources of fabric. Some examples include:   Leftover scraps from sewing projects Cut-outs of fabric designs that you love Cut-outs from beloved pieces of clothing that are past their wearing date (great for memory sakes of children's clothing) Quilt fabrics/fat quarters Special fabrics like tulle, organdy, silk, satin, etc. Thread, wool, yarn, string, ribbons, lace, netting, etc. Sewing embellishments such as buttons, sequins, sew-on patches, etc.  Fabrics tend to come in a range of textures and thicknesses, meaning that you'll need to incorporate these differences to best effect in the collage.  There are some suggestions for backgrounds outlined above but always bear in mind that fabric may stick differently from paper, so not all options will be useful. Do a test glue on the background you'd like to use before proceeding, to make sure that the fabric will stay in place. Some ideas for backgrounds include: other fabric, an unwanted wall-hanging, an item of unwanted clothing, paper or cardboard, an object such as an old stuffed toy needing a facelift or a lampshade, etc.   Use clear drying glue that is suitable for both fabric and the backing you're using.  For design ideas, see the suggestions outlined in the method above for making a paper collage. Once you have a design in mind, match the appropriately textured and colored fabric pieces accordingly., It's fine to stick one piece on top of another, so be bold.   Keep the textures in mind when creating impressions of items, animals or faces. For example, use wool or fluffed up fabric to create a sheep's body or use yarn to create hair around a face. Wool, thread or yarn can be wound around in spirals to create flowers, a sun or moon, faces, etc. Buttons and sequins are great for all sorts of image creation, such as making flowers, eyes on a face or animal shapes.  Place on display.	Collect the pieces of fabric you're going to use for making the collage. Check the textures. Select a suitable background. Create the design on paper by drawing it into place. Cut and arrange the fabric materials following your design. Allow to dry.
Slowly pour a small amount of the epoxy stripper into a metal container or can.Since the product should be applied incrementally to small surfaces areas, do not pour out a large amount at once. Apply the product to surfaces up to 9 square feet (0.83 square meters)., Dip a paintbrush into the stripper. Brush the stripper onto the surface that has been painted with epoxy paint. Be sure to brush in one direction only onto small surfaces., The paint stripper should remain on the epoxy paint for about 15 minutes. This will give the product enough time to break down the chemicals in the epoxy.The instructions may vary from product to product. Be sure to follow the suggested time in the instructions. During this time, consider leaving the room to limit your exposure to the paint stripper.  After 15 minutes, use a paint scraper to scratch the surface of the paint. If the paint lifts away, it is ready for removal. You may have to apply multiple coats to fully remove the epoxy paint., Use a paint scraper to lift away the epoxy paint. At a shallow angle, place the metal blade of the scraper onto the surface of the epoxy paint. Apply pressure and push the scraper away from you to lift up the paint.If you are working with wood, be sure to move in the direction of the wood grain with a plastic scraper to avoid damaging the surface. Consider using a toothpick or a toothbrush to remove the epoxy paint in nooks and recesses., After you have removed the paint, wipe the surface area with a damp washcloth or towel to neutralize the pH balance. Caustic strippers can be cleaned with vinegar and water, while others can be cleaned with mineral spirits. If you used a methylene chloride stripper, use mineral spirits to clean the surface as water can damage the surface of wood., Paint strippers can disturb the pH balance on a wooden surface, which can cause problems if you wish to repaint the area. Use pH papers to check for a pH level of 7.Place the test paper on the damp surface of the clean surface, and compare the reading on the paper to the pH key provided.If the pH level is too high, wash the area again and test once more in a few days., After you have removed the epoxy paint, let the surface area dry. Point fans toward the surface to help speed up the drying process. Depending on your climate, it may take up to a week to completely dry., Carefully pour any unused stripper back into the container, and wash your tools and work surfaces with water and soap. After removing your protective gloves, wash your hands with cold water and soap.	Pour the solution into a metal container. Use a paintbrush to apply the solution. Leave the product on for 15 minutes. Test to see if the stripper is working. Loosen the paint with a paint scraper. Wash the surface area. Test the pH level. Let the area dry. Clean up your work space.
Daffodils that have been planted in containers need a bit more attention than ground-planted ones. After flowering ends, top dress your container with a fertilizer such as bone meal.   Bone meal can be quite stinky, so you may prefer to keep the container outside for a day or two afterwards.  If you intend to keep your bulbs in the same container until the following year, give the flowers time to fade completely - usually about two months. At this point, the foliage should have begun to die away.   Once the flowers are gone, turn the container on its side for about 3 months and avoid watering it.  Turn the container right-way up again in the fall and give it a good watering. This watering is necessary for the bulbs to flower again the next spring.   Daffodils prefer an acidic soil, so to counter the alkaline effects of tap water you can add a little Ironite (a mineral supplement) to the water. Alternately water them with rainwater.       If you live in an area with severe winters, bring your containers inside in the winter as the narcissus bulbs will not fare as well in pots during freezing conditions.  Daffodils will survive for up to 3 years in a container, but the flowers will never be as good after the first year.   For best results, plant the spent bulbs outside after the foliage dies back and replant your container with fresh bulbs and fresh compost for the following flowering season. The method for transplanting spent narcissus bulbs from a container to the ground is outlined in the section below.	Fertilize container-planted narcissus with bone meal. Allow the flowers to fade and avoid watering. Care for the narcissus through the fall and winter. Consider planting the spent narcissus bulbs outdoors.
When going uphill on a dirt bike, position your stance so that your body weight is being pushed forward. This will add to your momentum. The rest of your stance should remain the same as when riding on flat ground.   Squat with your knees bent a few inches off the seat with your feet on the foot pegs. Keep your legs locked and knees grabbing onto the tank. Elbows should be bent with arms locked. Keep your head and shoulders straight, leaning forward almost over the handlebars.       While gripping your handlebars, cover the brake and clutch with your middle or index finger. Keep your grip loose by using only your index finger and thumb. Keep your wrist as straight as possible. Be alert and ready to grab the brake with your fingers from the handlebars.      ; , Before climbing the hill, gather as much speed as possible on your drive towards the hill. Maintain this momentum as you climb the hill.  As you go up the hill, shift gears to prevent the bike from bogging or dying out. Once the bike bogs out you will not be able to recover.  Giving too much throttle will cause the back end of the bike to slip, however not enough throttle will cause the front wheel to rise. Practice climbing hills so you get the right feel for throttle control.	Sit in the correct position. Build momentum. Shift gears. Control the throttle.
This will count as your first stitch. To make a slipknot, fold some yarn in half to make a loop in your non-dominant hand. Then, bring the tail end over the working end of the yarn so it crosses. Use the thumb and finger of your non-dominant hand to make a single loop, and poke your knitting needle through this loop. Gently tug on the yarn and yarn tail to tighten the knot.       ; , Push upward until you form a loop.  The tip of the needle should be pointing towards your thumb.  Make an upward motion with the needle as you do this.  Make the loop snug, but do not make it too tight.  Both the cast on loop and the slipknot should be the same size and tension. You may need to tighten or loosen the knots to do this.  Each cast on equals one stitch. The slipknot also counts as one stitch.          Try not to make knots too tight, or you won't be able to knit into them later.	Make a slipknot and slide it onto your knitting needle. Hold the needle in your hand and wrap the yarn around your thumb from behind the working yarn. Bring the needle in front of your thumb and the strand of yarn. Slip the needle under the yarn around your thumb. Pull your thumb out and tug on both strands of yarn. Push the loop down towards the slipknot, and adjust if necessary. Keep repeating the steps until you have the number of stitches the pattern requires.
You can knit the brioche stitch in the round or using two straight needles. A bulky weight yarn is ideal for this stitch, but you can also use a thinner yarn if you prefer. If you are trying the brioche stitch for the first time, then you will need:two balls of bulky weight yarn in two different colors or two balls of the same color a pair of US 13 straight needles or US 13 circular needles for knitting in the round a stitch marker (only if knitting in the round); , Choose one of your colors to begin with and cast on as many stitches as you like. If you just want to practice this stitch, then 20 stitches is good amount for straight needles, or 36 stitches for knitting on the round.         Make sure that you cast on an even number of stitches.You can turn your practice project on straight needles into a scarf or turn your practice project on the round into a hat.  To purl to stitches together, put your right needle through the next two stitches on the left needle. The right needle should cross in front of the left needle as you do this. Then, wrap the front piece of yarn around the right needle and pull it through the two stitches on the left needle.As you do so, slip the stitches off of the left needle. The stitch on your right needle will replace them.“P2 together” is the abbreviation for purling two stitches together.  Take the strand of yarn that is in front of the needles and pull it up so that it is in front of the most recent stitch on the right needle. Then, insert the right needle into the first stitch on the left needle as if you are going to purl this stitch. Instead, slip the stitch off of the left needle and onto the right needle.The yarn over is often abbreviated as “YO” in knitting patterns., After you have completed the sequence of P2 together and YO, then you will need to repeat it until you get to the end of the row or round.         If you are knitting on two straight needles, then you can just turn the stitches around when you get to the end of the row and then continue working the pattern the same fashion. If you are working the brioche stitch in the round, then you will need to change the pattern for the second row.  If you are knitting in the round, then you will need to grasp the piece of yarn that is behind the stitches before you can begin the second row. You can just let the other piece of yarn hang down in front of your stitches. You will not need to use it until you get to the next round., Just as you did a yarn over for the purl round, you will need to do yarn over for the knit round. However, this time you will need to keep the strand of yarn behind the left needle and insert your right needle behind it. Then, slip the stitch off of the left needle and onto the right needle.  Next, instead of purling two stitches together, you will be knitting two stitches together. Insert your right needle through the next two stitches on the left needle, and then wrap your yarn over the right needle. Holding the yarn taut, pull the yarn through the two stitches and allow them to slide off of the left needle as the new stitch replaces them on the right needle.Knit two together is abbreviated as “K2 together” in knitting patterns., You will need to continue to YO and K2 together until the end of this round. Then, you will switch back to the purl row pattern.   After you have achieved the desired length for your project, then you can cast off your stitches and finish your knitting project.	Gather your materials. Cast on your stitches. Purl two together. Do a yarn over. Repeat the process to the end of the row. Hold the other strand of yarn behind the stitches. Do a yarn over on the first stitch. Knit two together. Continue to follow this pattern until the end of the round.
Now that you know how to blow bubbles, you can start playing fun games with your friends. Give everyone a wand and see who can blow the most bubbles in one breath. Remember that a steady, even flow of air will create more bubbles than a strong burst!  , This is another fun game to play with friends. Have everyone start at the same time and see who can blow the biggest bubble using the small-sized wand. If you have a friend who's sitting out, ask them to take a picture!  , If you made a giant bubble wand, it's fun to see whose bubble will last the longest without popping. You can make the game harder by having the contestant move jog in place, put their hand inside the bubble, or bend up and down - all without letting it pop.  It's like regular darts, only a lot more fun! Have someone blow bubbles in front of the dartboard. The person throwing darts should try to pop as many bubbles as possible to get points for his or her team.  This is a great activity for a rainy day, when you want to play with bubbles but you can't go out in the sun. Blow a bubble and carefully transfer it to a plate. Gently place the plate in the freezer. Check it out in 1/2 an hour or so - it should be frozen solid.	See who can blow the most bubbles. See who can blow the biggest bubble. See who can create the strongest giant bubble. Play Bubble Darts. Make a frozen bubble.
For many in today’s world of communication, CB radio seems like an outdated method of contact. CB radio still has many benefits depending on how you use the device. For desolate environments, like mountains or deserts, CB radio can be the most effective device to contact people.The radio signal is short wave, so you can only contact those in a 40 to 100 mile radius, depending on the device/antenna you have. You should probably have a contact you are planning to communicate with using the CB radio. Another use for CB radio is for safety contacts. If you are going on a long road trip through desolate areas, CB radio can be a vital tool to connect with the police.; , You can purchase a CB radio from stores like Walmart, other general supplies stores, or online. Consider what you need the radio for to help decide what price you want to spend. If you are using the radio for fun between friends, don’t spend more than $50. If you are setting up a radio communications system for work, spend a little extra for a reliable machine., The most common place to mount a CB radio is in your car. It is important to mount the radio in a location that won’t impinge your safety while driving. A common place to place your radio is underneath the driver’s seat. This ensures that you won’t mess with the radio while driving.Some CB radios come with mounting hardware that will require you to modify your vehicle. Only the larger, older models require you to do this type of installation. Smaller CBs don’t require any serious installation and can work in the dashboard. Check the mounting instructions before purchasing the CB radio.  You can get large antennas for a wider range in service, but will require more time to install. There are small profile antennas that are only 2 feet, like the Walcott, which can even be used on motorcycles. The best place to mount your antenna is on the center of your roof.Depending on what antenna you have, you might have to drill holes into your vehicle. Check the installation requirements of the antenna before purchasing it. If you want an easier installation process, you can invest in a magnetic antenna.	Understand CB technology. Get a CB Radio. Mount your device. Select and mount an antenna.
