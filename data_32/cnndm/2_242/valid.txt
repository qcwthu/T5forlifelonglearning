A heavily pregnant woman and her seven-year-old son have been found shot dead at a home in rural Queensland alongside the body of a 52-year-old male relative in an apparent murder-suicide. Police believe the father's death is not suspicious, while his 27-year-old daughter and her son's death are being treated as suspicious. Three gunshots were heard coming from the home on Sunday night at around 10.30pm but police were not called to the scene until Monday evening. 'There was one shot and then some time difference between the second shot,' Detective Inspector David Isherwood said. The man's other daughter reportedly discovered all three bodies at the home in Biddeston, in the Toowoomba Region, on Monday at around 6.45pm when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs.

Adorable footage of a puppy Husky talking back to its owner has appeared online and it’s making quite a stir. The clip features  baby Ramsey whining while attempting to speak, much to the delight of Texan owner Kayla Cagnola, who holds the puppy in her arms. Trying to perfect what appears to be either a howl or her skills in conversation, the dog looks down on the room and begins yapping while struggling to break free. Ramsey appears to be attempting to perfect her skills in conversation by howling  in a frenetic manner . Reacting to a howl, the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog – seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what Ramsey is trying to say. According to the Huffington Post, the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate’s dog food. There are several theories as to how dog-human communication has evolved over the years. Looking around the room, the puppy begins its high-pitched yapping while struggling to break free . Some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral, group-living wolves. While others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative. As for howling, dogs do this for a range of reasons including: locating other pack members, keeping strangers away, or calling the pack for hunting. The dog's owner Kayla Cagnola laughs hysterically while trying to interpret what puppy Ramsey is trying to say . Dog's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance. Whether these apply to Ramsey – who appears to just like making high-pitched noise – however remains to be seen. So far the original video has been viewed over three million times on YouTube. The original video uploaded to YouTube by the dog's owner has been viewed over three million times .	Ramsey attempts to have a conversation by howling frenetically .

A photographer is hitting back at a 'cyber bully' and critics after her photo shoot with a military family featured their baby boy wrapped in an American flag. Vanessa Hicks, 29, from Virginia Beach posted pictures from the photo shoot onto her Facebook page on Sunday, unaware that they would receive negative feedback. The image shows Landon Clevenger, at the time eight days old, from Virginia Beach being cradled in an American flag held by his father, Rodney Clevenger, who is wearing his U.S. Navy uniform. Scroll down for video . A photographer is hitting back at a 'cyber bully' and critics after her photo shoot with a military family featured their baby boy wrapped in an American flag. The image shows Landon Clevenger, at the time eight days old, from Virginia Beach being cradled in an American flag by his father, Rodney Clevenger, who is wearing his U.S. Navy uniform (pictured above) Vanessa Hicks (above), 29, from Virginia Beach posted pictures from the photo shoot onto her Facebook page on March 8, unaware that they would receive negative feedback . However, a community business page on Facebook, 'You Call Yourself A Photographer?' posted Hicks's image of Landon and Mr Clevenger criticizing the use of the flag. The group wrote that the flag is 'not a prop' (the post above) Hicks said her intention was to honor the U.S. flag while also honoring the parents, as Clevenger's wife, Samantha, also served for the country as a former US Army member, and he has served as a sailor in the US Navy for six years, according to ABC News. The family wanted to include their military service in the photos said Hicks. The mother-of-three and Navy veteran who served for four years said the image she took illustrates what Mr Clevenger was fighting for - the American flag. 'I have seen first-hand what is desecration of the flag,' said Hicks of her time in the Navy. 'At the end of the day I didn't do anything that disrespected this flag.' However, a community business page on Facebook, 'You Call Yourself A Photographer?' posted Hicks's image of Landon and Mr Clevenger criticizing the use of the flag. The group wrote: 'The flag is not a prop. I repeat: The flag is not a prop. To use the American flag in such a way is disrespectful, rude, tacky, disgusting, and against the U.S. Flag Code.' It continued detailing the 'key points' of the code including that the flag should never touch anything beneath it. The post concluded with: 'Mr. Clevenger, you have disgraced our fallen soldiers as well by disobeying that code. Hicks said: 'When I look at [the] picture, I see a man who has served six years in our Navy, the mother of this child is prior Army' (above Samantha and Rodney in uniform) Hicks said her intention was to honor the U.S. flag while also honoring the family, as Clevenger's wife Samantha (pictured above with her father, a Navy member), also served for the country as a former US Army member, and he has served as a sailor in the US Navy for six years . 'I don't know what the military teaches these days but I do know my son was taught the flag code and also taught that any disobedience towards that code would result in repercussions from your command....yet here you are in uniform, name fully visible, on a photographer's Facebook page disobeying that code and dishonoring our fallen soldiers and you obviously don't care.' Several Facebook users supported the post agreeing that the 'code was broken and the flag was used as a prop', while others said 'anyone who is offended by this is uptight and ignorant'. One user wrote: 'I agree the code was broken and the flag was used as a prop. And desecrated by pee and poop from what I heard. 'I hold the flag sacred and it is my opinion is has 2 places. On a pole or on the casket of a fallen hero.' Hicks said she spent hours taking down comments from her business and company page criticizing the photo. Several Facebook users supported the post agreeing that the 'code was broken and the flag was used as a prop' (above a user slams Hicks's use of the flag in the photo shoot) On Facebook, she posted earlier this week writing that she almost let the negativity take her down, but then decided to take a stand and fight back. She wrote: 'Yesterday, I woke up to see this photo was shared on a group site that is meant to bash other photographers. It was in their opinion I had disrespected our nations flag. I had disrespected our country by taking this picture. 'Several of these people not only bashed the picture, but me, saying I should be ashamed of myself, my husband should be ashamed, etc and I received several private messages to my business page. 'They even took it a step farther and bashed the service member in the picture, hoping he gets in trouble for participating in desecration of the flag.' The photographer who is married to an active-duty Navy member announced that she has since offered the Clevenger family free photo shoots for life from her company as a way to thank them for their support (the Clevengers above) On Facebook, Hicks posted earlier this week writing that she almost let the negativity take her down, but then decided to take a stand and fight back. She has since received overwhelming support from those including military members who said the picture was not offensive (above a former solider shares appreciation for the photo) Hicks said that she believes the picture of Landon and Mr Clevenger shows what it means to be American (above a Navy member writes that those offended by the photograph are 'up tight and ignorant') Do you find this photo of a baby wrapped in an American flag by his sailor father disrespectful? Do you find this photo of a baby wrapped in an American flag by his sailor father disrespectful? Now share your opinion . Hicks added: 'I almost let these cyber bullies get me yesterday. I could have easily deleted the picture off of my business page and ended it with that. I almost did. Then I thought, why? 'These cyber bullies would win! Hell no! So I went to the group and I stood up to them. I stood up for what I believed in! And you know what, so did so many others!' Hicks said she has since received overwhelming support from those including military members who said the picture was not offensive. A user wrote in support of Hicks photo: 'It brought tears to my eyes. I am a former Soldier of the 82D Airborne Division, I cannot think of anything more perfect, to describe what fighting for your country truly means, than your picture. 'It is the embodiment of patriotism. I know the friends I have lost would think exactly the same thing. Thank you for your beautiful work.' Hicks said that she believes the picture of Landon and Mr Clevenger shows what it means to be American, according to WTKR. 'When I look at this picture, I see a man who has served six years in our Navy, the mother of this child is prior Army,' she said. The photographer who is married to an active-duty Navy member announced that she has since offered the Clevenger family free photo shoots for life from her company as a way to thank them for their support.

Stores are set to cut back on Black Friday discounts this year to avoid another ‘delivery tsunami’. The idea of Black Friday has been imported from America, where retailers offer big discounts to kick start the Christmas shopping season. However, it proved a disaster in Britain last year with long queues and violent scenes which saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year after a catastrophe in 2014 . At the same time, many online stores were simply unable to cope with the rush of orders with the result that a huge delivery backlog was created. Many retailers were also disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year. Significantly, it said: ‘Black Friday can be very profitable for retailers who get it right, but discount rates will need to be rationalised and panic-discounting avoided.’ It suggests stores might want to spread the discounts and promotion over a longer period, perhaps a weekend or week, in order to avoid the spike in orders. Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services. Scenes of violence: Cutomers fought tooth and nail to make the most of discount deals on black Friday. The scale of the event greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations . For many the scenes of chaos didn't pay off. Some retailers were disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business . The IMRG said: ‘The scale of Black Friday 2014 greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations, which meant a large number of online orders were compressed into a far shorter period of time than anticipated – triggering an online retail ‘delivery tsunami’. ‘This heavily impacted carrier and retailer fulfilment operations and normal activity suffered for days afterwards.’ Andrew Starkey, head of e-logistics at IMRG, said: ‘The huge surge in demand on Black Friday 2014 was unprecedented and caught everyone in the industry by surprise. Fevered and bullish behaviour in retail outlets saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security . ‘The exact form of it may evolve in 2015, but at least this time we have a precedent and time to develop strategies to ensure the Christmas peak runs as efficiently as possible. ‘It’s fair to say that Black Friday splits opinion, but the impact of it is so vast that it affects all retailers whether they run campaigns or not. ‘The key points for industry to address are around how to smooth out the spike – even spreading it over a few days would make a massive difference to fulfilment operations – and managing expectation so that customers receive accurate and up-to-date information about the progress of their orders.’ Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services, the IMRG said.	Shops cut back US retail event to avoid deliveries overload and confusion . Discounts supposed to kick-off Christmas proved disaster in the UK . Scenes of violence and disappointment marred Britain's Black Friday . Rush to order reduced merchandise online created huge delivery backlog . Expectations must be managed and crowds tamed for success this year .
(CNN)A Canadian tourist was killed after a small inflatable tour boat collided with a whale off the coast of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, authorities said Thursday. The victim was identified as Jennifer Karren, 35, according to the Baja California Sur Prosecutor General's Office. Karren is a Canadian from Calgary, Alberta, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Two other people aboard the Cabo Adventures' vessel were injured in the incident that happened Wednesday a quarter-mile from the Bay of Santa Maria, the Mexican Federal Attorney General's Office for the Protection of the Environment said. That federal agency is investigating the incident, it said. The inflatable boat, called the Cabo Adventure 9 and designed for recreational diving, was carrying nine people and was returning from a snorkel tour when a side of the craft collided with the whale, authorities said. The skipper, José Salazar Tendis, tried to avoid the whale, officials said. Salazar couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Karren fell in the water, and a tour guide and another passenger jumped in and brought her back on the boat, the federal agency said. The vessel captain immediately informed naval rescue officials, and the boat returned to shore as first aid and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation were performed on Karren, the federal agency said. A tourist aboard the watercraft who was also a nurse performed CPR, authorities said. The Canadian woman was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to the Baja California Sur Prosecutor General's Office. The tour company's general director, Felipe Diez-Canedo, released a statement through Mexican authorities that expressed regret that one of its guests died, despite receiving first aid and being transported to the hospital. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.	Jennifer Karren, 35, of Calgary, Alberta, falls overboard and later dies, authorities say .

A controversial documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, claims the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. On Monday makers of the film Going Clear: Scientology And The Prison Of Belief sat down for a panel discussion, where they addressed the alleged role the church played in the demise of the Hollywood couple's marriage. Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times, between author Lawrence Wright (who wrote the book the film is based on), filmmaker Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder. Scroll down for video... Revelations: A documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival alleges that the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman . In the film Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife. Monday's panel discussion focused in on Rathbun's claims. 'David Miscavige [leader of the Church of Scientology] was terrified that he was losing control of Tom Cruise, because Tom Cruise is the greatest rainmaker really, for Scientology,' Gibney claimed. Panel discussion: Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times , author Lawrence Wright, director Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder on Monday . At odds: Filmmakers say church leaders were fearful of Nicole's influence on Tom, pictured in Los Angeles in 1991 . The director went on to assert that Scientology and psychiatry are opposed, adding that the actress' father 'was a psychologist in Australia.' 'Miscavige was afraid that Nicole Kidman was slowly taking Tom away from the church,' Gibney continued. 'There was a concerted effort to get him back. One of the things they did was... at Tom's behest, Marty Rathbun testifies in the film, that David Miscavige requested Marty to go and tap Nicole Kidman's phone.' Cruise's attorney, however, told E! News regarding the claims of wiretapping: 'Tom Cruise did not hire any private investigator to spy on or investigate Nicole Kidman in any way. Nor did he ask the Church of Scientology to do that. Any statement to the contrary is provably false.' Gibney's film claims that Kidman, who was raised Catholic, convinced Cruise to distance himself from the Church of Scientology between 1992 and 2001. Over: The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church's Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004, pictured in 1999 . It also alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding. Rathbun suggests, in the film, this is when the aggressive campaign to tear the couple apart began. Urging them: Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Wright publicly pressed John Travolta and Cruise to speak out about claims of abuse within the church . Gibney went on to claim during Monday's panel: 'The other, more pernicious thing that happened was that they tried to turn their two kids against Nicole, which is really the most horrifying thing. 'They succeeded, so much so that we have people who told us that they began to refer to their mother privately as a suppressive person... and then they were told, "Now listen, the way you deal with suppressive people is, don't let on to them that you know that they're a suppressive person. So, be nice, smile, but be aware that this person is more dangerous and damaging than anything you could possibly believe."' Rinder, a former high ranking member of the church, went on to offer his own views on the claims: 'The circumstances surrounding that and his description of what happened, rings so true. 'The mind-set of Nicole isn't really with the program so here we go back to disconnection again, except it's got a nicer name, it doesn't exactly get presented that way to Tom Cruise.' 'It's "Tom, she's not good for you, you better straighten out here and get your life in order and we'll help you,"' he continued. 'That dictatorial control and efforts to control people's lives is really the ebb and flow of the Church of Scientology... There are all sorts of examples like that.' Back in 2012 Maureen Orth wrote a piece making similar claims about Kidman and Cruise's children being turned against the actress. At the time the church denied the claims made by the Vanity Fair piece. Cruise and Kidman share two adopted children together, Isabella, 22, and Conor, 20. Meanwhile, during Monday's panel Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Wright publicly pressed John Travolta and Cruise to speak out about claims of abuse within the church. 'The reason we are calling out Cruise and Travolta is they have the capacity, the power, to change it. There are only two ways that you can address the abuses that are going on in Scientology,' Wright said. Allegations: Marty Rathbun (left), formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims the head of the church David Miscavige (right) was suspicious of Cruise's second wife . Concerns: Kidman (pictured with Cruise in 2001) was listed as a 'Potential Trouble Source' because her father was a psychologist in Australia . 'One is to re-examine the tax exemption. But some of those celebrity megaphones, if they were turned around in the other direction they could make a difference. They should make a difference. I'd like to see Tom Cruise stand up and say it's time for David Miscavige to answer his accusers.' The Church Of Scientology responded belatedly to DailyMail.com's request for comment and denied all allegations made by the film and the filmmakers, including allegations of wiretapping, and claims made about David Miscavige. The church also characterized Marty Rathbun, Mike Rinder, and Alex Gibney as biased and unreliable sources. Before the controversial documentary's first screening, HBO hired 160 lawyers to look through the film. It is expected to air on the channel on March 29. In more than 200 tweets, the church has tried to discredit Gibney and his sources in Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. It has also issued a statement on the website of Freedom Magazine, its news publication, claiming the documentary is 'propaganda', 'one-sided', full of 'false information' and features 'vengeful' sources. Anger: The film alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's (pictured) phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding . Friends: Cruise, left, embraces David Miscavige, the Scienology Church's President of the Rulling Council during the official opening of a new Scientology church in central Madrid in 2004 . And a week before the premiere, it took out full-page ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times to offer a counter point of view. In addition, the church released a statement to Us Weekly, stating: 'This is not a film that is any way objective about Scientology. It is propaganda... Freedom of the press is not freedom to lie. The Church of Scientology has long fought against the kind of bigotry and religious hatred that Mr. Gibney and co-producer Lawrence Wright aim to incite. To fit their anti-religious agenda, they scraped the bottom of the barrel to cherry-pick a tiny collection of deadbeats.' Despite the furor surrounding the production, Gibney hopes it will lead to more investigations and reports into Scientology. He told Variety magazine: 'We hope that this film and Larry's book will start the process where more media will say well we don't care anymore. We're going to pursue this no matter what. According to the credits at the end of the film, Cruise and Kidman refused to be interviewed. The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church's Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004.

Rohit Sharma, aided by a contentious decision that gave him a second life, scored his first World Cup hundred on Thursday to help the defending world champions India post a daunting total of 302 for six in their quarter-final against Bangladesh. Rohit was caught in the deep when he was on 90 but was allowed to keep batting when the umpires ruled that Rubel Hossain's delivery was above waist-height and therefore a no-ball, although television replays suggested it was a fair delivery. Rohit had initially been forced to abandon his normal cavalier approach as his team mates struggled to score quickly on a windy afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground but exploded later in the innings. While Suresh Raina (65) was the only other batsman to make a significant contribution at a rapid strike-rate, Rohit batted for 47 overs to make 137 off 126 balls, highlighted by 14 boundaries and three sixes. For a man who scored a world record 264 last year, it was almost sluggish going by his normal standards but no less crucial in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the World Cup. Of the three matches already played at the sprawling MCG during this tournament, the team batting first has scored over 300 runs and won each time and Bangladesh now face a formidable challenge to break that sequence. The MCG can be an intimidating bear-pit of a stadium and India opted to bat first in front of their fanatical supporters, and got off to a flying start, racing past 50 inside the first 10 overs. Bangladesh, appearing in their first World Cup quarter-final, managed to put the brakes on India's scoring after the fielding restrictions were lifted and they brought on their spinners.

(CNN)Could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses? The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior this week shared a photo of a Weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in Erebus Bay, Antarctica. The expression of the mother is priceless. The photo was taken in October by USGS scientist William Link. Link, a statistician, was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups. He confirmed Friday that the adult seal was the baby's mom. It's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo, but Link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed, "so this Mom was pretty relaxed," Link told CNN Friday. "I have a great shot a few seconds later where Mom yawned hugely. She looked utterly content, to me." The agency's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media. As the Instagram caption notes, the Weddell seals of Erebus Bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years. "Because of its isolation, this population is undisturbed by human activities. The Weddell seal population is healthy and stable, and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics." Link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close. "I was awed," he said. "It's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions. It's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold, high winds, no life to be seen except for the seals, an occasional skua or an emperor penguin." After a seal pup is born, Link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area, with hardly any interaction with other seals. "Mom doesn't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned, and even then doesn't get to eat. So while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds, Mamma loses about twice that much," he said. For more information on the seals, visit WeddellSealScience.com.

A weekend report claiming that a top adviser to President Barack Obama leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State is 'baloney,' the White House said Monday. The New York Post on Saturday claimed that Valerie Jarrett, a close confidant of both the president and First Lady Michelle Obama, divulged details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. The bad press was reportedly timed to become public just as Clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated to reporters on Monday that the report wasn't true, though. Scroll down for video . A new report claims that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's (above) own party leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and likely presidential candidate was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State . Valerie Jarrett (left), one of President Barack Obama's (right) top advisers, reportedly leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House . The story ran in the New York Post and was written by Ed Klein, who spoke last Wednesday about his belief Jarrett was involved on Fox and Friends . ‘It's utter baloney,' he said after a reporter asked him about the rumor at his regular briefing with the press. He did not comment further on the matter. According to the New York Post article, authored by Edward Klein, a source close to the White House disclosed that 'Obama and Valerie Jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent Hillary from becoming president.' 'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the Democrat Party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the Clintons, who she believed had begun 'marginalizing the president' and were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' She reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high-profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, the president and the first lady, reportedly sat down with Clinton and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett is reported to have been speaking to Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She’s promised O’Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' a source who spoke to Klein allegedly said. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016 . She has also reportedly reached out to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary . Klein, the author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also says he spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' And it's not over yet, as according to Klein, six additional probes into Clinton's performance are underway. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, having discussed it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' Klein claimed. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama’s longest serving advisers. She said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'

Tottenham Hotspur have been given the go-ahead to build their new stadium after a local firm admitted defeat in its objections to the £400 million development. Archway Sheet Metal Works launched a legal challenge to a compulsory purchase order (CPO) rejected last month but could have appealed. The firm has now decided not to do so, it announced on Friday. How Tottenham's new stadium will look for night games from 2018-19 season onwards . Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham needed for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful . Now that Archway have dropped their case, Spurs have the go-ahead for their new 56,000-plus capacity stadium at White Hart Lane . The company announced in a statement: 'We have always been willing to negotiate with the club on a reasonable and proper basis. 'We will continue to try to achieve a proper settlement by agreement if that is possible.' Spurs have relocated more than 70 local businesses from the site, which is adjacent to the White Hart Lane home they have occupied since 1899. By moving for what is expected to be the 2018-19 season, they will increase their capacity from barely 36,000 to 56,250. Before then Tottenham expect to move elsewhere for at least one season, possibly alternating between Wembley and sharing with League One (third tier) club Milton Keynes Dons. The club also applied several years ago to move permanently to the Olympic Stadium but lost out to London rivals West Ham United.

(CNN)When Selena was breaking concert attendance records at home and abroad, there weren't a lot of crossover pop stars who looked like her in the United States. There was Rita Moreno and Gloria Estefan and ... well, that's about it. The March 31, 1995, death of the Mexican-American singer plunged many Latino listeners into mourning and brought her music to the attention of English speakers who would soon become fans. Selena Quintanilla-Perez started singing the Tejano music that eventually made her famous in her father's restaurant in Lake Jackson, Texas. Her father Abraham taught the family band and named them Los Dinos after his own group from earlier years. Selena's brother, A.B., played bass, and her sister, Suzette, played drums. When the family moved to Corpus Christi, the group started getting gigs at local parties and weddings. Selena was only 15 when she won female entertainer of the year at the Tejano Music Awards. That got her a record contract, and several albums followed. She eventually married her guitarist, Chris Perez. In 1994, she won a Grammy for best Mexican-American album for "Selena Live!" and seemed poised for mainstream stardom. When the president of Selena's fan club shot her to death the following year in a Texas motel room, her first English-language album was months from release. Her death made international headlines. She was 23 years old. Twenty years later, her influence is still being felt. Her official Facebook page still has more than 2 million likes, and fans are remembering the singer who crossed barriers and made them sing and dance to her blend of Tejano music. Fans will celebrate her life and legacy at the commemorative Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi in mid-April. Here are five things you may not know about Selena. Selena had to learn Spanish. A third-generation Texan of Mexican descent, Selena didn't grow up speaking Spanish. Neither did her husband, Perez, who played guitar in her band and fell in love with her on the road. In his book, "To Selena, with Love," Perez said they practiced speaking Spanish before their first big publicity blitz in Mexico. "In Mexico, Selena mangled her conversations in Spanish like the rest of us, but not for long." "She said, 'It'll be cool. You watch. I'm going to learn Spanish and surprise everybody,' " Perez wrote. "She got better and better, to the point where I'd have to ask her to slow down so that I could understand what she was saying." She sold out the Astrodome. Selena performed several times at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo at the Astrodome to sold-out crowds of more than 60,000 people. (It wasn't just any rodeo: Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the Osmonds have all played the event.) "We had 20 performances this year," Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show, told the New York Times in 1995. "We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome." Her album went to No. 1. Her 1995 crossover album, "Dreaming of You," went to the top of the Billboard 200 the first week it was released. She was the first Latin artist to debut atop the list. "There were supposed to be 14 tracks, but we had only recorded four of them, so we put together a tribute album of new and old songs," Nancy Brennan, then vice president of A&R at EMI, told Texas Monthly. "Making that album was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do, because we were listening to her voice all day and crying as we were mixing the songs." "Selena" (the movie) ignited Jennifer Lopez's career. Starring as Selena in the 1997 movie of the same name, Jennifer Lopez became the first Latina actress to be paid $1 million for a movie role. Lopez was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. "Getting to play the part of Selena was life-changing for me," Lopez told Para Todos magazine. "I got to immerse myself in her life, got to know her family, her home, her culture ... every part of her story. It was a special time in my life both professionally and personally. Playing her not only opened doors for me in the film world, but it inspired me to start my own music career. In a lot of ways, I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't had that experience." Selena's killer is eligible for parole in 2025. Yolanda Saldivar, the president of Selena's fan club, was sentenced to life in prison in October 1995 for Selena's murder. Saldivar must serve at least 30 years of her sentence before she is eligible for parole. Selena was meeting with Saldivar at a Corpus Christi motel to discuss her concerns that Saldivar had embezzled money from her when Saldivar shot her, according to trial testimony. Saldivar argued that she accidentally fired the shot, but the jury didn't buy it. CNN's Victoria Moll-Ramirez contributed to this story.	Selena's music attracted Latino fans in the U.S. and Spanish-speaking fans abroad . She had to learn Spanish to conduct interviews in Spanish-speaking countries . Her English-language album went to No. 1 on Billboard's Top 200 chart after she died .
The devastated parents of a New Zealand man, jailed for making a joke about Buddha, have revealed the horrific conditions their son is suffering through in a Myanmar prison. Wellington-based Brian and Angela Blackwood have launch an online petition to campaign for Philip Backwood's freedom, insisting that their son and his colleagues have been unjustly convicted. They have revealed their pain they feel as they can not help their son, who is being subjected to the brutal conditions inside Yangon's notorious Insein Prison. He has been sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. He has been held in the jail since his arrest in December. 'He sleeps on a wooden pallet, no bedding is allowed, no mattress, no pillow,' Brian told ABC. He is only allowed to see his fiancé Noemi Alamo and their seven-month-old daughter for an hour every fortnight. Scroll down for video . Philip Blackwood (C) is escorted by police to a court hearing in Yangon. Blackwood and his two Myanmar colleagues were sentenced  to two and a half years in jail for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks . Two weeks ago the bar manager and his two Myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a Yangon court for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night. However, Blackwood's hard labour penalty has been lifted as he is a foreigner. The ad posted on Facebook in December caused a stir of outrage in the former junta-ruled country, where surging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern. Philip Blackwood, who worked at the VGastro bar in Yangon, was found guilty of insulting religion, after the New Zealander posted a mocked-up photo of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook — in reference to a well-known international club brand. The three convicted men have the support of a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The group have condemned the court's ruling and called for the unconditional release of Mr. Blackwood and his colleagues. 'It is ludicrous that these three men have been jailed simply for posting an image online to promote a bar,' a spokesperson for Amnesty International in South East Asia and the Pacific said. “They should be immediately and unconditionally released.” According to International commission of Jurists in the Asia and Pacific, the conviction violates Mynamar's own legal standards. 'The conviction violates international standards for imprisoning people for speech (and) seems to violate Myanmar’s own legal standards which require intent.' Blackwood's loved ones are fighting to help alleviate some of Blackwood's struggles during his sentence. 'He has a hole in the ground for a toilet and he has a bucket of water that he washes in, keeps himself tidy with. 'He is only given broth and rice to eat. 'I don't believe that we understand half of what he is suffering.' Mr Blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison. He was found guilty of insulting Buddhism . Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested  after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page . Blackwood's parents worry for their son's physical and mental health, as he tries to withstand the heat and poor hygiene. They are particularly concerned as their son suffers from a chest condition and from asthma. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police in December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. The harsh conviction comes despite Mr and Mrs Blackwood's insistence that 'The judge's ruling that the three had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' was not founded on any concrete evidence at all. 'Mr. Blackwood did not have legal representation when he was charged, nor did he have any interpreter to explain what was going on,' the petition reads. 'Three months later, they were found guilty, despite prosecution not having established intent on the side of the three accused.' A Buddhist monk tries to take a photo of New Zealander Philip Blackwood as he gets into a police vehicle outside the court . VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . In emotional scenes after the verdict, family members of the two Myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing, with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside. The case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the Buddhist-majority country, which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011, is seeing its much-lauded reforms stalling. The trio were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image. Judge Ye Lwin said that while Blackwood, 32, had posted an apology, he had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' when he uploaded the photo. He added that although the New Zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend, it was also 'unreasonable only to blame the foreigner' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the Myanmar defendants. Htut Ko Ko Lwin's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing. The wife of bar owner Tun Thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing. 'They just decided everybody is guilty so I'm very shocked. This is very unfair,' Myat Nandar said. Blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras. Myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years, mainly targeting the Muslim minority. The bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks, who have advocated controversial new laws. Rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women. V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks before the incident, swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday's sentences showed 'freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever' in Myanmar, which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year. 'The authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men, vacate the conviction, and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally,' he said in a statement. Blackwood's parents told Fairfax Media from their New Zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal. 'We hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act...' said father Brian Blackwood.

A woman came home from her local markets with more than she bargained for after unexpectedly giving birth on the grass amidst dozens of busy stalls. Kashelle Knox, 28, hadn't been expecting her second child to arrive for another ten days but the Brisbane mother from Fairfield told Daily Mail Australia that she knew it was time while waiting in a queue for food at the Boundary Street Markets. 'After a few contractions I was like, this baby is coming now whether I like it or not,' Mrs Knox said. Pictured in an ambulance after giving birth, Kashelle Knox unexpectedly went into labour while out for some dinner at the Boundary Street Markets . She gave birth to a baby boy, almost two weeks before her due date, as 3,500 market attendees looked on . Market manager David Bostock said he was informed by paramedics that a woman was delivering a baby beside the Wurst-Meister market stalls and a café (pictured) 'I called my midwife and got my friend to call my husband to come and pick me up. We knew this one was going to be faster than my first [child birth], but not that fast.' Mrs Knox gave birth within half an hour. By the time paramedics made it to the scene, the baby's head had already appeared and by the time her husband made his way over, his wife was presenting him with their newborn son. Market manager David Bostock told Daily Mail Australia that there were over 3,500 people at the market with 'music was playing in the background' when Mrs Knox gave birth. 'I was closing a stall up when an ambulance drove up the driveway and I rushed out thinking someone was in trouble. The paramedic said someone was delivering a baby beside the Wurst-Meister shop and the café,' Mr Bostock said. Mrs Knox's waters broke just after a friend arrived to take her home: 'That's when my midwife recommended I move to a quiet corner and so I moved five metres away and had the baby,' she said . Mrs Knox gave birth within half an hour. By the time paramedics made it to the scene, the baby's head had already appeared and by the time her husband made his way over, his wife was presenting him with their son . Her husband, Andrew (pictured with his newborn son), struggled to find someone to take care of the couple's first child so he could rush to his wife's side . 'People took their shirts off and were handing her towels and now they're all hanging on the market fence on coat hangers all ironed and pressed with beautifully written thank you notes saying 'thank you very much for helping and supporting the birth of our baby'. Mrs Knox admitted that while shy at first, and desperate for her husband to be there for the birth, she was forced to accept the circumstances. 'I told my friend I was feeling a bit funny, I was a bit nauseous, and as we were lining up for food I got more nauseous and said "I'm just going to sit here" and I was thinking I just needed to vomit,' she said. 'So I said "I'm just going to lie over there and vomit". I thought it was hunger nausea, but then I started having contractions. 'I was a bit hesitant to relax into the contractions because I knew Andrew (right) wouldn't make it., but after a few contractions I was like, this baby is coming now whether I like it or not,' Mrs Knox (left) said . Mrs Konx's two children, 22 month old Tarquin and her little brother, cuddle up on the couch . 'I was a bit hesitant to relax into the contractions because I knew Andrew wouldn't make it. 'He couldn't find someone to look after our other child who was at home and had just been put to bed, so he was calling a friend to pick me up and bring me home, but by the time she had got there my waters had broken. 'That's when my midwife recommended I move to a quiet corner and so I moved five metres away and had the baby. 'Where I was, it was quite secluded even though it was next to the footpath, and I still had my clothes on at that point. The proud parents are still yet to decide on a name for their newborn, who was born almost two weeks ago . 'It's tough now because it's such a unique situation you want the name to be receptive of how unique the birth was,' Mrs Knox admitted . 'I had to ask the friend I was with to find shirts because I knew he was coming - and then I took my shirt off and squatted over that so I could have him on that rather than the grass and dirt. 'We collected about six items of clothing that we went home with as well as ambulance blankets.' The proud parents are still yet to decide on a name for their newborn, who was born almost two weeks ago. 'It's tough now because it's such a unique situation you want the name to be receptive of how unique the birth was,' Mrs Knox admitted. The experience was documented by Mr Knox's mother, Ngaire Naran, and can be viewed on her blog.	Kashelle Knox was queuing up for food when she started to feel nauseous . In half an hour the 28 year old gave birth among a 3,500-strong crowd . Market-goers donated their shirts to the mother of two .

Rush-hour commuters were left screaming and in tears today when a passenger fell under a London Underground train  - apparently after her coat became stuck in the doors. Firefighters, police and paramedics raced to Clapham South station in south London just after 8am when the 28-year-old woman fell from travellers described as an ‘overcrowded’ platform. She was taken to St George's Hospital with ‘non-life-threatening injuries’, but the incident led to huge queues for buses as Northern line services between Kennington and Morden were paralysed. Queues: Firefighters, police and paramedics raced to Clapham South station in south London just after 8am . Incident: The 28-year-old woman suffered 'non life-threatening' injuries after falling from the platform and under a London Underground train at Clapham South. Pictured: The platform minutes after the woman fell . Very busy: Overcrowding at Brixton station in south London today following the accident at Clapham South . Witnesses told of fire crews hoisting up a Tube train to free the woman on the northbound platform, and claimed the woman was pulled underneath the train as it approached. One 13-year-old girl, who watched the incident unfold, said on Twitter: 'Her coat got stuck in the Tube doors, she was dragged across the platform. I saw it all. Thank God she survived.' NHS worker Jack Smith, 25, told the London Evening Standard: ‘I heard this prolonged scream from 20m (65ft) down the platform. There were loads of women around her screaming and pointing.' James Callen, a corporate services executive, added: ‘As the Tube pulled in people inevitably shuffled forward and the woman was pushed under the tube. 'There were horrendous screams coming from her and the people who were standing around her. We were ushered out pretty quickly and it was complete chaos. A lot of people were crying as well.’ Cristina Squires, Channel 5 News editor, said on Twitter that she saw firemen trying to rescue the woman, and claimed they had to 'jack up the train'. Emergency services on the scene: One witness told of how fire crews hoisting up a Tube train to free the woman, while another said the woman was pulled underneath the train as it approached . Waiting: Queues outside Balham station. Transport for London denied the incident was due to overcrowding . Sarah-Jane Peyton, a BBC EastEnders publicist, tweeted: 'Just been evacuated from a Tube at Clapham South after a poor woman was dragged underneath it. Horrible. Totally shaken up.' Transport for London denied the incident was due to overcrowding. But one commuter, who travels to west London daily from the station, said this issue is a major problem at Clapham South. He told MailOnline: ‘People are usually queuing back about ten people deep on the platform itself, and every train that arrives at the station is packed, so you have to squash on. ‘If you’re trying to board around 8.15am you’ll likely have to wait for five to ten trains in order to actually get on one, as barely one person can squeeze on at a time. ‘Sometimes the station gets so packed that they close access, because the platforms are so packed, and people have to queue outside until it is opened again.’ Ambulances and fire engines: One commuter, who travels to west London daily from the station, said overcrowding was a major problem at Clapham South . Totally shaken up': Sarah-Jane Peyton, a BBC EastEnders publicist, said the incident today was 'horrible' He added: ‘People push right up to the yellow line on the platform, so I’ve always thought there is a danger of falling onto the tracks if someone is just pushed slightly.' Software designer Ben Oakenfull said on Twitter: 'Someone under a train at Clapham South. Not a surprise really as the platform gets so overcrowded. Time for TfL to look at safety.' Nigel Holness, London Underground’s operations director, said: ‘Just before 8am this morning a passenger fell between the train and tracks at Clapham South station. ‘The passenger has been recovered by the emergency services with non-life-threatening injuries. There was no service from Morden to Kennington for around an hour, while the rest of the line had minor delays. The service has now resumed.’ He went on: 'The safety of customers and staff is our top priority and we do all we can to ensure customers can travel safely at all times. Thankfully incidents of this nature are extremely rare on our network and the Tube is one of the safest railways in the world. 'This follows heavy investment in safety improvements, and we are constantly seeking to further improve our excellent safety record.' British Transport Police said the incident was 'not being treated as suspicious' and an investigation had been launched. The London Fire Brigade said it sent two fire engines and a fire rescue unit, and helped recover the woman from the tracks. A spokesman said: 'Firefighters used a "scoop stretcher" - a specialist piece of equipment - to bring her back to the platform before she was taken to hospital.' An London Ambulance Service crew and air ambulance were also sent to the station, where the woman was treated before being taken to the hospital in Tooting. Her condition was not available.

In Mr Johnstone's vegan-themed book, titled Carb The F*** Up: Follow Your Heart With No F**** Given, he claims he makes $10,000 a month from his various YouTube channels. 'Yep, easy money isn't it just for doing videos on health, sharks, bike stuff and pimping out my girlfriend... hey, sex sells and so does the fear of sharks,' he wrote. 'We troll the internet with the health message and use whatever means possible to get that message out there ... swearing, sharks or cleavage usually works pretty good. 'I'm 37, zero debt, enough money in the bank to retire in about 100 different countries for the rest of my life... thanks, YouTube!' His book also goes on to say Mr Johnstone isn't there to make friends, he 'doesn't care' who he offends in his online posts and he welcomes trolls. 'The only reason I delete or block someone is so they get fired up and talk about us on someone else's video,' he wrote. 'That way, they advertise us — and for free.'

(CNN)Former Vice President Walter Mondale was released from the Mayo Clinic on Saturday after being admitted with influenza, hospital spokeswoman Kelley Luckstein said. "He's doing well. We treated him for flu and cold symptoms and he was released today," she said. Mondale, 87, was diagnosed after he went to the hospital for a routine checkup following a fever, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday. "He is in the bed right this moment, but looking forward to come back home," Carter said during a speech at a Nobel Peace Prize Forum in Minneapolis. "He said tell everybody he is doing well." Mondale underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The 42nd vice president served under Carter between 1977 and 1981, and later ran for President, but lost to Ronald Reagan. But not before he made history by naming a woman, U.S. Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro of New York, as his running mate. Before that, the former lawyer was  a U.S. senator from Minnesota. His wife, Joan Mondale, died last year.	Walter Mondale was released from the Mayo Clinic on Saturday, hospital spokeswoman said .

Ed Miliband was branded the SNP's poodle yesterday – as Alex Salmond boasted he would install the Labour leader in No10. In a second pink champagne-fuelled interview in consecutive days, the former SNP leader pledged to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' if the election produces a hung parliament. Mr Salmond said the SNP would back Labour regardless of any formal deal, but said his party would make 'progressive amendments' to the Budget and other legislation – code for higher taxes and Left-wing policies. The Prime Minister seized on the comments in the Commons, describing Mr Miliband as 'Alex Salmond's poodle'. Scroll down for video . Controversial: In a 'champagne-fuelled interview', former SNP leader Alex Salmond (pictured) pledged to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' if the election produces a hung parliament . Lap dog: Prime Minister David Cameron seized on the comments in the Commons, describing Labour Leader Ed Miliband (pictured) as 'Alex Salmond's poodle' 'As far as I can see, Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note,' he said. 'And the ransom note is very clear. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence. 'That's what is being demanded and the British people have only one way of saying no to this appalling hostage situation – and that is to vote Conservative on May 7.' Mr Salmond's latest intervention also appeared to irritate the SNP's new leader Nicola Sturgeon. As her predecessor stole her limelight again, Scotland's First Minister attempted to stamp her authority on the party, insisting: 'I'm the leader of the SNP.' In an interview with the Spectator magazine – during which he guzzled pink champagne for a second consecutive day – Mr Salmond said his MPs would vote to kick out the Tories whether they secure concessions from Labour or not. 'The SNP approach to a Cameron minority government will be to bring it down,' he said. In an interview with the New Statesman the previous day, Mr Salmond again ordered a bottle of pink champagne, ostensibly to celebrate the publication of his book on last year's referendum campaign. On the offensive: Mr Cameron said: 'As far as I can see, Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note' Not amused: Mr Salmond's latest interview also appeared to irritate the SNP's new leader Nicola Sturgeon (left), who declared 'I'm the leader of the SNP' in a bid to reassert her authority . Mr Salmond, who also revealed that he 'identifies' with Nelson Mandela, said the SNP would join forces with Labour to vote down any Queen's Speech put forward by a minority Conservative government. The SNP is riding high in the polls and experts predict the party could win as many as 50 of Scotland's 59 seats, making it potentially the third biggest party at Westminster. Labour will 'redistribute' hundreds of millions of pounds from England to Scotland if it wins the election, the party's leader north of the border boasted yesterday. Jim Murphy pledged in a speech in the City of London to use money raided from the pensions of better-off workers in England to pay for a 'jobs guarantee' for young people in Scotland, and higher bursaries for Scottish students. Mr Murphy has already angered voters in England by boasting that he will use the proceeds of a mansion tax in the South East to pay for an extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland. A Scottish Labour source said that, unlike the SNP, it could promise to raise taxes in England and spend them in Scotland. 'This announcement means two of Scottish Labour's first three election pledges will be funded by money raised from the more prosperous parts of the UK.' Mr Salmond, who is expected to return to Westminster as an MP in May in the hope of being kingmaker, said the party that holds the balance of power 'holds the power'. The Conservatives are set to make the threat of a Labour/SNP government a major campaign issue in England. The party has already mocked up a poster showing a tiny Mr Miliband in Mr Salmond's pocket. And sources point out that the SNP has previously set out a string of ruinously high demands, including £180billion of extra borrowing, ditching Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent, increased immigration and billions more in benefits. Labour yesterday seized on Mr Salmond's admission that the SNP will back the party in government even if it cannot get a formal deal. Tom Harris, MP for Glasgow South, said Mr Salmond has 'dispensed with his last bargaining point'. 'They have nothing to offer us and they have no threats to make that are remotely realistic.' Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy described Mr Salmond as 'David Cameron's little helper'. In an interview with LBC radio, he conceded that the opinion polls are 'bloody awful for Labour'. A YouGov poll revealed that Miss Sturgeon is the most popular party leader. It gave her an approval rating of plus five. Mr Cameron was minus five, Mr Miliband minus 39 and Nick Clegg minus 47.

While trust, a similar sense of humour and honesty are judged the three most important factors in a relationship, a few other elements are essential for long-lasting love. According to a new survey in which British couples were asked to spill the beans on what they feel are the secrets to a happy marriage, having two cars, his and hers toilets and televisions all got the vote. Interestingly having regular sex only came in 20th on the list of 50 marriage tips, from a poll of 2,000 couples to mark the launch of a new book, How to Seduce Your Wife (or Anyone Else's). Why fight over programmes you both don't want to watch? Happy couples say they just get two separate televisions . Two bathrooms and toilets are another key to a happy relationship, according to a poll of 2,000 people . Getting on with each other's friends and family, having no ex-partners on your Facebook friends list and separate bank accounts also feature in the top 50 secrets. Blissful couples also say trust, remembering birthdays and anniversaries and saying 'I love you' regularly help keep a relationship happy and harmonious. The book's author Andy Gibney said: 'Trust, compromise and honesty are generally regarded as the most important things in a marriage but for most people, it's not that simple. 'In the modern world, marriages are having to survive against a host of new technology with many couple falling out over what to watch on the TV or one or both of you spending too much time focusing on your computers, tablets or mobile phones. 'Romance is also an important factor, whether this is a surprise gift, a date night or simply some quality time together. 'After being married for a while, it's easy to find you are stuck in a rut and not really paying each other any attention, but hopefully some of these 'secrets' will be helpful.' Trust, honesty and a shared sense of humour are the top three elements in a happy marriage, a survey finds . Always being honest with each other and remembering each other's birthdays and important anniversaries come in as third and fourth most important ingredients to lasting love and accepting each other's faults comes fifth. Compromising, saying 'I love you' regularly, knowing when to say sorry, being able to laugh at each other and having a similar outlook on life complete the top ten. Blissful couples also recommend regular hugs and cuddles, always kissing each other goodnight and in the mornings before leaving the house and surprising your other half with the occasional romantic gesture. His 'n' hers motors is the 35th most important ingredient to marital happiness, according to the poll . Considering your partner to be your best friend, sharing parenting duties equally and having at least some shared hobbies or interests also feature high on the list. Talking about a problem instead of bottling it up, asking how your partner's day has gone and having regular sex completed the top 20. But in order to cut down on the disagreements, the secrets to a happy marriage also include no hogging the remote, having two TVs in the house to avoid any clashes over what to watch and each person having their own car. Being happy to share your phone code or social media passwords with your partner also leads to a happy marriage. The top 50 also includes never going to sleep on an argument and surprise gifts. It also emerged that three quarters of people think you are more likely to have a happy and successful marriage if you are friends before becoming an item, while 95 per cent consider romance to be important. But less than one in ten want the traditional flowers and chocolates, with 29 per cent just wanting a little surprise from their partner every now and then. Another 21 per cent see gifts as a romantic gesture if it's something personal to them, while one in four just enjoy the small gestures such as holding hands in public. Mr Gibney added: 'It should be obvious that it is communication that keeps people together, whether that's verbal or non-verbal, but life has a way of getting in the way. 'The research, and the message in the book, is keep talking, keep laughing, keep doing the things that made you happy at the start of your relationship and never lose it. 'Keep the respect, keep the kissing and the intimacy and, above all, remember why you fell in love in the first place.' 1. Trusting each other . 2. Same sense of humour . 3.

Researchers have mapped dark matter in several colliding galaxy clusters more than a billion light-years away. And one outcome of the research is that dark matter might not actually be composed of particles, as previously thought. Instead, a number of theories ranging from it being a fluid, to not existing at all, have been presented by researchers - who also say it is likely 'weirder than we first thought.' Researchers in Switzerland and the UK mapped dark matter in clusters (shown in blue), and discovered that dark matter might be 'weirder than we thought'. Clockwise from top left, the galaxy clusters are: MACS J0416.1+2403, MACS J0152.5+2852, MACS J0717.5+3745, ZwCl 1358+62, Abell 2744 and Abell 370 . The research was carried out by scientists from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, the University of Edinburgh and Durham University. They used data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory to measure galaxy clusters - collections of hundreds of galaxies. Surprisingly, the study discovered that dark matter ‘particles’ may simply pass through each other when galaxy clusters collide. ‘This work looks at the way dark matter interacts with itself when massive clouds of it are smashed together with other massive clouds,’ lead author Dr David Harvey from EFPL told MailOnline. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. ‘We find that when this happens, the dark matter does not get affected at all and it carries on unimpeded.’ This implies that dark matter particles do not interact with themselves, which would have caused dark matter to slow down. Instead, it appears that while dark matter could interact ‘non-gravitationally’ with visible matter, this is not the case when it interacts with itself. More importantly, the study challenges the view that dark matter consists of proton-like particles - or perhaps any particles whatsoever. ‘The implications for dark matter are that it rules out some models of particle dark matter, for example it challenges the idea that dark matter is made of an equivalent 'dark proton' that is exchanging 'dark photons’,’ said Dr Harvey. ‘To say we can conclude that dark matter is not a particle is too far, but we are challenging many models of dark matter, and it remains to be seen whether dark matter is a particle as many lines of research are yet to prove this.’ Using the Hubble Space Telescope (shown from Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2009), the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light-years away. They were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter, and make maps of where it should be . Harvey's data came from the Chandra X-ray Space Observatory and the Hubble telescope, and included the famous Bullet Cluster collision (shown), a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet. This particular collision is the best current evidence for the existence of dark matter . Dr Richard Massey, one of the authors on the study, told MailOnline that it was most likely a different type of particle to what scientists had been looking for so far. ‘But there are those very weird theories that also might be able to replace this,’ he said. One theory is that perhaps the theory of gravity, first proposed by Einstein, is wrong - and dark matter doesn’t actually exist at all. All of our evidence for dark matter so far comes from its supposed gravitational effect on galaxies - but if our models of gravity are wrong, then this could be false evidence. ‘Alternatively, dark matter could be some kind of fluid, rather than a particle with a property in space,’ Dr Massey said. Another theory is that dark matter is made out of ‘glue balls’, which are a conglomeration of smaller particles ‘glued’ together in an ensemble. The researchers created the maps by studying the effects dark matter had on extremely distant galaxies. While dark matter can’t be seen directly, it’s presence can be predicted based on these interactions. ‘We can’t observe wind, but you know it’s there because leaves are floating around,’ said co-author Dr Richard Massey from Durham University's Institute for Computational Cosmology. ‘Dark matter is similar, we can’t see it, but it pulls things around a bit.’ Using the Hubble Space Telescope, the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light-years away. They were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter, and make maps of where it should be. But the fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or, perhaps, even other matter - in ways we would think. ‘If you hit your head against a wall of dark matter, your head would go straight through,’ explained Dr Massey. ‘This makes it very difficult stuff to work with.’ ‘Dark matter is all around our own galaxy, all around Earth, and is passing through us right now, but it doesn’t have an effect on us.’ He added that it was ‘embarrassing’ that we knew so little about dark matter, despite seeming to be a ‘parallel universe’ that was far more important than our own. And from their study, the researchers conclude that dark matter is even ‘weirder than we first thought.’ The scientists also used data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (illustration shown) to measure dark matter in the distant galaxies. But it is very difficult to find. ‘If you hit your head against a wall of dark matter, your head would go straight through,’ explained co-author Dr Massey . The fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or, perhaps, even other matter - in ways we would think possible. Shown is the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1+2403 and its dark matter distribution, shown in blue, based on its gravitational interactions . Although it accounts for 90 per cent of all matter in the universe and more than a quarter of its energy, scientists still know very little about dark matter. After a two-year shutdown and upgrade, the multi-billion dollar Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is about to ramp up for its second three-year run. Scientists are promising nearly twice the energy and far more violent particle crashes this time around - and hope to get a glimpse of dark matter. The team at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, or Cern, say if nature cooperates, the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe. Beams should start running through the giant machine later this month, with the first high energy crashes probably coming in May, accelerator director Frederick Bordry said in a news conference in Geneva. Scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics, including a first ever glimpse of dark matter, one of the chief focuses of the experiment. 'I want to see the first light in the dark universe,' said Cern General Director Rolf Heuer. 'If I see that, then nature is kind to me.' One major idea among astronomers is that dark matter consists of a new subatomic particle that we haven't discovered yet. More exotic theories want dark matter to be a quantum defect from the birth of the universe, extra-dimensional mass, or even a modified form of gravity. What we do know is that dark matter interacts with cosmic structures through gravity, shaping and molding them. For example, dark matter bends light that passes through it, distorting images of distant space objects. In addition, dark matter speeds up the motion of galaxies inside galaxy clusters, which are collections of hundreds of galaxies, containing literally astronomical amounts of stars, planets, and gases. Galaxy clusters are also 90 per cent dark matter, which makes them ideal for studying it, especially when they collide into each other and force their respective dark matters to interact. Based on this knowledge, Dr Harvey and his colleagues studied data from 72 galaxy cluster collisions. These cosmic crashes happen over the course of billions of years when galaxy clusters attract each other because of their gargantuan masses. When this happens, the dark matter in each galaxy cluster interacts with that of the other, offering a unique opportunity to study it. The team's data came from the Chandra X-ray Space Observatory and the Hubble telescope, and included the famous Bullet Cluster collision, a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet. And so far, this particular collision is the best evidence for the existence of dark matter, based on its interaction with the clusters. In the coming years, scientists will be hoping to directly observe dark matter particles in a number of detectors - including the LHC at Cern. What form it will take, though, or whether it is really there, remains to be seen.	Researchers in Switzerland and the UK mapped dark matter in clusters . They discovered that dark matter 'particles' pass through themselves . This suggests dark matter may not actually be composed of particles . It could instead be like a 'fluid', or something else entirely . 'We are challenging many models of dark matter,' lead author Dr Harvey told MailOnline .
Handing out fatherly advice, putting a reassuring arm around a shoulder and helping youngsters with their school work - it is not your average video clip of Wayne Rooney. The Manchester United and England star, however, showed there is more to him than scoring goals and hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons on a visit to Stretford High School. The 29-year-old joined team-mate Paddy McNair to surprise youngsters, walking in unannounced while they were in the middle of a class. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney attended Stretford High School to help out last month . And in a clip posted by the club's charity arm, the Manchester United Foundation, the dad-of-two reveals his fatherly traits. The youngsters were told to make a football team from a variety of animals. And Rooney went for a selection that manager Louis van Gaal may wish to ponder when he goes shopping for new defender this summer, putting a meerkat at centre-half 'because he's quicker so he can cover the hippo and the hedgehog'.

The illustrious artist, CJ Hendry has made a prominent name for herself when she sold one of her pieces to Kanye West, but she has just completed a brand new venture - and it's delicious. The 27-year-old from Brisbane has pushed her artistic limit by locked herself in a room for 50 consecutive days to produce an artwork every 24 hours and publishing them to her social media accounts as proof. The hyper realistic images are part of her Melbourne-based exhibition '50 foods in 50 days,' which was coined after CJ read accounts from inmates who were on death row.

CJ uses felt tip pens and a sketching style that incorporates scribbling tiny circles to get the desired effect . She was inspired to create 50 meals on stunning Hermes plates, to juxtapose the luxurious platters with basic food items, believing that if she were ever to be served a final meal, she would want it one of these plates.

The team with the lowest transfer outlay this season rose unassumingly into eighth place on Wednesday night. Stoke City beat Everton, to nobody’s great surprise, and look on course for their best Premier League finish yet – a year after their last. Mark Hughes really should be in the running for those annual accolades saluting success amid all this. Manager of the Year? Quite possibly. Mark Hughes looks on with a smile as his Stoke City side cruise to a 2-0 win over Everton on Wednesday . He has signed with remarkable shrewdness, shaped his players into a cohesive style, and overcome the set-backs of regular injuries to key players to guide Stoke to 42 points after 28 games. His team registered 50 Premier League points in reaching ninth last term, two club records, but are currently in a rich vein of form and likely to go higher. Seven wins from 11 in the league have seen Stoke nudge past West Ham United and Swansea – both clubs with claims to good seasons. And all the while forking out less cash on recruits than Burnley. That is the bit to amaze. Hughes has committed £1.2million on bringing in new players this season: £800,000 on brilliant Bojan from Barcelona, and £400,000 on young centre-back Dionatan Teixeira from Slovakian side Dukla Banska Bystrica. Mame Biram Diouf, scorer against Everton to take his tally to seven Premier League goals? Free from Hannover. Jon Walters (centre) congratulates Mame Biram Diouf after he scored Stoke's second goal on Wednesday . Phil Bardsley, a regular at right-back with 22 Premier League games? Free from Sunderland. Steve Sidwell, who has been adept when called upon, also cost nothing after leaving Fulham. Victor Moses, whose uncommonly good header broke the deadlock at the Britannia on Wednesday, is on loan from Chelsea. Philipp Wollscheid, who has come into defence at a vital period to instant effect, is on loan from Bayer Leverkusen with view to permanent move this summer. By contrast Burnley, hardly the most lavish of spenders, have parted with around £8m on transfer fees. Michael Kightly was one of Sean Dyche’s purchases, at £1.5m, from Stoke. Stoke also sold Cameron Jerome to Norwich and Ryan Shotton to Derby County for a combined cost of £2m – so in all are around £2.3m up on net transfer spend. No wonder Hughes is being rewarded with a new three-year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days. His connections, influence, and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns. The acquisition of Bojan, once the rising star of Barcelona, was smoothed by Hughes’s association with the Catalan giants. The player’s glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury, after initial struggles, a testament to Hughes’s motivational skills. Bojan Krkic hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury . Clearly the support network from chairman Peter Coates, a Stoke fan since a boy and generous benefactor, and chief executive Tony Scholes enables Hughes to work to his full potential. The foundations laid by Tony Pulis in getting Stoke up from the Championship seven years ago and stabilising the club as a Premier League presence will never be forgotten. But Hughes has built on that, altering the side’s style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made Pulis’s reign so successful. The four forwards in his 4-2-3-1 system are interchangeable, with Moses, Diouf, Bojan, Jon Walters, Marko Arnautovic, Stephen Ireland, Charlie Adam, and Peter Crouch forming various combinations throughout the campaign. No shining lights as such, they offer a mixture of pace, nimble dexterity, and brawn. Again the cost is worth noting. Arnautovic was £2m from Werder Bremen, Ireland a free from Aston Villa. Hughes’s other signings since taking charge have been Erik Pieters, £3m from PSV Eindhoven, Marc Muniesa, free from Barcelona, and Peter Odemwingie, a swap with Cardiff with Kenwyne Jones heading the other way. Chelsea loanee Victor Moses (right) celebrates scoring Stoke's opener against Everton . Hughes has spent £6.2m in four transfer windows and improved. In this climate that is phenomenal. Equivalent to one 10th of Angel Di Maria, let’s say. Stoke are not averse to opening the wallet. A £10m package for Xherdan Shaqiri was put together in January before the Swiss forward elected for Inter. But when Stoke have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge. Bojan has been out since late January after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until September. Odemwingie has been out the entire campaign with the same injury. Captain Ryan Shawcross has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet. Moses missed two months with a thigh problem, Glenn Whelan was sidelined for five weeks. Now Ireland is out with that gashed leg. Hughes has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at QPR . There have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods. Hughes has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope. When Muniesa and Marc Wilson were injured at the same time as Shawcross last month it looked foolhardy to have sent Robert Huth out on loan to Leicester. But Stoke adjusted and came through. After his disastrous spell at Queens Park Rangers, it appeared Hughes’s stock had fallen below Premier League level. Coates had faith and is being rewarded. Up next is a trip to face West Bromwich Albion and Pulis on March 14. Last year’ s Premier League manager of the year and former Stoke boss versus his successor in both respects? Victory for Hughes would only strengthen that argument.	Stoke City beat Everton 2-0 to move up to eighth in the Premier League .

(CNN)A Colorado woman whose fetus was cut from her womb in a stabbing attack last week has been released from the hospital, relatives say. Michelle Wilkins thought she was answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes on March 18 in Longmont. Instead, when she arrived at the purported seller's home, authorities say, she was attacked, beaten and her fetus was surgically removed. The baby did not survive. Dynel Lane, 34, has been held on $2 million bond as authorities weigh charges against the former nurse aide. While the attack on Wilkins has shocked her community for its brutality, many have also remarked on the 26-year-old's strength. Bleeding and stunned in a stranger's basement, Wilkins managed to lock herself in a room to prevent any further violence, called 911 and did what she could to stem the bleeding. Police officers Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, who responded to the call, told CNN affiliate KDVR they weren't prepared for the grisly scene. "She was covered from head to toe in blood," Sawyer said. Piotrowski told the station that Wilkins "saved her own life," describing her as " probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet." Wilkins is now out of the hospital, according to a family statement posted on their GoFundMe page, and she's "in a safe location" and "surrounded by family and friends." More than $65,000 has been raised so far.	Michelle Wilkins, 26, thought she was answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Instead, she was stabbed and her unborn child removed .
This is the dramatic moment an eagle swooped down and caught a startled duckling for dinner - before bending over to look its poor prey right in the eye. The bald eagle plucked the ruddy duck from the water and was carrying the bird back to a nest with its feet when it turned to take a look. The extraordinary moment was caught on camera by Phil Lanoue, who lives near Murrells Inlet in Huntington Beach State Park, South Carolina. This is the dramatic moment an eagle swooped down and caught a startled duckling for dinner - before bending over to look its poor prey right in the eye . The 60-year-old said: 'I saw the eagle swoop down and hit the water. 'It sat there for a few seconds and I knew it was trying to get something secured in its talons. 'Suddenly the eagle burst up out of the water with a freshly caught duckling. I think the unfortunate victim was a ruddy duck. 'The eagle flew off towards the nest with an evening meal for its babies. The eagle suddenly swoops down and hits the calm water after spotting its prey from the air . After sitting for a few seconds the eagle emerges with a tiny duckling grasped precariously in its talons . Photographer Phil Lanoue said: 'Suddenly the eagle burst up out of the water with a freshly caught duckling. I think the unfortunate victim was a ruddy duck' 'I just couldn't believe it when the eagle looked right back at the duck and stared into its eyes as the poor little guy was being carried away.' The bald eagle is the only eagle unique to North America. They generally eat dead or drying fish, mice, snakes, rabbits and frogs. The huge bird of prey hurries toward a nest, where the little duck will be used to feed hungry chicks .

Atlanta (CNN)Former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the White House on its strategy in Iraq, despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer, then lying to the FBI. The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday. Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. "Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country," Earnest said. "He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice." Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That claim turned out to be false as the FBI found the notebooks when they conducted a search of Petraeus' house in 2013. When he was questioned by the FBI at the time, he lied and claimed he never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to court documents. Earnest says he is unaware of any particular security precautions put in place by the White House when it consults with Petraeus, despite his legal problems and lack of CIA security clearance. Petraeus is currently the chairman of a global institute for private equity firm KKR.	The Obama administration has consulted with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS .

Men in 'immaculate suits' are tricking motorway drivers into believing they are stranded, then taking their money in exchange for fake jewellery. There were a staggering 26 incidents on the M4, M40 and M25 in five days, according to detectives who have urged commuters to be vigilant. The conmen tell innocent motorists who stop to help that they ran out of petrol and their loved one has died - so they need money to get home immediately. In return, the gang members have been offering fake gold rings as 'security' in exchange for the cash to buy petrol. Conmen: There were a staggering 26 incidents on the M4, M40 and M25 (pictured) involving men in 'immaculate suits' who tricked motorists out of cash by convincing them they are stranded . Inspector Colin Clark from Thames Valley Police said: 'In some of these cases the men stopping motorists were well-dressed and wearing suits. 'Some stated that a relative had died or that they had run out of petrol and needed money. 'The offenders were often parked in areas which put themselves and other road users at risk. 'We take all reports seriously and take appropriate action against anyone found to be offending.' The incidents all took place on the M25, the M4 and the M40 motorways across Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: 'People getting conned on motorways is deeply disturbing and this is exactly the sort of thing we at the AA warn drivers to watch out for. Lies: The conmen have been lying to innocent motorists who stop to help by telling them they have run out of petrol and a relative has died so they need money to get home immediately (M4 pictured) 'It has been happening in Europe and it is very worrying to see it happening here. 'It could be argued that if people are dumb enough to hand over money then in a way, they deserve to be ripped off, but the fact of the matter is that it is a scam that has been happening in other parts of the world. 'The problem is where they go from here. Our advice for people who come across these conmen is to politely say no, drive a safe distance away and immediately call the police. 'The way to deal with these conmen is to catch them in the act. We must get the message through that we will not stand for people getting ripped off on the roadside.'

Charges against a garbage collector outside Atlanta who had been sentenced to 30 days in prison for starting his work too early have been dropped. Kevin McGill, 48, who works for Waste Management Inc, took a guilty plea deal after violating an ordinance in Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta, that bans collections before 7am - he would reportedly start collecting around 5am. But Sandy Springs Solicitors Office released a statement on Monday announcing that charges had been dropped after realizing that 'there are times when taking a step back provides the opportunity for better perspective'. Scroll down for video . Dropped charges: Kevin McGill, 48, was supposed to serve 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to picking up trash in Sandy Springs, Georgia, before 7am. But Sandy Springs Solicitors Office dropped the charges . The statement read: 'In retrospect, the actions of the court with regards to Mr. McGill’s sentence for violating the city’s noise laws, was disproportionate to a first-time offense. 'As such, the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation suspended. 'City ordinances are implemented for the protection of quality of life within a community. The adherence to these laws is important, and the City is obligated to enforce these laws, which includes imposing sanctions against those individuals who break the law. McGill was originally sentenced on February 20th at the local courthouse, the running of which was handed over to private contractors by the city. There were no real negotiations between her client and Court Chief Solicitor Bill Riley when he was sentenced, attorney Kimberly Bandoh told Daily Mail Online on Saturday, adding that the solicitor had claimed the offense meant 'automatic jail time'. Daily Mail Online reached out to Bandoh again on Monday but her office was closed. McGill turned 48 on Friday, but reported to a local jail at 6pm for his first night in jail. Sandy Springs solicitor Bill Riley said last week that it was the right decision to punish McGill, rather than his company, Waste Management . Justice served: McGill's attorney Kimberly Bandoh (pictured) said were no real negotiations between her client and Court Chief Solicitor Bill Riley when he was sentenced . He was allowed to serve his time on the weekends so he can still work collecting wealthy residents' trash so he can support his wife and two children. Riley has stood by the request for jail and says that 'fines don't seem to work' and 'The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail.' The solicitor said that residents of Sandy Springs, which include professional athletes and executives for Delta Air Lines, begin calling 9-1-1 when they hear early garbage men, according to WSPA. He said it was the right decision to punish McGill, who had only been on the route for three months, rather than his company, which the city has contracted to pick up its residents' trash. The prosecutor said that early garbage collections are a nuisance to residents who want to sleep and that his office had met with Waste Management after previously punishing its employees for violating the ordinance. A representative for the company went to the courthouse with McGill, who expected to be ordered to pay up to a $1,000 fine, Bandoh said. Marla Prince, a spokesperson for for the company, told DailyMail Online that 'The incident with WM employee Kevin McGill is very unfortunate and we are currently working with WM Legal Counsel to resolve the situation'. She said she had not heard of a driver going to jail for a similar incident in the firm's South Atlantic area of Georgia and the Carolinas. Prince added that Waste Management, which operates throughout the United States and reported $14billion in revenue in 2014, would coordinate with its employee about his work schedule and jail time. Sharon Kraun, a spokesman for Sandy Springs, told Daily Mail Online that McGill's citation stemmed from an incident where his truck had been photographed by a resident. The city had seen a previous case where a garbage man was given jail time several years ago and that while no similar cases had happened since, the collectors had 'fair warning', Kraun said. She said that Waste Management, which had amassed thousands of dollars in fines with the municipality in the last year, suspended McGill for violating its policies before he went to court. Waste Management could not answer questions about McGill's employment history with the company as of Saturday morning and said it was 'currently still investigating all the facts in the case'. Wealth: Sandy Springs, a suburb that has seen residents such as business executives, Herman Cain and Akon, has contracted out most of its services, including the court system . His lawyer questioned the practice of going after  trash collectors personally. 'He's the employee. He's not the employer. Sentencing him to jail is doing what?' Bandoh said. 'This is the most excessive punishment for an ordinance of this nature I've ever seen,' she said. McGill had never been to jail or even appeared in the court system, and no other charges factored into the judge's decision to give him jail time. He began serving his sentence last weekend for the February 5th citation and will continue losing his free time into the summer. Bandoh said that the sentence was originally for 30 straight days before someone in the court spoke up and said that McGill should continue working and collecting the suburb's trash. The worker was also sentenced to six months of probation, in which he would have had to pay fees to Sandy Springs, according to Vice. The suburb has privatized almost all of its city services, including its municipal courts, its communications, parks, economic development and call center operations. Its website states that 'this business model fosters a proactive, responsive and efficient approach to providing city services.' Residents of the area include  former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain and rapper Akon, according to the New York Times.
