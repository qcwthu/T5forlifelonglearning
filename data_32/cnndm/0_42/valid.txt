England will be represented in the World Cup final after all - by two of its umpires. Richard Kettleborough will be in the middle at the MCG on Sunday, alongside Sri Lanka's Kumar Dharmasena, when tournament co-hosts Australia and New Zealand do battle. England were always long shots to reach the final but in the event did not do themselves justice, making an embarrassing early exit before the knockout stages even began.

New Zealand booked their place in the final with a thrilling four-wicket win over South Africa in Auckland . Australia thrashed India in Sydney to set up a clash with their co-hosts at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Their absence this weekend put their officials in a favourable position to be involved instead - given the need for neutral umpires - and Ian Gould will join Kettleborough in Melbourne, as the reserve appointment. Sri Lankan Ranjan Madugalle will be match referee, and South Africa's Marais Erasmus the third umpire who must advise his on-field colleagues with audio-video evidence for DRS deliberations.

It takes a lot to steal the show from the notoriously flamboyant Eurovision entries, but this Swedish sign language interpreter's energetic moves and expressive gestures have managed to do just that. Tommy Krångh has become an overnight sensation in Sweden after putting on the performance of his life, interpreting pop singer Magnus Carlsson's attempt to enter Eurovision. But while Carlsson's upbeat tune may have failed to impress audiences in the Scandinavian country, being voted ninth out of 12 entries vying to represent at the annual competition, many are now calling for 48-year-old Krångh to take the stage for Sweden in Vienna this May. Star: Tommy Krångh has become an overnight sensation in Sweden after he appeared on national television . Hit: Krångh interpreted pop singer Magnus Carlsson's bid for Eurovision glory . Clicks: But while Carlsson's song only came ninth out of 12 entries, it has been shared thousands of times . Shared: And it is all down to Krångh's exuberant interpretation - complete with hip wiggles . The video of Krångh's exuberant interpretation has been shared thousands of times in Sweden, and across the world. The delighted interpreter has told Swedish newspapers he was 'thrilled' with the reaction - and has been 'love-bombed' on Twitter by people who enjoyed his energetic performance, even getting the odd marriage proposal. 'It´s been absolutely amazing,' he told MailOnline. 'I´ve been love-bombed from a thousands of people. People are even proposing to marry me. This is something I could never imagine. 'It's a once in lifetime experience after being a signer for so many years. I love that sign language gets so much attention at the moment.' Hilarious: Krångh says he has been 'love-bombed' on social media since the show went out . Interpretation: He hopes his translation enables deaf people to get the 'feel' of the song . Water cooler: He wants deaf people to be able to discuss the song at work just like their hearing colleages . Krångh told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet he 'just get funky and let go' when he got up on stage. Speaking to MailOnline, he added: 'The music is a part of your entire body. 'That is the charming thing with sign language it is so expressive and when you hear the music you basically freak out and loose yourself.' Meanwhile, he revealed that his aim is to ensure deaf people could grasp the message the singer was trying to convey. 'We get the songs a few weeks before the contest and then its up to you to analyze the song,' he explained. 'What is the message, if there is a message for that matter, what does the artist want with the song. How do you get into the rhythm and so forth. 'The important thing is that people who can´t hear is suppose to get the same experience as people who can. 'They should be able to have an opinion about the song, just like everyone else.' Future: It is not clear whether Krångh is going to be the interpreter for this year's Swedish entry yet . Entry: Sweden is going to be represented by Måns Zelmerlöw, who won the public vote . Top marks: However, it seems the Swedish public would give 'dix points' if Krångh is the interpreter . It is not yet clear whether Krångh will be heading to Vienna as the official sign language interpreter. Sweden is going to be represented by Måns Zelmerlöw this year, and he will no doubt be hoping to take home the trophy. But it seems the Swedes might be a little sad if Krångh doesn't make an appearance. 'I know that Måns will make us proud in Vienna, but I would not say no if I was asked,' he told MailOnline. 'Perhaps we could both be on stage,' added Krångh, who also revealed his 'dream artist' to work with would be Celine Dion. Krångh is not the first Swedish interpreter to capture the imagination of the nation. The last time Sweden won Eurovision three years ago with Euphoria, by Loreen, an interpreter managed to steal a bit of the limelight from the main act. Precedent: This sign language interpretation was also a hit three years ago . Trophy: That year's winner, Euphoria, by Loreen, came complete with an emotive interpretation .	Tommy Krångh, 48, has become a celebrity in his native Sweden . The sign language interpreter gave an exuberant translation of Magnus Carlsson's attempt to represent Sweden at this year's Eurovision . While Carlsson's song failed to impress, Krångh interpretation was a hit . Delighted signer says he has been 'love-bombed' on social media . There are now calls for him to take part in this year's contest, in Vienna .

MPs have accused bosses of HSBC of being ‘utterly incompetent’ and ducking responsibility for the Swiss tax dodging scandal. Chris Meares, who ran HSBC’s global private banking arm between 2006 and 2011, told the Public Accounts Committee he was not aware of alleged tax evasion taking place on his watch. Asked repeatedly whether he accepted personal responsibility for the scandal, he said he took responsibility for ‘controls failings’ which allowed the wrongdoing to occur. But he added: ‘I do not take fairly direct responsibility for individual actions of people in Switzerland that I was unaware of.' Scroll down for video . Chris Meares, who ran HSBC’s global private banking arm between 2006 and 2011, told the Public Accounts Committee he was not aware of alleged tax evasion taking place on his watch . Chief executive Stuart Gulliver and HSBC board director Rona Fairhead also angered MPs by insisting they were oblivious to the wrongdoing in Switzerland, where staff allegedly helped wealthy clients including arms dealers and a blood diamond smuggler evade taxes between 2005 and 2007. The committee’s chairman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, said: ‘Nobody at the bank... has deigned to accept responsibility for what was massive, illegal terrible tax evasion.’ She added: ‘Either you were incompetent, completely and utterly incompetent, in your oversight duties or you knew about it… I don’t believe you did not know.’ Her fellow committee members also expressed disbelief that HSBC’s bosses in London were unaware of what was happening in Switzerland. Conservative MP David Burrows said: ‘You are asking us to accept that Switzerland was off on a frolic on its own - that nobody in London knew what was going on’. He added: ‘I cannot believe that nobody knew the unlawful actions that were taking place in Switzerland, and if they didn’t know then they jolly well should have done. ‘What we’ve essentially got is blind eye knowledge – holding the telescope to the blind eye so that you in London didn’t see what you suspected was going on in Switzerland.’ Question time: MPs accused BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead as either being aware of wrongdoing or being 'utterly incompetent' HSBC’s chairman Douglas Flint has already heaped blame on Mr Meares and his predecessor Clive Bannister, the son of four-minute mile legend Sir Roger Bannister, who now runs insurance company Phoenix. Mr Flint told the Treasury Select Committee last month that the two men ‘certainly bear fairly direct responsibility’. Yesterday, Mr Meares - who is now chairman of fund manager Quilter Cheviot - rejected claims that he was being made the ‘fall guy’ by HSBC. But he was described as a ‘wholly unreliable witness’ by Conservative MP Stephen Hammond.	Former HSBC private banking boss said he was unaware of tax evasion .

Roy Keane is back at Old Trafford as a pundit for BBC Sport ahead of Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester United and Arsenal. The former United captain joined presenter Gary Lineker, former adversary Alan Shearer and Ian Wright in the Old Trafford studio to provide his views on the quarter-final clash. Keane, who has never been afraid to air his views either in his TV work or in his two autobiographies, was working with the BBC for the first time having previously worked for ITV. Roy Keane (left), Alan Shearer (centre) and Ian Wright (right) were working for the BBC as pundits on Monday . Gary Lineker addresses the punditry trio during some of their heated pre-match discussion at Old Trafford . Keane was famously red carded for lashing out at Shearer with a punch at St James' Park in 2001 - but the pair seemed happy enough to sit next to each other in the studio on Monday. He also joked that he hated Wright, who played for Arsenal while the pair were both players and there were moments that their debate became heated at Old Trafford. In Keane's book The Second Half, he includes Shearer, on a list with Alf-Inge Haaland, Rob Lee, David Batty and Patrick Vieira in as players 'at the back of my mind'. Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other. Wright talked briefly about the rivalry and hatred between Arsenal and Manchester United . Shearer rows with Keane during their playing careers back in 2001 - and they were back together for TV . Last year, Wright claimed in a video on his YouTube channel that Keane was the best TV pundit around at the moment. 'Roy Keane is the best,' the former Arsenal striker said. 'He's got credibility and he's another one who doesn't care what anyone thinks. What he says is most probably right but it's brutally honest and some people don't like that.' Keane last worked for ITV on their coverage of Chelsea's Champions League first-leg draw against Paris Saint-Germain on February 17.

The first man struck in Marion 'Suge' Knight's deadly hit-and-run later told officers that he physically assaulted the former rap mogul before the confrontation, a police report reveals. 'I f***** him up!' Cle 'Bone' Sloan, a former gang member, told the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, according to the documents. Sloan reportedly admitted to attacking Knight, the 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row records, as he lay in a hospital bed suffering from multiple head wounds. Terry Carter, a 55-year-old father, was the second man to be hit by Knight's truck. He died from the injuries he sustained. Scroll down for video . Marion 'Suge' Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder after a hit-and-run incident on January 29 in a Compton, California, parking lot. His lawyer Matthew Fletcher, pictured left on March 9, has said that 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail' Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) and Terry Carter (right) were the victims of the hit-and-run. Carter died of his injuries, while Sloan is recovering and allegedly told police that he 'f***** up' Knight before being run over . Sloan, 51, allegedly said that he had a verbal dispute on January 29 with Knight three miles away from the scene of the hit-and-run, according to the New York Daily News. It is believed to have been a result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton.' He then allegedly headed straight for Knight when he saw him at Tam's Burgers in Compton, California, - the location of the hit-and-run - about half an hour later. 'Sloan said he contacted Knight and began to punch him through the driver side window,' the report read. 'Sloan stated Knight tried to exit the red Ford but was stopped by his punches.' Sloan was walking away when he heard someone say, 'Look out', according to his account to the police. He said he was trying to turn around but was then struck by Knight's Ford F-150 Raptor. Knight's lawyer told the Daily News that Sloan had initiated both confrontations and that the former rapper never left his car. 'Sloan is trying to exculpate himself but all the while he's just killing himself. It's monumental,' lawyer Matthew Fletcher told Daily News. Knight (pictured on March 9, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is in jail without bail. His lawyer Fletcher has said that Knight never exited the vehicle and was acting in self defense .

Suge never exited his vehicle. He was accosted by Sloan who challenged him to fight,' he added. Fletcher had previously said that Knight was acting in self defense to get away from what he thought was an armed assault. Carter made a one-minute call to Knight at 2.36pm the day of the incidents, phone records included in the police report said. Nineteen minutes later, police were called to Tam's about the alleged hit-and-run. Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder, but he pleaded not guilty and is in jail without bail. Though prosecutors claim Knight intentionally hit Sloan and Carter with his truck, Fletcher believes 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail'. 'Sloan's own words probe he drove across the entire city of Compton in order to have a confrontation with Mr Knight,' Fletcher told the Daily News. 'Mr Sloan proved by his own words what his intentions were and what he accomplished.'	Cle 'Bone' Sloan allegedly told comment to police as he was in hospital .

De La Hoya knows all about both boxers having lost to both Pacquiao and Mayweather during his professional career and believes the Filipino will be a tough challenge for the unbeaten American due to his southpaw stance.

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has said he will not leave the BBC show without a fight - and is already considering a new show based around farming. Clarkson is said to be in discussions with Andy Williams, his long standing collaborator and Top Gear's executive producer, to star in a new farming show - just days after he launched into an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala. Speculation is mounting over what will happen to one of the BBC's biggest stars when his fate is finally decided at a meeting this week. Jeremy Clarkson (pictured on Countryfile) is said to be in discussions with Andy Williams, Top Gear's executive producer, over starring in a new farming show . He told the Sunday Mirror today that he has been 'put on silence' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations he punched Oisin Tymon, a 36-year-old Top Gear producer, in a row over the lack of catering. Clarkson told the paper: 'I've been put on silence. There are very good reasons from my point of view why I simply can't say a word.' His future at the BBC is to be decided next week when the corporation's internal probe into his 'fracas' with Mr Tymon is put before Director-General Tony Hall. But sources close to the presenter told the paper that if he is sacked he will probably sue for wrongful dismissal. They said he is still 'fuming' about the top BBC boss who allegedly compared his situation to paedophile Jimmy Savile's - and  has vowed to find out who it was. Clarkson was embroiled in a row with BBC after he allegedly punched his producer Oisin Tymon . An insider said Clarkson thinks BBC bosses have launched a smear campaign against him and he 'won't let that go'. The paper also revealed that the BBC are already filming the pilot of an alternative motoring show called 'The Getaway'. The Sunday Times has reported that Clarkson is already considering a change in direction - and may become the face of a new documentary series on farming. The paper reports Clarkson originally took the idea to then BBC director General George Entwistle in 2012 but it did not get the go-ahead. But following the now infamous fracas and the uncertainty surrounding his current job, Clarkson it said to be preparing a new proposal for the show. A source told the paper: 'In the last week Jeremy has had a chance to firm it up. It's about trying to run a farm when you don't know anything about farming and getting things wrong... in a Top Gear-esque way.' In 2012, Clarkson told the Radio Times: 'I love the idea of being a farmer, that's why I like watching Adam's Farm [on Countryfile]. But farming land is complex. It's a business, but it's important to me that the land looks beautiful too.'	Jeremy Clarkson is said to be keen to appear in a new farming show .

Clarkson also said he has been 'put on silence' over the 'fracas'
When it comes to four-wheel grand prix racing, Britain’s future looks in good hands. Lewis Hamilton is the Formula One world champion, and judging by the form he showed to win the Australian Grand Prix, he looks in good shape to become the first ever British driver to retain his title. But glance towards two-wheel grand prix racing and you will find Britain is still dining off championships and even race wins from the late great Barry Sheene. Britain's Cal Crutchlow will be riding for the LCR Honda team during the 2015 MotoGP season . Crutchlow hopes to hit the front of the MotoGP grid with Honda after a disappointing year with Ducati . MotoGP has arrived in Qatar to kick off the 2015 season on Sunday, and while Britain is looking for its first premier class victory since Sheene triumphed in Sweden in 1981 – its future also looks intriguingly bright. YEAR . 2014 . 2013 . 2012 . 2011 . TEAM . Ducati . Tech3 . Tech3 . Tech3 . PLACING . 13th (74 pts) 5th (188 pts) 7th (151 pts) 12th (70 pts) In fact, the talent coming through is arguably showing greater promise than that seen in F1 right now. Bradley Smith, 24, and Scott Redding, 22, impressed during 2014 and will be targeting podium finishes as a realistic possibility this season. For Cal Crutchlow, he’s been there before – often narrowly missing out on the top step of the podium in 2013. But following a terrible season at Ducati last year, the Coventry born star once again looks in a position where he could sneak on an opportunity to end Britain’s 34-year wait for a premier class race win. In 2015, Crutchlow will be on a Honda bike not too far off the specification ridden by double world champion Marc Marquez, who dominated the 2014 campaign after winning the opening 10 races on his factory Honda. Crutchlow tests his LCR Honda around Malaysia's Sepang circuit during a pre-season test for his new team . The Brit has also been testing at Qatar's Losail circuit - posting impressive lap times . Riding for the satellite LCR Honda outfit, race wins are not expected but they certainly won’t be ruled out. It’s very much the same scenario that Crutchlow was in at Yamaha’s Tech3 team in 2012 and 2013 and one the 29-year-old is aiming to return to. ‘So many guys could get on the podium.’ Crutchlow told Sportsmail. ‘There are 15 guys that are all so close at the moment. ‘I’d like to say my chances of getting on the podium are more than they were last year. If I could get back to where I was in 2013 and 2012, I’d be quite happy because we were competitive enough there when I finished fifth and seventh in the championship. They were good years.’ Crutchlow sounds upbeat. There’s a positive tone to his voice and a calmness to him which suggests he is much happier now than when I spoke to him at Silverstone last August, shortly after his Ducati departure following just one season was confirmed. Ducati was always going to be a tough monster to tame. Even the great Valentino Rossi gave up on the bike following two highly uncompetitive years. Crutchlow reflects that while he has no resentment towards the team, he was constantly on the back foot following a big crash in just his second race on the Desmosedici. 'The Austin crash wrecked the season for me,' Crutchlow added. 'From that point on it was a downward spiral because I was riding injured for a long time but up until Texas I was riding good and was really confident. Cal Crutchlow rides his Ducati around Aragon during practice for last year's grand prix . Crutchlow would on to clinch third behind Aleix Espargaro (left) and race winner Jorge Lorenzo during the Grand Prix at Aragon late in the season which would prove to be his only podium with Ducati . ‘When I crashed at Texas, it was through no fault of my own. It was of the biggest crashes that I’ve ever had when I really hurt my hand but I came back too soon. The other two Ducati riders were riding really well at the time and it was like a double whammy. ‘We came back towards the end of the season and we started to ride very strongly, but I enjoyed my time at Ducati and they look to be doing a great job this year.’ Crutchlow referred to the testing times that saw Andrea Dovizioso top the time sheets in a pre-season Qatar test, but it’s not just the Italian outfit that are on resurgence. Having ridden much of 2014 injured, Crutchlow states that he is going into the new season with no problems and that includes on his unfamiliar Honda where he aims to get more potential out of a bike which has already produced encouraging testing times in Malaysia. ‘I feel good, I feel strong and my physical condition is no problem. But racing a motorcycle is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world and people don’t really realise that. ‘It’s more than twisting the throttle and braking. We have average heart rates of 192-200BPM over 45 minutes. ‘When I was at Yamaha it was different [learning a new bike]. I was coming from World Superbikes and the bike was completely different to anything I knew at all. The second and third years were quite similar to where I am now. Crutchlow has previously mixed with the top guns in MotoGP, finishing second behind Marc Marquez (centre) and Valentino Rossi (right) in the 2013 German Grand Prix at the Sachsenring while with Tech3 Yamaha . Crutchlow claimed four podium finishes with Tech3 Yamaha in 2013 including a second place at Le Mans . Crutchlow lifts the front wheel of his Tech3 Yamaha during a 2013 pre-season test at Jerez . ‘Last year was a little tougher for me to get used to the Ducati, but I was still quite confident even then. ‘I‘ve been happy enough with my testing times, but I haven’t taken advantage enough of the new tyre which I thought I would take. But that’s just the way it is. The Honda you don’t take advantage as much as you would with the other bikes. ‘But learning to ride the bike is more important. It’s been encouraging, the long run I did in Malaysia was ok, and of course I didn’t do the long run in Qatar because of the rain.’ The subject of the British Grand Prix comes up. Considering Silverstone is a venue where Crutchlow’s crashes see him visit the medical centre more than the podium in recent times, even he can admit that the circuit stepping in for the next two years to cover for the lagging Circuit of Wales project is a good thing. Silverstone is the familiar home of the British Grand Prix in Formula One, but the circuit has also stepped in to replace Donington and the Circuit of Wales to host MotoGP for the next two years . ‘It’s good. It should never have left us - not when there is not a circuit to go to. Silverstone have put is so much time and effort to get us there in the first place and they really listened to the riders. ‘Then they said it was going to Donington because the Circuit of Wales was not built and I didn’t think that was right. They might as well have kept it at Silverstone so it’s good to be back there.' So with a British Grand Prix in place (where an impressive 138,000 fans attended over the 2014 weekend) and talent clearly coming through the system – why has Britain struggled so badly to find a premier class winner? With a hint of frustration, Crutchlow states that the money being poured into MotoGP over in Italy and Spain is harming the opportunity for Brits to land top rides. ‘We don’t get the opportunity. There’s been no British riders on factory bikes. The year I was in a factory team, the bike wasn’t capable of winning, we saw that. There’s not been a chance to get on a factory Honda or Yamaha when it’s winning and that’s down to the system I feel. ‘There’s not enough money going to the riders like there is in Italy and Spain, and it’s just endless.’ The 2015 MotoGP season gets underway on 29th March in Qatar, you can watch this race and all the other action throughout the year exclusively live only on BT Sport.

A French court has ruled that that it has jurisdiction to judge a case against Facebook, after the U.S.-based social network blocked a man's account for posting a painting of a woman's genitals. The Frenchman, a teacher and a father-of-three, posted an explicit 19th-century oil painting depicting the lower half of a naked woman in 2011, and was subsequently blocked. The man sued Facebook that year, but lawyers representing the social network has argued that it does not fall under French jurisdiction. Blocked account: The Frenchman, a teacher and father-of-three, was blocked after posting an image of Gustave Coubet's painting The Origin Of The World on his Facebook account . The unnamed man had posted an image of  Gustave Coubet's painting The Origin Of The World on the social networking site four years ago. He claims he missed messages and 'social contact' from his 800 Facebook friends when the page was taken down on the eve of his birthday on February 27, 2011. At the time, the unnamed man's lawyer Stephane Cottineau said repeated emails to the California based company demanding the page be reinstated had also gone unanswered. He added: 'This blind censorship and refusal to reply to emails suggests he is not worthy of their attention and is someone who has acted immorally or illegally. 'Deleting his account is a breach of his human rights, which guarantees my client's freedom of expression. French rules: The Paris court has ruled that that it does have jurisdiction to judge a case against Facebook, despite the U.S.-based social network arguing it has to be done in California . 'It is also in breach of his rights as a consumer under French law.' Earlier this year, Facebook's lawyer Caroline Lyannaz argued that the site did not fall under French jurisdiction as users have to sign a clause agreeing that only a California court can rule in disputes relating to the firm. Facebook's rules state users 'will not post content that is hateful, threatening, or pornographic, or that incites violence, or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.' However, a Paris court ruled yesterday that Facebook's clause forcing all users to agree that any litigation must be based in the U.S. state, where the site is based, was 'abusive'. Mr Cottineau hailed the court ruling as a 'first victory won by David against Goliath'. 'This decision will create jurisprudence for other social media and other Internet giants who use their being headquartered abroad, mainly in the United States, to attempt to evade French law.' The lawyer said this was an 'abusive clause' as none of the 22 million Facebook users in France 'can ever take recourse to French legal jurisdiction in the event of a dispute.' Facebook said it noted the judgement and was considering its response. The court will hear the case on May 21.	Man posted 19th-century painting of woman's genitals on Facebook .

(CNN)A  Los Angeles police officer wanted on murder charges "should be considered armed and dangerous," according to authorities. Police in Pomona, California -- about 30 miles east of L.A -- issued an arrest warrant Monday for Henry Solis, an LAPD rookie, in the shooting death of a local man over the weekend. According to witnesses, shots were fired in the predawn hours Saturday after a struggle between a shooter and a victim before a compact car was seen rushing off. The victim -- identified as 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr. -- later died at a Los Angeles hospital. Investigators looking for clues discovered an abandoned car about three blocks away from the scene that belonged to Solis. Authorities soon began looking for the 27-year-old cop to question him, but so far, he has not turned up. "The suspect knows he is wanted, and that police are actively searching for him.," Pomona police said in a statement. The LAPD is helping them look for him. Solis, who is still in his probationary phase, was off duty when the killing happened and has not reported back since. Police have not said how Solis may have been involved in the killing, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Residents have built a memorial to Rodriguez, a trucker, at the street corner where he collapsed. Sunday afternoon, they held a vigil and played his favorite songs. They said he put God and family first. "He was just sweet," Sandra Soto told KTLA. "He was my best friend." CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.	Arrest warrant issued for LAPD officer on murder charges . Police found an odd clue blocks from a shooting scene -- the officer's abandoned car .
England forward Danny Welbeck is set for a 'great future' at Arsenal, but manager Arsene Wenger warned all his players their first duty is to serve the club - whether that is on the pitch or on the bench. Welbeck joined the Gunners on transfer deadline day from Manchester United, where he had become frustrated at a lack of opportunities in his preferred central striker role. Since the return to fitness and form of Olivier Giroud, who spent four months out with a broken leg, the 24-year-old has found himself deployed on the flank of a front three along with Alexis Sanchez, rather than down the middle. Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United last summer after growing frustrated at bit-part role . The striker was left on the bench for Wednesday's Premier League match against QPR . Welbeck was a late substitute for both of the previous two Barclays Premier League matches, but could face his former club in Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford. Wenger is convinced Welbeck, who has seven Arsenal goals, can play a big part in the future of the team, but like everyone else has to earn their place in the starting XI. 'Danny Welbeck puts big team effort in, he plays very well for me and is an exceptional player who will have a great future here,' said Wenger, who confirmed centre-back Gabriel Paulista was set for 'two to three weeks' out with a hamstring injury suffered in the midweek Barclays Premier League win over QPR at Loftus Road. 'The subject is raised because he is a former Man United player, (but) I am very, very happy that I bought him.' Wenger continued: 'Welbeck is very important and has played many, many games since the start of the season. The England international was also absent from the starting line-up against Everton last Sunday . Arsene Wenger says Welbeck has a bright future at Arsenal but faces a lot of competition . 'His position is one of the three up front, central, left or right. He can play anywhere.' England forward Theo Walcott is another who has watched on from the bench in recent weeks, as Wenger finally enjoys the luxury of strength in depth. The Arsenal boss added: 'We have a lot of competition going on in the team, especially up front - we have plenty of offensive potential. It makes every decision more difficult. 'People always raise these kind of questions when (either) you do not have enough players, or when you do have enough players. '(However), we have chosen a job where competition is part of our job. That means we can't complain about that, because we have made that choice. 'Our job is to serve the club and to compete with other people to do as well as we can to serve the club. The 24-year-old could return to the side for Monday night's FA Cup clash against former side United . Wenger confirmed he will be without defender Gabriel for up to three weeks due to a hamstring injury . 'The only important thing is what the club achieves - all of us are only here for that.' Arsenal have a poor record at Old Trafford, not winning since September 2006 and suffering an 8-2 thumping there in August 2011. Wenger, though, sees no reason why the Gunners, who are ahead of United in the Premier League table, should not be able to produce the required performance this time around. 'I don't believe too much in history, I just believe in the performance on the day,' he said. 'At the moment we are doing very well away from home. The size of the pitch is exactly the same everywhere, it is just down to how much we turn up and how much effort we put in to win the game. 'Both teams will think if we get over this hurdle, we have a good opportunity to win the competition. Wenger was forced to defend Mesut Ozil after criticism from former United midfielder Paul Scholes . 'We are confident from our Premier League run, so we go to Manchester United to qualify and to give absolutely everything.' Wenger, meanwhile, rejected criticism of Mesut Ozil by former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, who claimed the German playmaker was only 'going through the motions' at Arsenal. 'I think a player like Paul Scholes would have loved to play with Mesut Ozil,' Wenger said. 'We are all in a job where in every single game we have to prove a point. 'I believe Ozil has the quality, he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows. 'You can be cheated a little bit by his style of play, because he is fluent, easy, subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in, but he does.'

Arsene Wenger insists the England forward has a bright future at the club . Arsenal have a lot of competition particularly in the forward area .
'Speak out': Ronald Lauder - the billionaire son of Estee Lauder - told a congressional committee in Washington that American must take the lead . European Jews are living in fear 'like the 1930s', the World Jewish Congress leader has warned as he called on the U.S. to speak out against the rise of anti-Semitism across the continent. Ronald Lauder - the billionaire son of Estee Lauder -  told a congressional committee in Washington that America must take the lead against the surge in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe in order to 'defeat the new flame of Islamic terror'. He pointed to the strong line taken by European leaders in the wake of attacks like those seen in Paris, Toulouse and Copenhagen earlier this year, and urged the U.S. to follow in their footsteps. 'Once again, like the 1930s, European Jews live in fear,' said Lauder. 'The United States can and must speak loudly and clearly to condemn this evil for what it is - the radical Islamic hatred of Jews.' Mr Lauder, who has led the World Jewish Congress since 2007, pointed to the fact Jews make up just one per cent of France's population, yet were victim to half the country's racist attacks. He also noted that anti-Semitic attacks have not only doubled in France in the past year, but also in the UK and Austria. He stressed: 'To defeat this new flame of radical Islamic terror and survive... the United States must lead.' Mr Lauder also revealed a recent meeting with Jewish leaders in Rome had revealed they believed the Italian capital would have no Jewish community within 25 years. According to Forbes, Mr Lauder claimed they say their children and grandchildren will look for more welcoming countries in which to make their homes in in the future. 'There is a hatred growing throughout Europe that is causing Jews to wonder if they should leave. They are asking if there is a future for Jews on that continent,' he told the committee. Terror: The recent attacks in Paris (pictured), Toulouse and Copenhagen have left many in fear . Fear: Lauder says Jews are living in fear 'like the 1930s' after incidents like the Copenhagen attack (pictured) Mr Lauder was joined by two other members of the WJC, which represents Jewish communities in 100 countries, who echoed his fears. Dan Asmussen, a Danish Jewish leader, noted Danish society 'itself is not and has never been anti-Semitic and many of the threats facing Danish Jewry - like in the rest of Europe - come from marginalized and radicalized Muslims, and these form a small minority of all Muslims in Denmark.' Roger Cukierman, a French Jewish leader, added: 'This is a war against Western modern civilization. And the Jews are seen by these Jihadists as a privileged target. 'We Jews are the sentinels at the forefront of this war. But we are not the only victims. 'Military forces, policemen and women, journalists were also targeted and killed.'	Ronald Lauder told congressional committee U.S. needs to take the lead .

Authorities are conducting a new search on a Virginia mountain for the remains of two Maryland sisters who disappeared in 1975. The Bedford County Sheriff's Office said Monday that additional leads prompted another dig on Taylor's Mountain in Bedford County, but officials didn't provide details. The operation is expected to take several days. An earlier dig was conducted on the mountain in January. The sheriff's Office, the Virginia State Police and the Montgomery Police Department in Maryland are conducting the search for the remains of ten-year-old Katherine Lyon and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon. 12-year-old Sheila Lyon (left) and ten-year-old Katharine Lyon (right) went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations . The Lyon sisters never came home after walking to the mall together in 1975. A massive search turned up nothing . The girls went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations. The Lyon sisters never came home, and a massive search turned up nothing. Parents John and Mary Lyon have never been able to find out what happened to their daughters. Over four decades, police have pursued numerous leads and periodically identified potential suspects. But they never charged anyone. Authorities have, however, named Richard Allen Welch Sr. and his nephew, Lloyd Lee Welch, as persons of interest in the case. Neither man has been charged. In February it was revealed that Lloyd Lee Welch, a sex offender, told investigators that he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to  police affidavits. The Washington Post reported that Montgomery County police, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the affidavits or how credible they find 58-year-old Lloyd Welch's recent statements. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza (pictured, 1975) and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car . Though volunteers searched for the sisters, they came up with nothing. Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible . 'Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon,' Montgomery Police Chief Tom Manger said in February. 'We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation.' Richard Welch's wife, Patricia, was charged with perjury after testifying before the grand jury in December. The affidavits released in February did not say whether any incriminating evidence has been found on Taylor's Mountain in Virginia. Investigators have found bones on a property near Taylor's mountain that used to belong to the family of Lloyd Lee Welch, according to court papers. But that may not mean much because the land contains an old cemetery with more than 30 unmarked graves. At one point during the search, detectives wrote that a dog trained to sniff decomposition 'alerted' to areas away from the cemetery. On the day they vanished, the girls' older brother reported seeing them at the mall, and a friend claimed to have seen them talking to an older man who was carrying a microphone and a briefcase. Lloyd Welch told investigators he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to police affidavits unsealed in Febrary . Authorities have been searching for the remains of 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and 10-year-old Katharine Lyon on a remote mountain in Bedford County, Virginia, some 200 miles from their Montgomery County, Maryland, home, since September . A sketch of that man, who had long hair and a mustache, was created and circulated, but it didn't lead to any arrests. One person who provided details to a police artist said the man had been 'fixated' on the girls. Welch, who worked at a traveling carnival with his then girlfriend Helen Craver, had been at the mall and was seen paying attention to the Lyon girls, police chief Thomas Manger said. The filings detail for the first time how Lloyd Welch surfaced in the case. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car. Police gave him a polygraph test which showed he was lying, according to the affidavits, which did not say whether authorities continued to look into Welch. The detectives on the case in 2013 set out to learn more about Welch, who had been arrested in 1977 in Montgomery in a burglary case. His mug shot from that arrest strongly resembled a sketch in the Lyon sisters case that had been drawn based on a witness's description of a man at Wheaton Plaza who was staring at the girls and following them, according to the affidavits. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. The girls' father, John Lyon, became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones . Police searched property in Virginia (pictured) once owned by the family of drifter and convicted child rapist Lloyd Lee Welch . In 1994, he had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in South Carolina. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in Delaware and was sentenced to three decades in prison. The detectives went to Delaware, according to the affidavits, and interviewed Welch several times in prison. 'During these interviews, Lloyd Welch has admitted he left Wheaton Plaza in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared,' according to the affidavits, written by Montgomery Detective Mark Janney and Detectives R.D. Baldwin and S.O. Smith of the Bedford County Sheriff's Office. The affidavits say Lloyd Welch told police Richard Welch was involved in kidnapping the girls. Lloyd Welch said he was dropped off near his home, and the next day he went to Richard Welch's home where he saw the uncle sexually abusing one of the sisters. He said he left and never saw the girls again. Shelia and Katherine were on spring break when they disappeared. They left their home at 11am and their mother Mary Lyon told them to be home by 4pm. Mrs Lyon later said that in the quiet Washington, D.C., suburb, it was common to let children go to the shopping center alone. As the Montgomery County Gazette put it years later - it was a simpler time when everyone looked out for everyone else's children. The massive investigation that followed the girls' disappearance brought in countless tips and widespread national and local media coverage. Potential clues were found, but later discounted. People were brought in for questioning, but later released without charge. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon (left) would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon (right) would be 50 years old . Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. Mr Lyon became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones. The girls' brother, who was 15 at the time they vanished, became a homicide detective when he grew up. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Katherine Lyon was last seen wearing a baby beads necklace with orange beads and 'KATE' in black letters on white beads and dirty beige brushed suede wallaby type Jumping Jack shoes with dirty beige shoelaces. Sheila Lyon was last seen wearing farsighted gold wire rimmed glasses, low cut GallenKamp sneakers, size 6.5 or 7.5, with dirty white shoestrings, and knee socks. Katherine has a birthmark on the inside of her upper thigh. The organization also created age-progressed photographs of the sisters.

Glasses might be helpful for improved vision, but a new type are being tested that allow wearers to be invisible in unwanted photographs. Invisibility Glasses by AVG, a software security company, were designed in a bid to help protect people's online identities in the digital age. With the increased use of cell phone cameras in public, the glasses makes it difficult to capture a person's identity in facial recognition software, for example the kind used on Facebook.

The glasses, through the use of infrared light and retro-reflective materials, blocks attempts to get a clear facial capture of the wearer, developers claim . The wearable technology, which does not hide the rest of the person's body, debuted on Sunday at technology showcase Pepcom in Barcelona, according to Gizmodo. The developers of the privacy glasses, AVG Innovation Labs, said that with the advancement in facial recognition technologies like Facebook's DeepFace system, they began investigating how technology can be used when it comes to securing online privacy. DeepFace will be able to determine whether two captured faces are of the same person with 97.25 per cent accuracy. And this coupled with other advancements left developers questioning how to combat privacy. The glasses, through the use of infrared LED light and retro-reflective materials, block a clear facial capture of the wearer, developers claim. The retro-reflective materials on the glasses are designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful only during flash photography (above how retro-reflective materials work on the glasses) The infrared lights, placed around the eyes and nose areas of the glasses, breaks facial detection software. However, a drawback is that some cellphone camera sensors have infrared filters that are capable of cutting off any wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum. Through the use of infrared light and retro-reflective materials, the glasses are designed to protects people's online identities. 1) Infrared LED lights: They are completely invisible to human eyes, and are only detectable by cameras which are sensitive to the wavelengths of these lights. 2) Retro-reflective materials: They are claimed to help maintain privacy at the moment that the image is actually taken. While most surfaces reflect light by diffusing or scattering it in all directions, retro-reflective materials are specially designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful during flash photography. Above, an illustration for how retro-reflective materials in the glasses work . Source: AVG . The retro-reflective materials on the glasses are designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful only during flash photography. Tanweer Ali, Senior Developer at AVG's Innovation Labs, said that they designed the glasses after exploring the increasing risks of privacy in the digital age. 'With the increasing use of cellphone cameras in public places, the possibility of your picture or video being taken unaware and ending up on the internet is ever growing,' Ali wrote in a company blog post. 'Take Google's StreetView example, when they pictured random people in objectionable places or situations such as vomiting, being arrested etc., or filming inside their home fences. 'In some countries, Google is even allowed to keep the uncensored images for six months.' He then asked: 'How much of our visual identity can we protect from unwanted privacy invaders? 'Can we hide ourselves from cameras or interfere with the face-recognition technologies?' Ali's questions highlights a report that revealed depending on a smartphone's settings, the device could be using its built-in GPS capability to embed the exact location of the user into the file of photos captured on camera, according to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. In this process known as geotagging, if the photographs are shared online, criminals can track the user's movements based on the geotag and also find out where someone lives. Facebook automatically strips out geotags, according to the report. As the glasses are only a prototype, AVG said not to expect them on the market any time soon while they continue to explore how technology can combat privacy issues. Surprisingly, Invisibility Glasses are not the first of its kind to try and disguise people's identities. Earlier this year, Paul McCartney's DJ, Chris Holmes, debuted a line of reflective clothing that intentionally ruins paparazzi's highly-coveted photos by deflecting the light from their cameras. The collection, launched during Betabrand's Think Tank competition, includes a hooded jacket, an infinity scarf and a blazer that look like everyday pieces, but essentially act as a mirror when hit with bright light, rendering the wearer practically invisible in flash photography.

Jimmy Greaves did not attend Wembley on Sunday. A lot of people tend to get upset when this happens. The one who doesn’t is Jimmy Greaves. If he wanted to go, as a guest of either Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur, his former clubs, he could have secured a ticket, no problem. The Football League would probably love to have him, too. The issue isn’t that Greaves is short of invitations. He’s just not that into it. Jimmy Greaves was a great player, and doesn't need a fuss around him when he decides not to attend games . This can happen when you’re 75. Jimmy thinks of Wembley and, as much as the match — which he would enjoy — he imagines the queues of traffic on the North Circular, the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick-off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of Liverpool and Manchester City and then the rugby. Jim loves the rugby. Truth be told, if Ireland versus England captured his attention, he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over. He finds it strange that people are still interested in getting him to Wembley. We want our heroes to behave like besotted fans, but Jim’s interests were always broader. Greaves' interests were always broader than just football, and he should be left to enjoy his retirement . He liked playing, and was quite brilliant at it, but since retiring he’s as likely to be engrossed in a Test match as a cup final, and he hasn’t the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes. He doesn’t claim to be an expert on the modern game, having not been a part of it for so long, but feels no animosity towards the Premier League or its high-earning players. For a man whose problems with alcohol led him to a psychiatric unit shortly after retirement, the second act of Jim’s life has been a triumph. We should perhaps acknowledge this, rather than wonder why he isn’t constantly seeking attention or another lap of honour. We should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of Jimmy Greaves. Greaves doesn't claim to be an expert about the modern game, and didn't want to attend the League Cup fianl .	Spurs and Chelsea legend Jimmy Greaves chose not to go to Wembley . Greaves said he would rather watch the rugby than his former clubs . The ex-England striker should not have his decision challenged . As a former great Greaves has the right to a quiet retirement .

(CNN)The governor of Virginia has ordered an investigation after a black student at the University of Virginia was injured during an arrest early Wednesday. The university's Black Student Alliance distributed a photograph, showing what it said was Martese Johnson, 20, during his arrest. Blood splatters his shirt and covers his face. Video from the incident shows Johnson pinned to the ground, screaming: "I go to UVA! ... You f****** racists! What the f***? How did this happen?" An officer can be heard telling the student to stop fighting. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students rallied in support of Johnson. And Johnson himself took the microphone. "Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects ... please respect everyone here," he said. "We are one community. We deserve to respect each other, especially in times like this." Earlier, the Black Student Alliance issued a statement denouncing the incident. "Today, we are reminded of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice; as University students, we are not impervious to the brutality that has reeled on news cycles around the country," the group said. "We have marched and shouted that we are Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, but the proximity of this morning's brutality to a member of our community has deepened that wound. It is no longer happening only on national television -- it is a reality here and now at the University of Virginia that we must face as a collective," it said. People are also speaking out on Twitter where #JusticeForMartese was trending Wednesday evening. The student's name had 16,000 mentions on Twitter in the past 24 hours. According to the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), uniformed ABC special agents arrested Johnson after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment and questioned. He was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice, ABC said in a statement, adding that Johnson was treated for his injuries at a local hospital and released. In a separate statement, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said that he has asked the Secretary of Public Safety to open an independent Virginia State Police investigation into the use of force. The special agents involved in the incident will be restricted to administrative duties, pending the results of the investigation. Johnson is a third-year student double majoring in Italian and media studies. He has no criminal record, according to his attorney, and holds a variety of leadership positions on campus. "As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future," attorney Daniel P. Watkins said. "I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously." The president of the University of Virginia urged anyone who witnessed the arrest, or who has information about it, to contact authorities.

(CNN)Confucius said: "Study the past if you would define the future." In Iraq, the past is glorious and long. This is where the world's first cities were built and where writing and organized government were first developed more than 5,000 years ago. This is the land that gave the world its first great literary work -- the Epic of Gilgamesh, king of the city of Uruk -- over 1,000 years before Homer, and over 2,000 years before Christ. ISIS, like so many iconoclastic extremist groups through history, seeks to destroy the record of the past. In the past week, video has circulated showing neatly dressed figures wielding rather new-looking sledgehammers and destroying archaeological objects in the Mosul Museum. The spectacle would be ridiculous and pathetic if it were not so tragic. Although there are suggestions that some objects destroyed are only copies, many are said to be unique and irreplaceable objects that had survived thousands of years -- until now. ISIS has been busy trying to damage the famed Nergal Gate entry to the ancient city of Nineveh -- a city with a history reaching back thousands of years -- and most recently it is reportedly bulldozing the site of Nimrud, capital of the 9th-century B.C. Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II, and source of the famed Nimrud ivories. These ivories were first cleaned by none other than Agatha Christie while accompanying her archaeologist husband, Max Mallowan, during his excavation. All attacks on archaeological sites and artifacts are brutal assaults on our collective human memory. They deprive us of the evidence of human endeavors and achievements. The destruction eloquently speaks of the human folly and senseless violence that drives ISIS. The terror group is destroying the evidence of the great history of Iraq; it has to, as this history attests to a rich alternative to its barbaric nihilism. Worse, these acts of destruction supposedly in the name of religion are dishonest and hypocritical: the same ISIS also is busy looting archaeological sites to support its thriving illegal trade in antiquities, causing further incalculable harm. The smashed artifacts of the Mosul Museum and the destruction at Nineveh and Nimrud speak to a wider ignorance of archaeology and the meaning of the artifacts that archaeologists recover, study and preserve. These objects are the material record of humanity. They are not just for scholars, they are for everyone. They are the text of the past that helps define our future. Archaeologists clearly need to do more to expand a global understanding of, and appreciation for, the heritage of the past. But it is not just a question for teachers, professors and museum curators; there needs to be much greater awareness and protection of the past across society, in Iraq, in the United States and around the world, from the government to the public. We need more archaeology education globally; in Iraq and in other ISIS-affected countries, but also among people everywhere in order to help communities -- from children on up -- understand the fragility of the archaeological record and its critical importance to understanding the human story. Ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq, is at the heart of the human story: home of the first cities, states and empires. The law Code of Hammurabi, king of Babylon over 3,700 years ago, is the first great legal text of the world; it begins a heritage leading to Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights. The heritage of Iraq is our heritage, too. What can we do in response to this assault on our heritage? Providing educational opportunities and empowering communities to learn more about their cultures and histories, and those of others, is one of the best ways to eradicate destructive hatred and violence.	Sturt Manning: Video shows ISIS destroying apparent antiquities; they reflect rich history that is alternative to group's barbaric nihilism . He says it's key to teach importance of archaeology everywhere in world. Antiquities are the text of the past that helps define our future.
Lizzie Velasquez, pictured with documentary director Sara Hirsh Bordo arrive, at the premiere of 'A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story' today . Lizzie Velasquez has known the torment of being mocked by bullies from around the world. As a 17-year-old surfing the web, she came across a video of herself on YouTube that described her as the 'world's ugliest woman'. The devastated teenager spent days shutting herself from the world behind a wall of tears, thinking her life was over. But now 26, the inspirational woman has hit back at the trolls with an anti-bullying documentary about her life, describing her battle with a rare condition which stops her putting on weight. 'A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story' premiers at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, today. The 78-minute film charts Lizzie's inspiring path from cyber-bullying victim to anti-bullying activist. Featuring details of Lizzie's emotional and physical journey through the years, it follows her progress as she attempts to lobby the US government for the first federal anti-bullying Bill. She was born with Marfan syndrome and lipodystrophy, which is a problem with the way fat is distributed in the body. At only 5ft 2ins tall, Lizzie only weighs 58lbs - just over four stone. 'All we had known all my life was that I had a syndrome which meant that I couldn't gain weight. 'At the time, I thought everyone looked like me. I didn't recognise or tell that they didn't look like me.' Lizzie, born with a rare condition which prevents her from gaining weight, was tormented by bullies at school but was shocked to discover thousands of cruel comments on a YouTube video of her at the age of 17 . First bullied as a child in school for looking different, she was horrified to stumble across a YouTube video labeling her 'The World's Ugliest Woman' as a teenager. The video, viewed four million times, was accompanied by a cascade of cruel comments about her appearance - and suggestions that she should have killed at birth. 'It was afternoon. I decided to go look for music on YouTube - and that's when I found it,' she said. 'I don't even know why I clicked on it but I did and that's when I lost it. Speaking ahead of her documentary's showing today, Lizzie said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you' 'Calling me a monster or asking why my parents didn't abort me... how in the world can I forgive the people who told me to kill myself?' She fought back by giving a TED Talk in 2013 which she says 'changed everything'. 'This is my purpose. This is what I'm meant to do for the rest of my life. 'I like to think that I'm not only telling my story, I'm telling everyone's story.' Now, Lizzie's own YouTube channel, which boasts more than 300,000 subscribers. Speaking in a video posted to her channel ahead of her documentary's showing today, she said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you. 'I finally was able to sleep and I'm feeling rested and ready to go.' But the inspiring 26-year-old fought back by becoming a motivational speaker and anti-bullying activist . Director Sara Hirsh Bordo said: 'Bullying is a subject that historically yields heartbreaking stories of hopelessness and in many times, loss. 'Rarely is there a story of survival and inspiration that continues to crossover ages, genders, and ethnicities… enter the brave story of Lizzie Velasquez.' The pair met when Ms Bordo asked her to give the TED Talk, which attracted more than 10million viewers. 'She was a local hero whose time, we found out shortly after, had arrived,' she added. 'We live in a culture of tremendous meanness. And few people have experienced it more than Lizzie. 'Lizzie chose to not give up, but to forgive and to thrive; as an author, as a speaker, and now as an activist.' She added: 'What I wanted to show is that this is Lizzie’s film, but it is everyone’s story.' Marfan Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue, which hold the body’s cells and organs together. Connective tissue also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Marfan affects about one in 5,000 people - and can affect men and women of all races and ethnic groups. Three-quarters of those who have it inherit it - and there is a 50% chance that someone with Marfan syndrome will pass along the genetic mutation each time they have a child. But some are the first in their family to have it, which is called spontaneous mutation when it happens. People with Marfan syndrome are born with it, but features of the disorder are not always present immediately. Some features of Marfan syndrome, including those affecting the heart and blood vessels, bones or joints, can get worse over time. This means it is important for early diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid the risk for potentially life-threatening complications. Source: Marfan Foundation .

American Airlines has refunded a family's ticket for their daughter who died after a public outcry following their initial refusal to do so. Madison 'Scout' Cantrell, 9, died tragically from an asthma attack that led to cardiac arrest five months ago, sending her family into deep and sudden grief. The Cantrells,from St Charles, a suburb of Chicago, had been planning a trip to Bald Head, North Carolina this month, but decided to call it off. Scout's sister Katie, 13, said going to their traditional family vacation spot would be too emotionally painful. American Airlines refused to offer a refund for Scout's seat, transfer the ticket to someone else or issue a voucher. Scroll down for video . American Airlines originally refused to refund the ticket of Madison 'Scout' Cantrell, 9, who died in October after an asthma attack led to cardiac arrest . Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, applied for a refund and sent in a death certificate but was told that the documents did not 'meet exception requirements' The airline's website says that a travel vouches are given to family members of passengers who die before their flight. Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, said on Facebook that she had sent in the required documentation and death certificate, but posted a letter  from the company denying her request for a refund. The callous letter said 'the request does not meet our exception requirements' and that the fee for changing the flight would be waived 'as a one-time courtesy.' 'I know that I would never write this to someone. I don't know how someone could send this to another family,' Katie Cantrell told NBC Chicago. Katie Cantrell (right) said that going to her families normal vacation spot in North Carolina would be too emotionally painful without her sister Scout (left) Senior management from American Airlines got in contact with Felicity Cantrell on Wednesday night, and the family finally got their refund after a 'genuine' conversation . Social media users shared the mother's tragedy and American Airlines' corporate team got in touch with her, saying that she had gotten a refund when they actually hadn't. The customer service representatives that first contacted the family 'further exacerbated how American has treated us,' Mrs Cantrell said. On Wednesday night senior management from the company called and gave the Cantrells their refund. 'Were they doing corporate damage control? Yes, absolutely' Mrs Cantrell said. However, she added that her conversation with the manager was genuine and that he was 'thoroughly embarrassed and horrified by this whole situation'. The American Airlines representative also said that changes would be made in corporate training so  that employees will 'reflect empathy'. Mrs Cantrell posted on Facebook that the family would be vacationing in South Carolina this year. Social media users became outraged after hearing about the airline's callous response to the Cantrells.

Two thieves were part of a 'prolific and dangerous' organised gang that armed themselves with machetes and meat cleavers to intimidate people and steal jewellery, cars and cash. Jack Hunter, 20, and Jamie Ellis, 24 were part of the organised group that terrorised people in Liverpool to steal cars, wallets and handbags and committed a number of cash in transit robberies. Hunter took photos of bundles of cash the gang had stolen as well as pictures of himself, posing menacingly with a machete. He was jailed for his role in several burglaries, including one involving a pregnant woman. Jack Hunter was part of a gang of armed raiders that equipped themselves with machetes and knives to steal jewellery, cars and cash. Hunter posted pictures of their spoils as well as him posing with one of the weapons . The pair were caught after boastful and brazen images of their spoils were sent to a gang member who was serving time in prison, where they were intercepted by prison staff and handed to police. The gang are believed to have targeted members of the Chinese community involved with restaurants because they believed they may have taken their takings home with them. This left a number of Chinese people in Merseyside living in fear of being attacked. Hunter, of Anfield, stole a number of cars from the Merseyside area including a VW Passatt, a VW Golf and a Jaguar XFS. He was also part of a four-strong gang armed with knives and a meat cleaver who stole cash, wallets and handbags from the occupants of a house in Allerton, Liverpool. Hunter took a number of intimidating pictures of himself when he had been involved in the robberies . In one picture the gang show off their weapons and tools, as well as part of the car they had stolen . Hunter was jailed for 16 years after previously being convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. Ellis, of Roby, took part in cash in transit robberies at the Showcase cinema on East Lancashire Road on November 25, 2013, and a McDonald's restaurant on Edge Lane on December 4, 2013. He was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit cash in transit robberies. Ellis received another 12 months each for three counts of handling stolen goods, to run concurrently, and a further 15 months in prison in relation to the breach of a previous suspended sentence. Jamie Ellis (left) was sentenced to seven years in prison for the cash in transit thefts, while Jack Hunter (right) was jailed for 16 years for his role in the gang that robbed people while armed with knives . DCI Tom Keaton of Merseyside Police said: 'Jack Hunter and Jamie Ellis were part of a prolific and dangerous organised crime group which carried out a string of burglaries, car thefts and cash in transit robberies. 'During November through to the early part of February, Hunter was part of a group responsible for a string of domestic burglaries both in Merseyside and Worcestershire, in which high value cars were often targeted. 'Hunter's criminality culminated in a robbery and an aggravated burglary in south Liverpool in which members of the Chinese community were targeted. 'The offenders armed themselves with a range of weapons, including knives, machetes and an axe, and didn't hesitate to subject their victims to truly horrific ordeals in which they were intimidated and threatened though thankfully not physically injured. Pictures of bundles of cash stolen from people targeted by the prolific gang were taken . 'During one of these incidents, the gang threatened the occupants of a house, then forced a pregnant woman, her baby daughter and two elderly female relatives into the living room where they stole jewellery.' The gang committed 12 burglaries in Merseyside and Worcester, three cash in transit robberies, two motor vehicle thefts and two offences of handling stolen goods. The offences took place between November 2013 and February 2014. DCI Tom Keaton said they worked with members of the Chinese community across Merseyside to bring the offenders to justice. He added: 'Some of the pictures we have released show Jack Hunter appearing to glorify the use of weapons and showing delight in the results of the group's criminality. 'I'm convinced Merseyside is now a far safer place as these two offenders will be off the streets for a significant period of time.' Members also took pictures of the watches and expensive jewellery that had stolen from people's homes . Designer handbags also formed part of the gangs spoils as they targeted homes and committed cash in transit robberies and thefts . Craig Lister, Daniel Challinor and Marlene Currie pleaded guilty to various offences at a previous hearing in relation to the conspiracies and will be sentenced at a later date. Head of community engagement, Chief Supt Rowley Moore, said: 'The offences against Chinese nationals living in Merseyside brought fear to what is a tight knit and very proud group of people. 'I'd like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to their bravery and recognise the contribution the victims have made in providing evidence and securing these court results. 'We provided support throughout the justice process and also worked closely with senior members of those communities and a range of partners to provide reassurance and advice'	Jack Hunter and Jamie Ellis were part of a 'prolific' crime gang in Liverpool .

TSA agents allowed a convicted felon and former member of a domestic terrorist group to pass through an expedited security line, Homeland Security's internal watchdog has revealed. The passenger, whose identity has not been released, has served years in prison for murder and offenses involving explosives, the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office said as it revealed the 'significant aviation security breach' in a statement on Thursday night. The watchdog was asked to investigate the June 2014 incident last October after a whistleblower came forward. It did not release specific details of the passenger's criminal history or where the incident took place. The passenger, who is a U.S. citizen, had not registered for the TSA's PreCheck program, but if they had, they would have been rejected because of their convictions, the office said in the statement. 'Significant security breach': A passenger who has convictions for murder and offenses involving explosives was allowed to pass through the TSA's PreCheck line (file picture) despite an agent recognizing them . Instead, they were selected for the screening through the Secure Flight program's 'risk assessment rules', the watchdog said. The program compares information the traveler has given their airline with information from the Terrorist Screening Database, No Fly lists and other intelligence-based systems to determine if they can board the plane and to identify low-risk passengers for expedited screening. After determining a passenger can be pre-screened, it allows them to print documents carrying the PreCheck sign. The TSA was unable to show the traveler's vetting results because they are deleted seven days after travel, the Inspector General's Office said. When the passenger reached the airport, an agent looked at their documents. 'After checking the traveler's boarding pass and identification, an alert Transportation Security officer at the airport recognized the felon and alerted his supervisor,' the watchdog said, CNN reported. 'However, the supervisor directed the [officer] to take no action and allow the traveler to continue through the TSA pre-check lane.' As part of the PreCheck system, the passenger - who has a criminal history involving explosives - would not have had to take off their shoes or jackets or remove liquids from their carry-on luggage. Investigation: The TSA responded that all passengers, including those with PreCheck tickets, are subject to 'robust' checks. It is not known where the June 2014 breach took place . The incident was brought to the attention of the Inspector General's Office's after a whistleblower went to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative agency. A classified report was issued to TSA detailing the need to make changes to the PreCheck vetting and screening process. On Thursday, the TSA said in a statement that it 'takes its responsibility for protecting the traveling public very seriously'. 'All passengers, including those with TSA PreCheck on boarding passes, are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen,' it said. The TSA added that the success of its pre-screening system relies on the intelligence and national law enforcement communities identifying passengers they believe to pose a risk - yet this passenger had not been place on one of their lists. Still, the agency said it was reviewing the guidelines it provides to TSA officers and supervisors to ensure they 'clearly understand the procedure in the event a person or item presents a creditable threat to transportation security'.	The unidentified passenger had convictions for murder and offenses related to explosives, said Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office . Despite this, the traveler was issued a ticket allowing them to take the PreCheck lane . A TSA agent recognized the felon and told their supervisor - but the supervisor allowed the passenger to go through anyway . PreCheck means passengers can keep on their jackets, do not need to remove shoes and do not need to take liquids out of their luggage . The watchdog, which began investigating in October after a whistleblower came forward, did not say where the June 2014 incident took place . TSA said it takes its responsibility to protect the public 'very seriously'
Scientists believe they have got to the bottom of anal evolution. A team of Norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully-functioning anus, while other only have 'transient' ones. The study also reveals how some creatures, such as the Penis worm, have very similar digestive systems to humans, even though they are very different species. Scroll down for video . The latest study builds on earlier research which looked at the genes expressed during the development of intestines, stomach and anus in the Penis worm, pictured . Biologist Dr Andreas Hejnol and Dr Chema Martín-Durán, of the University of Bergen, spent several years studying how genes change the development of creatures. 'While several organ systems have been investigated, such as the nervous system, the anal opening has been largely neglected,' Dr Hejnol told BBC Earth. The study, published in the journal Zoologischer Anzeiger, identified genes known as brachyury and ParaHox, that are crucial to the development of an anus. According to a report by Matt Walker at the BBC, their study reveals how the anus is perhaps one of the most important organs in our body, helping our digestive system work. He notes that, interestingly, not all animals have one. Some animals have simpler versions, in others the organ appears to be transient, while another has multifunctional anuses. Animals that do have an anus, however, often grow to be larger, more sophisticated creatures. A team of Norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully-functioning anus, while other only have 'transient' ones . In 2013, researchers discovered that one of our earliest ancestors was a worm with no anus. The worm, named Xenoturbella bocki, has no brain, no sex organs and no vital organs. The 1m worm is regarded by some scientists as a key biological link between many species. Researchers believe the worm is a distant progenitor of humans and a host of other animals living today. Swedish researchers say the worm might belong to a branch of the animal family tree called deuterostomes, of which humans are also members. Trying to understand when and why the anus evolved is also complicated because it also appears and vanishes again within various groups of animals, such as flatworms. The latest study builds on earlier research which looked at the genes expressed during the development of intestines, stomach and anus in the Penis worm. What surprised the researchers was not just that the development was the same in the worms as in humans, fish and frogs, but that exactly the same genes were involved in the process. Penis worms live in shallow parts of the oceans, including off the Swedish west coast where they propagate during the winter. 'This means that the origin of the human stomach is further back in time than previously thought, probably about 500 million years', says Ralf Janssen, postdoc in professor Graham Budd's research group on paleobiology at Uppsala University. The team are now conducting further research into whether the anus has evolved independently a number of times among animals. 'The pattern of presence and absence of the anus in animals is quite fascinating,' Dr Hejnol told the BBC.	Brachyury and ParaHox genes could shed light on anus evolution . They may indicate why some creatures only have a 'transient' anus . Study also reveals how some creatures have very similar digestive systems to humans, even though they are very different species .
An NHS trust accused of making a woman infertile after a botched appendix operation is  trying to cut compensation for the mistake because they say she would not have been earning as much if she'd had a baby. Sarah Marquis claims she was 'rendered infertile' by doctors at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London, after her appendix burst in 2008. The 41-year-old lawyer is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for £1.5million in the belief that it is to blame for her infertility. Sarah Marquis, 41, is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust after a botched operation left her infertile . But while the trust admits causing her injuries, it claims it does not owe her so much money in compensation as if she had been able to give birth she would not be earning as much. Instead it believes she is entitled to £300,000, with lawyers acting on its behalf telling the High Court that Ms Marquis's career would have been hampered if she'd ever given birth. The Court heard how the woman was admitted to hospital in 2008 after complaining of abdominal pains at her GP. She was treated with painkillers for three days before surgeons decided to remove the inflamed organ. But by the time they got round to operating, Ms Marquis's appendix had burst and an abdominal infection had set in. As a result she lost her ability to have children naturally. Describing the hospital's role in her ordeal, Ms Marquis's counsel Cara Guthrie said: 'Had it not been for the negligence of the defendants, Ms Marquis’ appendix would not have perforated. 'She would have made a rapid and uncomplicated recovery, avoiding an extended hospital stay, and she would not have been rendered infertile.' As a result of the botched operation Ms Marquis had to take time off from her £85,000 a year job and missed out on promotions abroad, she added. While the Trust's barrister admitted it was to blame for the complications, he denied her claim that she was entitled to £1.5million. The 41-year-old lawyer was treated at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London, )pictured above) in 2008 . Lawyers acting on behalf of the trust said Ms Marquis, who is also a Labour councillor, would not have been earning as much money if she had a baby. The hearing at the High Court (above) continues . He argued that rather than move up the career ladder her earnings would have slowed down as a result of giving birth. 'The Trust acknowledges the fault on its part that caused your injuries and it is sorry for that,' said Bradley Martin. '(But) the possibilities are that you would have got pregnant naturally in the six months you and your partner decided to really try for a baby after the negligence. Speaking of her long term partner who she began living with shortly after the surgery he added: 'You moved in together in order to have a baby.' He rejected her earlier claim that had it not been for the operation she would have been selected to work in the company's American offices as he said she would have been pregnant. Ms Marquis rejected his accusations. The 41-year-old had undergone IVF treatment in the past to become pregnant. 'If that was my only time to have a child then I would have done so...(but) I do value my career at the same time. 'I wanted to get my life back to normal. I had been off work effectively for three and a half years.' The hearing continues.	Sarah Marquis was left unable to have children following botched surgery .

A patient recovering from surgery no doubt feels much better after winning $7 million after his father tucked a lottery ticket into his get-well card. Joseph Amorese, of Easton, Pennsylvania received the ticket from his father, who lives in the hamlet of Congers in Rockland County, New York as he recovered from hernia surgery. A few scratches later on the '$7 million Golden Ticket' and he was feeling great. 'I scratched the ticket and it was a good thing I was already sitting down because I was shocked. I was - and still am - in complete disbelief,' Amorese said at a check presentation on Wednesday. Joy: Joseph Amorese, center, and his wife Jodi, right, were presented with a ceremonial check by the New York Lottery on Wednesday after Amorese won $7 million on a scratch card - a gift from his father . Shock: Amorese, who was recovering from surgery when he scratched off the card, said he wanted to jump up and down with excitement but couldn't. 'In my mind I was jumping up and down,' he said . 'I had surgery so I didn't jump up and down, but in my mind I was jumping up and down.' He sent a photo of the ticket to his father, whom he called 'a retired hospital administrator-turned-avid Lottery player', who agreed that it was a winner. The 46-year-old senior project manager for Verizon then called his wife Jodi, a social worker. When he said, 'Honey, I think we won $7 million,' he was met by a long, stunned silence, he said. 'She was too stunned to talk,' he said. His 'avid Lottery player' father bought the ticket for him from Just A Dollar in New City, New York . Lottery officials presented Amorese with a ceremonial check at the Just A Dollar store store in New City, New York, where the ticket was purchased. A CBS reporter asked if it healed the hernia any faster and Amorese laughed and responded: 'All the pain I felt, I did not feel for at least a couple of days.' The couple collected a lump sum of $4.5 million and said they plan to keep their jobs. The chances of hitting the jackpot are just one in 3,708,000.

(CNN)If Azealia Banks is asked to leave the United States, that will probably be OK with her. "I hate everything about this country," the rapper told Playboy interviewer Rob Tannenbaum. "Like, I hate fat white Americans. All the people who are crunched into the middle of America, the real fat and meat of America, are these racist conservative white people who live on their farms. Those little teenage girls who work at Kmart and have a racist grandma -- that's really America." Those comments were preceded by remarks about race and racism, topics she frequently addresses on her no-holds-barred Twitter feed. "It's always about race. Lorde can run her mouth and talk sh*t about all these other b***hes, but y'all aren't saying she's angry. If I have something to say, I get pushed into the corner," she said. "Really, the generational effects of Jim Crow and poverty linger on. As long as I have my money, I'm getting the f**k out of here and I'm gonna leave y'all to your own devices." Her comments weren't limited to issues. Banks also lashed out at fellow artists Pharrell, Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. "In American society, the game is to be a nonthreatening black person," she said. "That's why you have Pharrell or Kendrick Lamar saying, 'How can we expect people to respect us if we don't respect ourselves?' He's playing that nonthreatening black man sh*t, and that gets all the white soccer moms going, 'We love him.' "Even Kanye West plays a little bit of that game," she added. She did approve of Jay Z, noting that "hasn't played any of those games." The interview appears in Playboy's April issue.

Sebastian Vettel has knocked back an invitation from Nico Rosberg to visit the Mercedes garage this weekend, fearing a PR stunt. Ferrari star Vettel and Mercedes ace Nico Rosberg became involved in a spat during the post-Australian Grand Prix press conference. It resulted in Vettel suggesting Mercedes should open up their garage at the Sepang International Circuit for an inspection of their cars in the wake of a dominant display at Melbourne's Albert Park. Sebastian Vettel, speaking ahead of the Malaysian Grand Prix, has snubbed an invite from Nico Rosberg . Vettel branded Rosberg's invitation to visit the Mercedes garage in Malaysia as 'staged' and a 'PR stunt' Rosberg then invited Vettel, with the latter suggesting the debrief in the engineers' room for his visit. Now, however, such a plan has been knocked down as Vettel said: 'When I was joking with Nico in the press conference the deal was the invite was for all the paddock. Now it seems the invite has shrunk to just me. 'Initially I think it was called off by Niki (Lauda, Mercedes non-executive director) and Toto (Wolff, Mercedes motorsport boss). Rosberg finished second behind race-winner Lewis Hamilton at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . 'Now they've told (Rosberg) yes, so I think they are using it as a bit more of a PR thing rather than a proper invite, so the answer is no I won't be going.' Asked as to whether it was his decision or that of Ferrari, he said: 'It wasn't really discussed to be honest. 'Initially it was called off and then I think they tried to use it as "Ah yeah, we are so friendly and open to everyone". 'Even if I went there, do you think they would really open up? That means I won't go, because even if I go it's all staged.'	Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg involved in spat after Australian GP .

A natural reaction for a mother is to want to alleviate their child's pain but just two doses of a mainstream painkiller saw a seven month old baby almost lose her short life. Jen Shaw, from Toowoomba, about 120km west of Brisbane in Queensland, is no stranger to motherhood, having had six children in 13 years. However, nothing could have prepared her for the emotions she experienced over her youngest child in the past few weeks. What started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little Chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning, swelling and blistering so much that she became unidentifiable to her mother. Scroll down for video . Jen Shaw (left) with her daughter Chasley (right) who had a dangerous reaction to taking two doses of Nurofen . What started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little Chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning, swelling and blistering . Chasely was checked over by a GP on Monday February 25 and confirmed Ms Shaw's suspicions that her daughter was just suffering from a cold: 'a mild cough, a runny nose and a case of “baby grumpys” but otherwise fine.' Ms Shaw, a whole food chef who blogs on health and wellbeing, gave Chasely two doses of Nurofen on Tuesday February 26 as she was miserable after battling the head cold for the past week. This was the first time that the seven-month-old had ever taken any medication before but Ms Shaw thought nothing of it as all of her other five children had taken Nurofen in the past. 'She seemed a bit better after the first dose and seemed a bit more content but after the second dose she was very cranky and irritable,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not what you would expect from a child who has just been given pain relief.' Ms Shaw immediately had a gut feeling that her little girl has reacted to the medication and read the back of the bottle for potential side effects. 'I remember scouring the Nurofen bottle for a list of symptoms that might signal an allergic reaction, but couldn't find much at all,' she said. 'If I can tell you one thing that has become solidified from this whole experience it is trusting your mama gut.' The nasty blister on her ear (left) and her precious skin shedding off all over her body (right) The seven-month old became unidentifiable to her own mother who was told by doctors to expect the worst . Casely needed to be given the powerful painkiller Endone to ease her excruciating pain . After a very restless night with her unhappy little one - Ms Shaw knew they had to go to the hospital. 'She was waking up every 15 minutes squealing in pain, fists clenched, balling over and clamping down every time I would try to feed her,' 'By the time we got to the emergency room she had a red ring around her eyes, nose and mouth, her neck also was red and had what I thought was bad nappy rash.' After several tests including an ultrasound they were sent home with a diagnosis of a viral infection. But the next morning, Chasely had several nasty blisters on her face and neck, and a very painful one on her ear which was weeping, her nappy rash had become even worse and she had become pale and very ill. They went back to the hospital, where anxieties were even further heightened when the doctors had no idea what was wrong with poor Chasely. 'The day in emergency was quite scary, I remember reading the faces of the staff and seeing worry, but more than anything seeing confusion,' she said. 'A kind of look that they had no idea what was going on with my baby girl.' 'I hugged her, I whispered in her ear that I needed her to fight on,' Ms Shaw said to her sick little girl . Finally a specialist paediatric doctor suggested it may have been an extremely rare condition called Steven Johnson’s syndrome - a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction. 'Doctors came from all around that afternoon to see Chasely and her skin, it terrified me that all these doctors had never seen anything like it before,' she said. 'I mean how could they fix her if they didn't even know what it was?' Chasely was treated with a high dose antibiotics and Panadol for her excruciating pain. 'Through Thursday night she was checked almost hourly, her entire skin was red and hot, she was in such agony and squealed in so much pain. 'She wouldn't sleep away from my arms and even the slightest movement could hurt her.' When Ms Shaw woke on Friday morning, she said she couldn't even recognise her own baby. 'A doctor told me to prepare for the worst, that my baby girl was extremely sick and extremely fragile. 'My heart completely shattered - I thought we would lose her.' It was at this point that Ms Shaw broke down unable to comprehend a life without her  beautiful little girl. 'Once I got baby Chasely to sleep, I escaped to the bathroom and sobbed,' she said. 'I didn't know how to fix this, what do I do next? I could only give myself over to the hospital, and to a higher power.' But Ms Shaw decided they were not giving up without a fight. 'I returned and I hugged her, I whispered in her ear that I needed her to fight on, just fight this off and we will go home. I gave her all my energy and all my love,' she said. Ms Shaw cried when she saw Chasely catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing . By Monday Chasely's fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself . Numbing gel was used in Chasely's mouth so she could continue feeding and breast milk was used on her wounds along with lukewarm baths with paraffin and later with paw paw. The pain was so bad that she had to be given Endone which Ms Shaw said was extremely frightening as it's such a heavy duty pain killer but knew she had no choice. Finally, by Saturday afternoon, Chasely started to improve - she was able lay on a bed and look around. 'My sister and eldest daughter came to visit and danced for her with toys, and though she couldn't smile and laugh I could see she was amused,' she said. The following day,  her swelling started to go down and parts of her body that had blistered first started to heal and Ms Shaw began to recognise her little girl again. By Monday her fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself. 'I cried when I saw her catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing.' Chasely was released from hospital on Tuesday where her skin could be treated at home. Almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed Chasely of her young life, you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl. 'We are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters.' Almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed Chasely of her young life, you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl . She doesn't know how she could have gone on if Chasely didn't courageously bounce back from such a debilitating state. 'I'm not sure I would have coped very well - I can't imagine going through what some parents have,' she said. Chasely must now avoid all steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Ms Shaw says that they still have a long journey ahead to learn more about her daughter's condition. But she insists she feels no animosity towards Nurofen. 'I'm not waging a war on pharmaceutical companies - I just want to educate and empower people on what can happen,' she said. 'But there is a list of 300 different medications, antibiotics and even vitamins that she can never have so there a lot more to learn on our journey.' 'Nurofen is very sorry to hear about Chasely Shaw’s condition and are glad to hear she is recovering. We take the health of our customers very seriously. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is an extremely rare but known reaction to a multitude of triggers such as infections, medications or illness. The exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable . Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), a group of medicines that includes ibuprofen, have also been associated with rare cases of SJS, there is no confirmed causal link . Allergic skin reactions of this type are extremely rare. Based on our adverse event collection data, the incidence of SJS is 1 case per 100 million packs sold. All Nurofen for Children packs include warnings for consumers to stop taking and see a healthcare professional immediately if an allergic reaction occurs.'
