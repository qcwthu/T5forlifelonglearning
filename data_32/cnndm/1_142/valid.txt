The Prime Minister led furious calls for any companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent to face the toughest consequences . Rogue data firms were warned by David Cameron last night that they could face serious penalties after the Mail exposed an astonishing trade in private information. The Prime Minister led furious calls for any companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent to face the toughest consequences. He suggested the law would be tightened if loopholes are being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers. His comments came as charities for the elderly, politicians and campaigners called for an urgent crackdown and said there should be lengthy jail sentences for the worst offenders. The Information Commissioner said data firms could face fines of £500,000 and warned that those breaking the law ‘are in deep trouble’. The Mail revealed yesterday how highly sensitive financial information about millions of pension holders is being sold for as little as 5p and ending up in the hands of criminals. The revelations come amid fears scammers are targeting the elderly and vulnerable ahead of George Osborne’s pension reforms, which come into force on Monday and will give savers the chance to access their full retirement pots. Data firms sold undercover reporters personal data for 15,000 people, including their salaries, the value of their investments and the size of their pensions. They did so without any attempt to verify that the reporters, who posed as a cold-calling firm, were a genuine company or to check how they planned to use the data. Last night, Mr Cameron said the revelations were ‘very worrying’. He told the Mail: ‘I’ve listened to the Information Commissioner who now has the powers and laws that he needs to chase after this stuff. But it’s extremely serious. 'We’ll always look at it and if more needs to be done we’ll do it, but my understanding from the briefing that I have had is that the legal position is pretty robust. Data theft, information theft, there are quite serious penalties.’ Nick Clegg said large scale data theft should carry a jail term. The Deputy Prime Minister said he had pushed for tougher sentences. ‘The average fine for data theft is about £100’, he said. ‘Even if it’s on an industrial scale.’ Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘It is nothing short of disgraceful that personal details of vulnerable and older people are being bought and sold in this way. This has got to stop and the Government needs to act.’ And Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘Today’s revelations that personal data is being passed on to those looking to make a quick buck out of pensioners’ savings are shocking. How yesterday's Mail broke the story: Nick Sayer, a director of B2C Data, offered to sell details of 15,000 people to undercover reporters . 'Ministers have ignored warning after warning about the threats to savers from fraudsters, but they must now act quickly to protect savers.’ The Mail’s investigation into the sale of personal data prompted a wave of fury and concern from leading politicians, pensions experts, data experts and charities. Here is what they said: . David Cameron: ‘It’s extremely serious. We’ll always look at it and if more needs to be done we’ll do it, but.. data theft, information theft, there are quite serious penalties.’ Information Commissioner Christopher Graham: ‘What these companies appear to be failing to understand is that under the law you have rights over the use of your personal information. If they decide to treat it as their own product, to buy and sell without your permission, then there will be consequences.’ Andy Burnham, shadow health secretary: ‘It is nothing short of disgraceful that personal details of vulnerable and older people are being bought and sold in this way. This has got to stop.’ Ros Altmann, pensions expert: ‘It is utterly shocking and wrong. There now needs to be real change from the authorities. A zero tolerance policy for those who sell your private, personal or intimate details for their own profit and cause so much misery so carelessly and callously.’ Professor Sir Brian Jarman, NHS data expert: ‘People can get this confidential information and target those who are vulnerable. I’m very worried. The data is being used for one reason when it was given for another. There need to be harsh punishments.’ Lisa Harris, Saga spokeswoman: 'The findings of the Mail’s investigation are extremely worrying, and not just for the most vulnerable in society. Whilst many of us know not to give details over the phone, when the caller appears to have information about you that only you could have provided, it’s easy to see how people might think the call is genuine.’ Janet Morrison of charity Independent Age: ‘It is horrifying that older people are being deliberately targeted by those who have gained access to records on their pensions. They are clearly being seen as easy pickings.’ Nick Clegg: 'The average fine for data theft is about £100, even if it’s on an industrial scale. That’s why we wanted to introduce custodial sentences. Data theft is a big issue.’ The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has begun an inquiry as a result of the Mail investigation and is passing our evidence to police. Pensioners’ financial details appear to have been sold after being stolen, and as the result of firms keeping personal information when they should have deleted it. Information commissioner Christopher Graham said: ‘What these companies appear to be failing to understand is that under the law you have rights over the use of your personal information. If they decide to treat it as their own product, to buy and sell without your permission, then there will be consequences. 'This looks like a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act. If we establish it’s criminal activity by individuals, then they are in deep trouble.’ Pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann, an adviser to Mr Cameron, said: ‘It is utterly shocking and wrong. It seems this theft of our private and personal information is endemic in business today and needs to stop. ‘There now needs to be real change from the authorities. No more tolerance of such betrayals of trust –a zero tolerance policy for those who sell your private, personal or intimate details for their own profit and cause so much misery so carelessly and callously.’ Janet Morrison, chief executive of Independent Age, said: ‘It is horrifying that older people are being deliberately targeted by those who have gained access to records on their pensions. They are being targeted for their savings and pensions as well as by individuals specifically looking to exploit their vulnerabilities.’ Over-50s specialist firm Saga warned that the level of detail on sale about individuals made them more likely to fall victim to ‘despicable fraud’. Age UK said it was particularly troubled by the firm that offered the Mail’s team of ‘cold-callers’ undercover reporters £500 for every pensioner they could persuade to put £20,000 in high-risk investments. One of the firms named by the Mail, B2C Data Ltd, said it welcomes the ICO probe and will co-operate fully with any investigation. A spokesman accused the Mail of ‘numerous factual errors and exaggerations’. A statement added: ‘B2C Data Ltd is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office and is a member of the Direct Marketing Association. It operates an entirely legitimate and legally-compliant data business. ‘It complies with all its legal requirements. Importantly, it does not receive or process information other than in respect of those customers of its members who have opted in. Equally, it does not sell “highly sensitive details of... salaries, investments and pensions”. B2C Data takes its legal obligations very seriously and will continue to do so.’ By Katherine Faulkner Mail Investigations Editor . Controversial plans for a new NHS database face growing concerns following the Mail’s revelation that lists of people with medical problems are being touted for sale by unscrupulous data firms. Doctors have already expressed ‘grave doubts’ about the NHS plan – called care.data. Under the scheme, details from every patient’s GP medical file will be put on one huge database and shared with drug companies. Officials say the database will be kept secure and anonymous. But many doctors have expressed misgivings concerns about the project, with the NHS’s top data expert, Professor Sir Brian Jarman, saying last night he was still ‘very worried’ about it. Today the Mail reveals how lists of people with medical problems are being treated as potentially rich pickings for those looking to exploit the vulnerable. Those whose medical details had been sold on said that being on such a list meant they were constantly cold called – with some offered apparently unregulated treatments and medicines by unscrupulous firms. Critics are likely to feel that if such information was compiled on to one huge database, which was then shared with commercial companies such as drug manufacturers, the risk that it could be used by firms wanting to target the sick could be just too great. Sir Brian, a senior government health adviser, said: ‘This is the most confidential information you can have on patients. ‘Among these are very vulnerable people. That data should not be available.’ Many doctors already believe it would be impossible to ensure the detailed information on patients contained in their GP files – which often includes private and sensitive discussions between doctor and patient – would not identify them. Others have protested that the Government has a poor record on keeping peoples’ data secure and have criticised the move to opt all patients in to the scheme, without their explicit consent. Some analysts say they could identify individuals in under two hours from the information.	PM said companies selling personal data should face tough consequences . Charities called for an urgent crackdown and jail terms for worst offenders . Information Commissioner said data firms could face fines of £500,000 .

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared victory in Israel's election despite being tied with the opposition party in exit polls. Mr Netanyahu took to Twitter to declare a 'great victory' for his right-wing Likud party despite polls showing a dead heat with its main opponent, the centre-left Zionist Union. The Prime Minister wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for Likud, a great victory for the national camp led by Likud, a great victory for the people of Israel.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured) delivered a speech for supporters after declaring victory in Israel's election - which exit polls suggest are virtually neck and neck . The incumbent Prime Minister (left and right) took to Twitter to declare a 'great victory' for his right-wing Likud party, despite polls showing a dead heat with its main opponent, the centre-left Zionist Union . Netanyahu (left) took a moment to greet his wife Sara (right) on stage after reacting to the early exit polls . He wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the people of Israel!' But his main challenger later disputed Netanyahu's victory claim, saying 'everything is open'. Speaking to supporters at party headquarters in Tel Aviv, Herzog said: 'This result allows us to return to power. We will wait for the real results - everything is open.' He added that he would make 'every effort; to cobble together the next coalition government. Polls carried out by the country's three major TV stations have shown an extremely tight race between the Prime Minister's ruling Likud Party and opposition leader Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union. Two polls showed the parties deadlocked with 27 seats each, while a third gave Likud a slight lead of 28-27. But all showed the centrist newcomer Moshe Kahlon with enough seats to determine who will be the next prime minister. Kahlon, a Likud breakaway, has not said which side he would favour - but is likely to drive a hard bargain. They also seemed to suggest that Netanyahu appears to have the slight upper hand in forming a majority coalition, thanks to his traditional right-wing and religious allies. Israeli supporters of the centre-left Zionist Union party wave their national flag as they take part in early celebrations outside the party's headquarters. Exit polls show the two main parties are neck and neck . According to the polls, carried out by Israel's leading television channels, Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union is tied with the ruling Likud party.

It also appears Netanyahu has the slight upper hand in forming a coalition . The Netanyahu supporters cheered as they heard the first television predictions for the election results . 'This is a great victory. It's almost a miracle,' Likud lawmaker Ofir Akunis told The Associated Press. 'For months, everybody attacked the Likud. And today is a beautiful day for the Likud. It sends a message that the people of Israel will decide for themselves.' The early figures set off huge celebrations at the Likud campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv. But the mixed results are sure to disappoint Herzog, who had been tipped to come out on top in the election. The results will be announced on Wednesday morning but the country will already be headings into weeks of negotiations, in a bid to form a coalition. The parties will all fall short of the required 61-seat majority in parliament. The early results, which will be confirmed on Wednesday, triggered huge celebrations at the Likud party's campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv .

Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his campaign headquarters . Israel is divided between two major groups of voters - right wingers and religious parties that tend to take a hard line toward the Palestinians, and parties focused on establishing a Palestinian state as part of a peace agreement. The left wing appeared to have slightly more seats, but would rely heavily on a new Arab list that has said it will not sit in a coalition. That gives Netanyahu, who his seeking his third consecutive term, and his traditional right-wing allies a slight head-start in the negotiations. Experts agreed that the vote had largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu. Final opinion polls published late last week put Herzog ahead with 25-26 seats with Netanyahu's Likud taking 20-22. But they also warned about the reliability of the polls, pointing to the 2013 election when they completely failed to predict the level of support for centrist newcomer Yesh Atid.

Supporters of Moshe Kahlon's party Kulanu celebrate after the exit polls were announced. The party has enough seats to decide who will be the next prime minister - but is likely to drive a hard bargain . This election season has amplified the bitter divide between hard-liners and moderates in Israel. In an extraordinary attempt to sway right-wing voters, Netanyahu announced on the eve of the election that there would be no Palestinian state if he were re-elected. As his party trailed the Zionist Union in final opinion polls, Netanyahu said that if his rivals were elected security would be compromised and they would give up total Israeli control over Jerusalem. 'We will continue to build to fortify Jerusalem so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever,' he said on a tour of Har Homa, a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east Jerusalem. The outgoing Israeli parliament and the latest opinion poll . Netanyahu also vowed he would never allow the Palestinians to establish a capital in the city's eastern sector and pledged to build 'thousands' of settler homes. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as capital of their future state, and continued settlement building has incensed the international community, which sees it as an obstacle to peace. Throughout his campaign, Netanyahu has repeatedly accused Zionist Union leaders Isaac Herzog and former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni of being ready to abandon Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its indivisible capital. But Netanyahu's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was reelected. He later told public radio the two-state solution was now irrelevant, saying the 'reality has changed' and 'any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists'. Herzog, however, dismissed Netanyahu's jibes, pledging on Sunday  to 'safeguard' Jerusalem 'in actions, not just words, more than any other leader'. On Monday, he insisted Jerusalem would remain forever Israel's 'undivided capital'. The leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier -- as in 2009 when the centrist Kadima party then headed by Livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought Netanyahu to power for a second term. Under Israel's complex electoral system, the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes, but to the MP or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61.

A bust of Vladmir Putin, depicting the Russian leader dressed as a Roman emperor, is to be unveiled in St Petersburg. The Roman-style statue is being gifted by St.Petersburg’s fiercely nationalist Cossack community to commemorate the allies’ victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The comparison of the strongman with the leaders of ancient Rome was in-part inspired by Putin’s decision to back pro-Russian separatists in the Ukraine,Newsweek reported. The clay mould was designed by a St. Petersburg sculptor, backed by the city's popular Cossack community . The bust is at the St Petersburg's Academy of arts, ahead to its unveiling at an underground station . St Petersburg’s traditionalist Cossack group Irbis, a popular organisation supporting Slavic military values, said the bust of Putin will be placed at an underground station in north St Petersburg. The city, formally Leningrad, is Putin’s home town. The bust’s designer, sculptor Pavel Greshnikov, was quoted as saying he had considered portraying the Russian leader in a suit and tie, in military fatigues and even in medieval armour. The statue is complete with a laurel wreath and other trappings of the Roman Empire. It is at Greshinov’s workshop at the St Petersburg Academy of arts, ahead to its unveiling. Putin may have upset some people with his Ukrainian activities, but in his hometown he is still popular . Cossacks have grown in popularity in Russian since the fall of communism in the 80s and 90s. The group, which prides itself on military valour and its Russian Orthodox Christian roots, has particularly warmed to Putin’s increasingly traditional values. Andrey Polykov, a local Cossack leader in St Petersburg, backed the creation of the Putin Statue. Lenin was commemorated in bronze throughout the USSR. However in many places the statues were torn down after the fall of communism . He was quoted as saying the Russian leader was one of the country’s ‘brightest’ and most ‘positive’ heads of state for ‘the last hundred years or so’. Polykov claimed Putin had a record as a peacemaker following wars in Georgia in 2008 and Moldova in the early 1990s. Boris Yeltsin, Putin’s predecessor, has also been immortalised in sculpture. A statue of the post-Soviet leader was erected in Yekaterinburg in 2011. Andrey Polyakov said his Cossack community had been planning for a long time to erect the Putin statue .	Vladmir Putin to be shown in a laurel wreath and a wearing a Roman tunic . Cossacks chose the St Petersburg statue to mark victory against Nazis . Traditional group said the idea was inspired by Putin's stance on Ukraine . Sculptor said he considered putting Putin in a suit of armour or in fatigues .
Youngsters who get themselves Saturday jobs like Brooklyn Beckham or Jamie Oliver's kids may end up harming their grades, a report has found. While it may do celebrity children – like David and Victoria Beckham’s son, who grabbed a few weekend shifts at a coffee shop – the world of good to get some work experience, research suggests it could come at a cost to young people’s education. Celebrity chef Jamie recently revealed he intends to keep his daughters ‘real’ by having them work in his pub on the weekends. Youngsters who get themselves Saturday jobs may end up harming their grades, a report has found. Jamie Oliver (pictured with his wife and children) says he will encourage his kids to work in his pub on weekends . But a new study by the Institute for Social and Economic at the University of Essex found teenagers who take on part-time jobs experience a slip in their GCSE results. This is because earning extra cash makes it more likely for youngsters to spend it unwisely – including on alcohol, cigarettes and and cannabis. And the effect was found to be more drastic for girls. Despite having millionaires for parents, Brooklyn Beckham took on weekend shifts at a coffee shop . Results showed an extra hour of work per week in Year 10 saw their results drop around one grade in one subject the following year. The study analysed the hours these young people spent working and the impact of this on time spent on study time, other activities and their grades at GCSE level. Dr Angus Holford, who wrote the report called Youth Employment and Academic Performance, says approximately a quarter of 13 to 16-year-olds take on some form of formal paid employment during term time. ‘This can be a good thing – they earn their own money and can pick up useful skills, which might help them find full-time work in the future,’ he said, according to The Observer. ‘However, they may spend that hard-earned money on less than useful things, or fall in with a different group of people. ‘We did find that schoolchildren who worked became more likely to drink alcohol regularly, smoke or consume cannabis.’ He added the long-term effect of employment would be particularly damaging for ‘borderline students’ – those who are at risk of not achieving the targets needed (five A*-C grades, including English and mathematics) to progression into further education. Dr Holford added that as academic results at 16 have such a great influence over future careers, the results of his study should come as a warning to parents who want children to achieve their full potential.

(CNN)Thomas Muller might be a World Cup winner with Germany but at home he has a different title: managing director of carrots. That's because his wife, Lisa, is an aspiring dressage rider with her own designs on conquering the sport she loves. And the hours they spend at stables just outside Munich seem to be paying dividends, Lisa picking up her first title at national level over the weekend. While the 25-year-old hones her craft in the world of prancing horses, Thomas takes a keen interest in breeding, as well as reveling in the solitude of an environment that is a stratosphere away from the pressurized spotlight he is used to. "I come here to watch if everything's fine," he told CNN in the couple's first joint television interview. "And for the carrots. I'm the managing director of carrots! I watch the dogs. Sometimes I help a little bit but it's her business. "I enjoy it a lot. They make me feel comfortable, the attitude and what they look like and [the way they] live their lives. It's fun. It's easy to relax around horses." At 25, Muller is as decorated in the world of soccer as they come. He has a glut of domestic trophies, including three German Bundesliga titles, and claimed the European Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup crowns with Bayern Munich in 2013. Last year in Brazil he landed the ultimate prize when Germany powered its way to a first World Cup triumph since 1990, memorably beating hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semis before edging past Argentina in the final. But you won't hear much talk of that landmark moment in Muller's career around the stables. "He's interested in horses so when we are together we talk about horses and not really about football," Lisa explained. "He knows more about horses than I know about football." While Muller has enjoyed overwhelming success at an early stage in his career, Lisa's path is a more arduous and exhaustive one. Though she has been riding horses since her Granddad introduced her to the sport aged four, it takes time to build a strong bond with a horse in dressage. And though her recent victory at the Grand Prix in the Bavarian town of Kreuth shows she is clearly in tune with her horse Birkhofs Dave, Lisa says her learning curve is a lengthy one. "You have to do eight years to learn everything but then you still don't know everything. You always keep learning," she said. "It's not like other sports, you always train yourself, you have to get a harmony between the horse and yourself. "It has its own mind, its own feelings. You have to become a team and that's why it takes so much time. Every horse is different so you have to feel it. "I want to get better and better. Maybe at some point I will be very good, that's my dream. [The Olympics] would be a dream. "I think for every sportsman it's a dream and you want to reach it but just a few people can reach it. Maybe, maybe not." According to Lisa's coach, Götz Brinkmann, that is a distinct possibility. Last year's qualification for the prestigious Piaff-Förderpreis -- a national series for riders aged 25 or below -- underlined her potential. "I've never had a student that developed that fast no matter what horses they had," Brinkmann told CNN. "She's got the will and she's got the talent and she doesn't stop. She keeps on working. And not so many riders have the ability and that makes her fortunate in a way. "I think she'll be able to be successful on an international level for sure." Muller is of the same opinion. Though he is forbidden from riding himself -- to prevent sustaining an injuries that might impact on his football career -- he has taken a keen interest in the relationship between his wife and Birkhofs Dave. Both the couple's disciplines rely on a high skill level, but also strong communication, and though the competition is fierce, Muller has high hopes for the pair. "The potential is there," he said. "He's our best talent I think and the number one in our stable and for Lisa. "But it's no guarantee for success because in Germany there's a lot of opponents. A lot of good riders and a lot of good other horses. Like in football. "She has no pressure. I want that she's happy with the horses, with the work and with the competitions. But it's not easy. "It's very tough to get up in Germany in the dressage sport. She needs time to develop her quality. We're on a good way and we need to go for it." Muller can also see parallels in the way some horses with potential develop into thoroughbreds, whether in racing or dressage circles, while some fall by the wayside. "There are some talents and they grow up and go to the top," he said. "And some talents don't get to the top. "It's interesting to watch, the development of the different horses from when they come to the stable and when they leave. But he [Birkhofs Dave] stays for sure." Muller has his own sideline at the stables too -- breeding. "Breeding is a little bit for fun," he explained. "For sure I want to breed the best horse I can. But it's difficult and a bit of luck. But I try my best to optimize. "My dream is one day that Lisa rides a horse that I bred. But that's a long way to go." Though she often goes to watch Thomas play at Bayern Munich's home stadium -- the Allianz Arena -- Lisa doesn't even remotely fit the WAG stereotype. The wives and girlfriends of high-profile footballers are often portrayed as carefully manicured, fashion-obsessed shopaholics -- an image cultivated by the tabloid newspapers. But Lisa, who chose not to travel with Thomas to the World Cup in Brazil last year, has not one scrap of jealousy when it comes to the superstar treatment her famous husband gets. "I don't," she said. "You have the bad sides also. Everyone comes and wants to get a photo, a selfie or an autograph. That would be too much. I can't do that like Thomas can do it. "He's so easy going. And I want to do my horses by myself. I can groom them the best, I can ride them the best and I love them the most. "They're my partner, my brother. I can tell them every problem. They're the most important part in my life." This statement provoked a laugh from her husband: "I have already accepted it," he joked. "Maybe I'm number five. But it's OK."	Wife of Bayern Munich Germany star Thomas Muller is an aspiring dressage rider . Lisa Muller recently won her first title at national level on board Birkhofs Dave .

(CNN)U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday that "we need to close ... gaps" with Iran in talks about its nuclear program, adding that those negotiating with Iranian officials "are deeply committed to ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon." Iran faces a March 24 deadline to reach a deal about its nuclear program. Several interim agreements have been made in recent months, though a long-term pact so far has been elusive. Speaking in Paris alongside French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, Kerry said progress has been made "but there remain gaps, divergences." He acknowledged "the days are ticking by," but that doesn't mean there's an urgent rush to reach an agreement. "We have to get the right deal," the top U.S. diplomat said. Kerry said one thing all members of the P5+1 group -- which consists of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, plus Germany -- agree on is that it's imperative Iran doesn't develop nuclear arms. Iranian minister: Some consider peace an 'existential threat' Officials in Tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes, not to create atomic weaponry. "We will find out whether or not ... Iran's prepared to take the steps to answer the questions that the world has a right to get answers to," Kerry said.

Our ability to answer questions currently separates us from machines in the world of artificial intelligence. But researchers are working on algorithms to give computers this skill too. Now, scientists at Facebook have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer, if they can ever match human brainpower – but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too. Scientists at Facebook (logo shown) have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer if they can ever match human brainpower – but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too . The team from the social media firm’s AI lab in New York have come up with a list of 20 questions to separate humans from robots, because they say ‘many existing learning systems can currently not solve them.’ They test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. 1) The first question of the 20 listed in the research paper was the simplest for a computer to answer. It is: . John is in the playground . Bob is in the office . Where is John? 2) A harder example for a computer to answer is a question that requires it to differentiate three separate arguments, such as: . Mary gave the cake to Fred. Fred gave the cake to Bill. Jeff was given the milk by Fred. Who gave the cake to Fred? Who did Fred give the cake to? What did Jeff receive? Who gave the milk? 3) Another task tested a machine's ability to perform simple counting operations by asking about the number of objects. For example: . Daniel picked up the football. Daniel dropped the football. Daniel got the milk. Daniel took the apple. How many objects is Daniel holding? 4) Basic deduction skills were tested by questions such as: . Sheep are afraid of wolves. Cats are afraid of dogs. Mice are afraid of cats. Gertrude is a sheep. What is Gertrude afraid of? 5) And reasoning about size was tested by this question: . The football fits in the suitcase. The suitcase fits in the cupboard. The box of chocolates is smaller than the football. Will the box of chocolates sit in the suitcase? The intelligent computers were tested on 20 questions in total, but none of them got a perfect score. The answers to the five examples listed, are shown above . The sometimes tricky questions test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. A stock image of a perplexed person is shown . Some of the questions require machines to recall facts, while others need reasoning, or to count the number of objects, expressed in a written passage. The researchers say that humans should be able to score full marks. While you may have got one answer wrong, none of the seven computer learning programmes that Facebook tested got all 20 questions right. The experiment was designed to test whether a machine can answer questions ‘via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more,’ the study published on arXiv says. Scientists are keen to create this ability so that humans can talk fluently with machines, which could lead to robots looking after the elderly and more intelligent websites, for example. The paper says: ‘One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an intelligent dialogue agent.’ The experts aim to ‘classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems.’ The results of the test show that humans are still ahead of the game when it comes to interpreting the world’s subtleties and language. The questions are written in very clear and simple terms so there is still a way to go before computers catch us up.	Test was developed by experts at Facebook to test machines with AI . It's comprised of 20 questions testing reasoning and language skills . Humans are expected to get a full score, with careful consideration . None of the AI algorithms managed this showing more research is needed .
Neymar has revealed he has no plans to move over to the Premier League any time soon. The Barcelona and Brazil star is one of the hottest properties in world football and could have his pick of the planet’s top clubs if he decided to leave the Spanish giants. Neymar is still only 23 yet that has not stopped him racing to 43 goals in 62 games for Brazil and he was the poster boy of the World Cup last summer. Neymar, Brazil's captain and superstar, says he has no desire to move to England any time soon . Neymar embraces his 'big friend' Alexis Sanchez, who was a team-mate of his at Barcelona until last summer . But being in only his second year at Barcelona following a £48.6million move from Brazilian club side Santos in June 2013, he wants to stay there for far longer. Neymar said: ‘As for playing in England myself, I’m very happy playing for Barcelona and I still have a long road to walk here.' Neymar played at Barcelona with Alexis Sanchez before the Chilean moved over to Arsenal last summer. ‘Alexis is a big friend,’ he added, ‘and someone who I had the privilege of playing with at Barcelona. We used to get along very well on and off the field, so I’m very happy to see him so well at Arsenal.’ Neymar says he enjoyed playing with Sanchez but does not want to join him at Arsenal . The Chile and Brazil stars played out a friendly at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium this weekend . The pair went head-to-head in Brazil’s 1-0 win against Chile at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon and Sanchez paid tribute to his former team-mate. ‘Neymar raised everyone’s spirits as he is a very joyful person,’ Sanchez said. ‘I hope he never changes. 'His happiness is contagious and that’s something I really like. Regarding his quality, I cannot come up with something new. Everybody knows how good he is. ‘He dares to so some stuff with the ball no one would dare to that. That’s the beauty of football.’	Neymar and Alexis Sanchez starred during Brazil's win over Chile . Barcelona forward said he gets on with Sanchez 'on and off the pitch' But Neymar insists he is happy in Spain, and has no desire to move .
A team of scientists claim it has found a way to inject people’s eyes with ‘night vision’. The research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft (50 metres) in almost total darkness for 'several hours'. By injecting his eyes with a liquid solution, he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time, while others who hadn't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases. Californian researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision. The solution combines Chlorin e6 (Ce6) with insulin and saline. A small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher's eyes. It briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed, seen in this image of researcher Gabriel Licina . The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called ‘biohackers’ in California called Science for the Masses. They used a solution of a substance called Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which is found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also been used in cancer treatment research. Combining Ce6 with insulin and saline, the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions. In April, researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor, which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses. Created by University of Michigan researchers Ted Norris and Zhaohui Zhong, the sensor uses an atom-thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses. Graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals. The process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light, Wired reported. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.' They note in their paper, though, that ‘the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution.’ As a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home. Russell Peake, Eye Health Condition Manager at Boots Opticians, told MailOnline that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment. 'Unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist, GP or pharmacist, people should not be inserting anything into their eyes,' he warned. 'An invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment, as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye’s surface or tears, potentially leading to vision loss. 'Whilst the idea of "night vision eye drops" may seem interesting, this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval. 'We would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice.' The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called ‘biohackers’ in California called Science for the Masses. It is not advisable to try this at home. They used a solution containing Chlorin e6 (Ce6), found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also used in cancer treatment research . In the team's experiment, the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of Gabriel Licina, one of the researchers, which carried the solution to his retinas. ‘Ce6 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50μl [microlitres] into each eye,’ the researchers wrote. The solution  initially made his eyes turn black, before being absorbed in a few seconds and returning his eyes to their natural colour. 'To me, it was a quick, greenish-black blur across my vision, and then it dissolved into my eyes,' Mr Licina told Mic. However, to ‘reduce the potential for bright light exposure,’ the team covered his eyes in black contact lenses. Within an hour his vision had noticeably improved in low-light conditions. To test the effects, Mr Licina and four ‘control’ subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a ‘darkened area’. Within an hour, Mr Licina was able to see in darkness - for several hours. In experiments he could see three times better than 'normal' eyes. After testing, Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning seemed to return to normal. Shown is a stock image of US soldiers in Iraq in 2003 . They were then asked to identify symbols in the dark, either moving or still, and to spot individuals moving in a small grove of trees. ‘The Ce6 subject consistently recognised symbols that did not seem to be visible to the controls,’ the researchers wrote. And, in the second test: ‘The Ce6 subject identified the distant figures 100 per cent of the time, with the controls showing a 33 per cent identification rate.’ After testing, the team said that Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning appeared to return to normal. ‘As of 20 days, there have been no noticeable effects,’ they said. While they note that more testing is needed, the initial results suggest that the technique can provide low light amplification in the human eye. ‘Further testing is need to confirm and measure the degree of improvement in health subjects,’ they concluded.

UberX driver Gerald Montgomery, 51, allegedly took a passenger to the airport and then returned to her Denver home to try and break in . An UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly took a passenger to the airport and then returned to her Denver home to try and break in. Gerald Montgomery, 51, went to the woman's home after driving her to Denver International Airport and attempted to get in through the back door, according to a police spokesman. Police said Montgomery fled when the unidentified woman's roommate, who was inside the house, noticed him. The woman sent her roommate the Uber receipt, which featured Montgomery's photograph. Her roommate then posted the receipt on her Facebook page with a message to warn her friends. 'I had just gotten home when he was about to get in the back door,' she wrote, according to Fox 31. 'He probably thought no one else was here. Friends that take Uber, please be careful.' Police were able to identify Montgomery after seeing the receipt  and took him into custody at Jefferson County jail on suspicion of attempted second-degree burglary. Uber officials said they have contacted the passenger and refunded her ride, which cost $39.88. A spokesperson for the company said they also immediately deactivated Montgomery's 'access to the platform', according to the Denver Post. The company added that Montgomery had passed all criminal and driving history background checks before he was allowed to become a driver for the popular app. But, at least for his last passenger, that's not enough to make her feel safe. She told Fox 31 she would never use Uber again, even if it meant having to pay $90 to take a cab home from the airport.

Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are facing an uphill battle in the Orlando popularity stakes this weekend. Disney World is a real life Magic Kingdom for millions yet not even the grandest of shows or white knuckle rides will match the atmosphere in the creaking, cavernous Citrus Bowl on Sunday afternoon. A sell-out crowd of 62,000 will make their way downtown to witness Orlando City, led out by Brazilian legend Kaka, in their inaugural MLS match against another fellow newcomer in the shape of NYCFC. David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City . Brazilian star Kaka will also play in the match on Sunday, for the new MLS franchise Orlando City . The match will take place at Florida's Citrus Bowl, which was a venue at the 1994 USA World Cup . It’s an opening day fixture to get the marketing men salivating. Yet while the newfangled New York franchise have literally started from scratch, this match, shown live on Sky Sports in the UK, marks the culmination of four years of hard work and realised dreams. Adrian Heath, the former England Under 21 and Everton midfielder, has been in charge all of that time , thanks in no small part to a chance meeting in a Newcastle-under-Lyme pub with a bloke called Phil Rawlins. Rawlins, a director at Stoke City who founded a highly successful IT sales and marketing consulting company in Texas, has lived in the US for 17 years and was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes. Heath was keen too. Former Everton midfielder Adrian Heath has guided Orlando City to MLS after four years of hard work . Heath's appointment came after a chance meeting with Phil Rawlins (right), who was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes . Out of work after not having a caretaker stint at Coventry City turn into a permanent role , the 54 year-old had already witnessed what effect the beautiful game was having in the US during a pre-season tour which took him to the fanatical footballing hotbed of Portland. The possibilities fascinated him. Initially the pair, introduced to each other by agent Gary Mellor, went to Texas where Rawlins founded the Austin Aztecs. At this point, leaving the USL Pro, the third tier of the American soccer scene, and joining MLS was more than a pipedream. So Rawlins upped sticks and relocated everyone to Florida. And Orlando City were born. Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be at the game and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out' A first championship was secured in their inaugural season and, impressively, a fan base in a state which has enjoyed its fair share of disappointments following the folding of MLS side Miami Fusion in 2002 (Fusion were based in Fort Lauderdale, a good 200 miles away), the Orlando natives got straight behind the Lions. Another regular season title and a second championship followed. That has ensured that Heath has achieved a rare feat – taking a team up through the levels in a country where promotion and relegation are dirty words. Unlike New York City, there is a strong feeling of continuity allied with a natural connection to the city. Eight players remain the squad from their final USL Pro season. NYCFC manager Jason Kreis will lead his team out for their first ever MLS match on Sunday . NYCFC will begin in front of a 62,000 sell-out crowd against Orlando City at Citrus Bowl in Florida . Yet not everything came easily. Behind the scenes, Rawlins was working tirelessly. He desperately wanted to take the club on to the highest level. That, however, needs more than sweat and toil on the pitch. With top level franchise costs rocketing from $7.5 to $100 million, big bucks are needed to take a seat at the top table. They were snubbed by MLS in 2012. Enter Brazilian millionaire Flavio Augusto da Silva in February 2013. Having made his money in setting up English language schools back home, his arrival has been key. He provides the conduit between South America and the US, a partnership which satisfies many people on myriad levels. Naturally, his wealth and business expertise have ensured Orlando City’s dream has become a striking reality. His links into the South American market, where so much talent bubbles under the surface, have been crucial – Columbia, El Salvador and Brazil are all represented in Heath’s squad. Honduran striker Bryan Rochez,19, is the youngest designated player in the League. Seb Hines (top right) has arrived on loan from Middlesbrough and will play for Orlando in their opening game . Sean St Ledger, formerly of Preston and Leicester, is also set to make his MLS bow on Sunday . Former Birmingham City midfielder Lewis Neal ,the loan arrivals of Seb Hines from Middlesbrough and Republic of Ireland international and free agent Sean St Ledger give their English boss a reminder of home and some experience to boot. Most importantly though, Orlando is the No 1 holiday destination for Brazil’s middle classes. So where better to start an Anglo-American-Brazilian franchise? An impressive 20,000 were at a championship match against Charlotte. MLS couldn't deny them again. Their place as the 21st franchise was confirmed nine months after Da Silva's arrival. The prospect of even more tourist dollars flowing into the city has got the club firmly on-side with the local authorities and businesses. New York City have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase . Flavio Augusto da Silva (left) has been key to the progress of Orlando City since his arrival in February 2013 . Unlike in Miami when it comes to David Beckham, they are right behind his plans, so much so that, after agreeing a public and private partnership plan, a brand spanking new 19,500 stadium could be ready for the start of next season. Walt Disney World Resort are one of the founding sponsors. Oh, and he is friends with Kaka. When Da Silva came calling, the 32 year-old former world footballer of the year didn’t have to think twice. The $7.2 million salary - making him the best paid player in the League - certainly helped. His fanfare arrival piqued interest like never before. Kaka is the man Heath is building his team and vision around. Injuries over the years may have taken their toll yet he still managed 56 games last term for AC Milan and Sao Paulo. The kind of touch and awareness which saw him join Real Madrid for an eye watering £57 million in 2009 will be there for all to see. Da Silva and Rawlins’ business plan has been ticking all the boxes so it will be fascinating to see how Heath adapts to MLS and the injection of quality he will encounter week in, week out. Only two expansion teams have reached the end of season playoffs in their debut campaign, so history is not on Orlando’s side. The chairman has already stated that his men have to make sure they’re the third. The pressure is on without a ball being kicked. Yet with such brilliant support in the stands, the city and the boardroom, you get the feeling Heath’s men are onto a winner, whatever happens. Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard – New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.	New York City and Orlando City face each other in their first MLS match . A sell-out crowd of 62,000 will witness the match at Citrus Bowl . The match marks the culmination four years of hard work for Orlando City . David Villa and Kaka are both expected to start the match in Florida .
Miriam Clegg, pictured in Leicester Square today, lifted the lid on life at home with husband Nick and their three sons Alberto, Antonio and Miguel . Miriam Clegg today boasted that she is a much better cook than her husband Nick, as the political battle of the kitchens continued. The Lib Dem leader’s wife mocked Ed Miliband’s two kitchens, insisting she only had one and it did not have a sofa. She also agreed her husband is a ‘dish’, spoke about her faith, and revealed how she won the battle to give their three sons Spanish names. The Spanish lawyer, who uses her maiden name Miriam González Durántez, used a series of interviews today to promote her Inspiring Women campaign to encourage school girls to reach their full potential. She said: ‘This is not about famous women and celebrities This is about all women. When people say there are not enough women role models its because they do not realise that the role models are not necessarily always in glossy magazines. They surround me in the streets, right? ‘I think this is too important the girls realise they can look for role models wherever they are. They are all there, they just need to look for them.’ She lifted the lid on life at home with husband Nick and their three sons Alberto, Antonio and Miguel. Appearing on LBC radio, she was quizzed about her recipe for croquetas, which she once cooked for Nigella Lawson. She insisted that she is a much better cook than Nick. ‘When it comes to cooking there is no contest. I’m better. There are few things I will win, cooking is one of them.’ In the run-up to the general election there has been much focus on the interior – and number – kitchens owned by politicians. After Mr Miliband posed in a small kitchenette with his wife Justine, it emerged that he had a larger kitchen on a lower floor. And David Cameron has been seen in both his Downing Street kitchen and at his constituency home in Oxfordshire, where he made his surprise vow not to seek a third term. The Prime Minister said last week: ‘To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time. It needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework.’ But Mrs Clegg protested: ‘I only one have kitchen and I don’t even have a sofa in my kitchen.’ The Spanish lawyer, who uses her maiden name Miriam González Durántez, used a series of interviews today to promote her Inspiring Women campaign to encourage school girls to reach their full potential . Miriam Clegg boasted that she is a better cook than husband Nick, but insisted she only has one kitchen at their home in Putney, south west London . The couple met when they were studying in Belgium, and they married in 2000. She denied that they met dancing, and was honest about what first attracted him to her: ‘When you’re 20 you're impressed by anything else but by the looks.’ When LBC presenter Shelagh Fogarty remarked that the Lib Dem leader is a ‘dish’, Mrs Clegg replied: Well that’s what I think.’ But Fogarty went too far when she said he was ‘good looking in a head boy kind of way’. Mrs Clegg shot back: ‘You are talking about my husband!’ Mr Clegg spent the day answering questions at a Mumsnet event (left) and launching a Mental Health Charter for Sport and Recreation (right) Mrs Clegg is a staunch Catholic, and their sons are being brought up as Catholic despite Mr Clegg being an atheist. The family often attend Mass together in west London. She said: ‘Listen I have faith and I have always that faith is a gift., it has helped me in my own life to cope with some of the difficulties. ‘This is probably too personal a comment but when I lost my father its what carried me through. I hope that I can pass it on to my children, or at least I will try to bring it there then it’s up to them to make up their mind. ‘We are very tolerant generally of all faiths and in our families we have all sorts of faiths.’ She also revealed how their three sons got Spanish first names. ‘They’ve got Clegg afterwards, it was to compensate,;’ she said. Antonio was her father’s name ‘so he couldn’t say no’, and she almost died when she was giving birth to Alberto ‘so he had to give it to me’. Miguel is the patron saint of the village where she is from in Spain.	Miriam Clegg boasts that she is better in the kitchen than husband Nick .

The award ceremony at Crufts was overshadowed by a protester who ran onto the stage as the winner of Best in Show was presented with the trophy after a competition of seemingly never-ending drama. As Rebecca Cross and her Scottish terrier Knopa were handed the trophy at the prestigious dog show, the suited man charged in front of the winning pair, holding aloft a sign which read 'Mutts Against Crufts'. The demonstrator was quickly hauled off stage by four members of security as the shocked crowd watched in astonishment, eventually leaving owner Ms Cross and Knopa to enjoy their victory. Top dog: Rebecca Cross and Scottish terrier Knopa won the Best in Show category after earlier winning the terrier group . Barking mad: The glitzy award ceremony at Crufts was tarnished by a protester who ran onto the stage as the winner of Best in Show was presented with her trophy . The demonstrator smirked as he was hauled off stage by four members of security as the shocked crowd watched in astonishment . The protest is the second controversy to hit this year's Crufts, with an owner claiming that her prize-winning red setter was poisoned. Dee Milligan-Bott said her dog, known by its competing name Thendara Satisfaction, collapsed and died on Friday and she believes the three-year-old must have been poisoned at the competition the day before. And just when it seemed the dog show could not get any more dramatic, it emerged that winning owner Ms Cross almost did not make the grand finale after her flight from America was delayed. According to Dogs in the News, the proud owner said: 'I can’t believe it, I am in complete shock. I almost didn’t make it, my flight was delayed, and I thought I wouldn’t make it in time. 'Knopa is one in a million. She was Best of Breed here in 2013 and it’s been a really wild ride. It hasn’t sunk in yet, I really can’t believe it. She was supposed to retire today so if so this was her retirement show.' Ms Cross and Knopa, who was bred the U.S. under Russian owners and competes under the name McVan’s to Russia With Love, had earlier won the terrier group before taking the Best in Show award. The Scottish terrier, who is the first of its breed to be crowned top dog since 1929, beat Dublin, a flat coated retriever, into a well-earned second place. Dublin, from Sweden, had earlier won the Gundog group.

Dubbed the 'toy and utility' day, today was the final installment of this year's competition - which has been marked by an array of incredible and outrageous costumes. Among the competitors at Birmingham's NEC arena were dogs in colourful body suits, ankle warmers and bibs - while one Yorkshire terrier appeared on stage wearing curlers and a nightie. Crufts is the world's largest dog show with beloved pets competing in categories include agility, heelwork to music and the ever-popular flyball final. In addition to competitors' shows, the fourth day featured a presentation of the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year Award. There was also an RAF display and a traditional presentation of a painting to the 2014 Best In Show Winner. This year's show has also seen been hit by tragedy after a prize-winning  competitor died amid fears that the animal was poisoned. Owner Dee Milligan-Bott said her dog, known by its competing name Thendara Satisfaction, collapsed on Friday and she believes the three-year-old Irish setter must have been poisoned at Crufts the day before. Writing on Facebook she said that an autopsy found cubes of beef in Jagger's stomach were apparently found 'stuffed with two to three different poisons.'

A black female police officer who previously acted as a bodyguard for the Duchess of Cambridge is suing a police force because she claims she was sacked after accusing another officer of racism. Ricky Haruna claims she was sacked for gross misconduct after she claimed a police sergeant at the Metropolitan Police had racially harassed her. Ms Haruna claims that after she made the allegation Sergeant Laurence Boyle convinced an elderly woman with dementia to make false claims of fraud against her. This led to Miss Haruna being hauled before a misconduct panel and dismissed, only to be reinstated after a successful internal appeal. Ricky Haruna joined the Met Police in 2002 and one of her jobs was escorting Kate Middleton before she married . The 39-year-old is now suing the Met Police for race discrimination and wrongful dismissal for the way it handled her case, with her previous claims of racism not forming part of her own misconduct hearing, the Central London Employment Tribunal was told. She claims that although the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) was aware of the race allegations she had made, these were not put before the police misconduct board. Ms Haruna joined the Met Police in 2002 and one of her duties was escorting Kate Middleton before she married Prince William and became the Duchess of Cambridge. During her career she saved two people's lives and received two commendations. Ms Haruna claims she experienced racism from her police colleagues in 2010, and also reported that Sergeant Boyle racially harassed her. Following her allegation an elderly woman came forward and accused Miss Haruna of fraud. This led to what Ms Haruna refers to as her 'malicious arrest' in April 2013. Ms Haruna appeared before a misconduct panel and - despite the Crown Prosecution Service saying the fraud allegation was untenable and they would not be bringing charges in September 2013 - she was disciplined and sacked last June. But in February she was reinstated with full pay after a successful internal appeal against her dismissal. Lawrence Davies, representing Ms Haruna, said in his skeleton argument: 'Prior to her dismissal, the claimant had complained of racism on several occasions. She also claimed that she was being harassed and victimised...The DPS were aware of that allegation. 'However, the DPS failed to put this relevant evidence before the Police Misconduct Board.' He added that Ms Haruna did not raise these claims herself because of 'bad advice' from the Police Federation, the DPS had a 'clear duty' to do so. He said that in light of panel not having any knowledge of the evidence of discrimination, it made the 'wrongful decision' to dismiss her. Mr Davies said: 'We do say PS Boyle is racist and that this sorry saga began when he pressurised a very elderly lady with dementia to make a formal complaint of fraud against the claimant.' He added that PS Boyle's questioning of the woman, who also imagined that Ms Haruna had had an abortion and that Lord Russell had bought her a house, caused her to become 'very upset'. Ms Haruna was reinstated in February this year . It is not argued that the misconduct panel was prejudicial, but that the wrong decision it made was rendered discriminatory by the racist motivation of the DPS and/or PS Boyle. Mr Davies also drew attention to the employment tribunal of black police officer Pc Carol Howard in which the Met admitted it had a written policy to ensure that no discrimination complaint was successful. Ms Howard won £37,000 in her race and sex discrimination claim. However Louise Chudleigh, representing the Metropolitan Police, said once the the CPS had decided to not take any action against Ms Haruna for the fraud allegations, the matter was dealt with as a disciplinary issue, leading to her dismissal. She said Ms Haruna could not have a wrongful dismissal case because she had been reinstated. She further argued that the Pc could not bring race claims because the panel that dismissed her was protected from discrimination claims by judicial immunity proceedings. But Mr Davies said it would be 'absurd' if the officer could not bring her discrimination claim because he said 'even the MPS has accepted that the decision was wrong and given the importance of tackling discrimination in society and in particular the police.' Employment Judge Harjit Grewal reserved her judgment on whether Ms Haruna can bring a case of wrongful dismissal and race discrimination against the Met. Another preliminary hearing has been scheduled for April 30.	Ricky Haruna was sacked from the Met Police last year for misconduct .

Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)Ferguson's police chief is ducking questions about his department and his future there in the wake of a scathing federal report. "I need to have time to really analyze this report so I can comment on it," Chief Tom Jackson said Thursday in an exclusive interview with CNN. He spoke one day after the Justice Department released its 102-page report, which found rampant racism within the Ferguson Police Department. It specifically faulted officers for seeing residents as "sources of revenue," a practice that disproportionately targeted African-Americans. DOJ: No charges for Officer Darren Wilson . When asked what he thought about the report, and what he planned to do about it, the chief said he would "take action as necessary." Asked whether that meant he would remain at the department, Jackson repeated himself: "I'm gonna take action where necessary." Later, in response to the same question, he said: "I will let you know." Brown's family to file civil lawsuit 'shortly' Many have called for the chief to step down since the shooting death of Michael Brown. Brown, a black teenager, was shot by a white officer in August. His death triggered widespread protests, and calls to change policing practices in America. Obama: Ferguson police abuse 'not an isolated incident' Sara Sidner reported this story in Ferguson.

It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. David Villa has hit the ground running in New York and Wayne Rooney's celebration was a knockout. But Fulham are staring at successive relegations and questions remain about Roy Hodgson's England squad. WHAT'S HOT . DAVID VILLA . The former Spain forward is New York City FC’s captain and lit up Yankee Stadium in front of 45,000 last weekend, scoring one and making one. Meanwhile, Frank Lampard has played precisely two hours of Premier League football since choosing Manchester over New York in December. David Villa scored for New York City against New England Revolution last weekend . WAYNE ROONEY . Great goal against Tottenham, great celebration too. After news of his kitchen boxing match with Phil Bardsley appeared in the Sun, though, there are lessons. Choose friends you can trust and never again be caught wearing white socks anywhere other than on a tennis court. Wayne Rooney responded to a leaked video of him boxing with a knockout celebration against Tottenham . Rooney fell to the Old Trafford turf as if he had been knocked out, as appeared to be the case in the video . PAT MURPHY . Interviews by broadcast sports journalists can occasionally lack a little depth but BBC’s stalwart came off his long run when questioning national selector James Whitaker on the Kevin Pietersen issue this week. It was captivating work, born of courage and great experience. GEOFF THOMAS . A good footballer but even better person, the former England player has kept cancer at bay for 12 years now and has raised thousands in the process. If his decision to ride several Tour stages with Lance Armstrong this summer does not please everyone I am sure he will cope. Geoff Thomas (right) plans to cycle several stages of the Tour de France this summer with Lance Armstrong . WHAT'S NOT . FULHAM . Five years ago this week Craven Cottage witnessed a 4-1 destruction of Juventus. Now Fulham are threatened with relegation from the Championship, having won once in thirteen games. This is what happens when you choose the wrong managers. Fulham's 3-0 defeat to Leeds in midweek left the Cottagers mired in a relegation battle in the Championship . Five years ago, Fulham beat Juventus at Craven Cottage en-route to the Europa League final . ROY HODGSON . An England squad with almost as many left-backs (three) as strikers (four) suggests Hodgson is about to experiment with 7-2-1 against Lithuania or doesn’t actually know where Leighton Baines plays. It’s a dispiriting selection and tells us all we need to know about our prospects at Euro 2016. ALASTAIR COOK . English cricket’s sense of self-pity has now spread to those who haven’t even been playing. Cook should realise that although the decision to appoint Eoin Morgan as World Cup captain wasn’t right, it doesn’t mean that jettisoning him beforehand was necessarily wrong. RAHAT ALI . After his dropped catch eased Australia’s passage to the last four of the World Cup, the young Pakistan fielder looked shell shocked but the worst is yet to come. At some point in the coming weeks, young Ali will have to go home. Pakistan's Rahat Ali drops a catch as Pakistan were knocked out of the World Cup by Australia .

Target has proposed to pay $10million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought against the retailer following a massive data breach in 2013. Individuals affected by the breach could get up to a maximum of $10,000 each, the proposal says. Details of as many as 40million credit and debit card accounts were exposed during the breach, which hurt its holiday sales that year. Scroll down for video . Target, based in Minneapolis, has proposed to pay $10million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought against it following a massive data breach in 2013 . The company has offered free credit monitoring for affected customers and overhauled its security systems. The proposed settlement would also require Minneapolis-based Target Corp. to appoint a chief information security officer, keep a written information security program and offer security training to its workers. It would be required to establish a procedure to monitor data security, and to respond swiftly to future breaches. 'We are pleased to see the process moving forward and look forward to its resolution,' Target spokesman Molly Snyder said in an emailed statement. The company said in court documents filed in Minnesota that the funds for reimbursements will be kept in an interest-bearing escrow account. Claims will mostly be submitted and processed online, through a dedicated website. Target's data breach in 2013 exposed details of as many as 40 million credit and debit card accounts and hurt its holiday sales that year . The chain has worked hard to lure back customers that were hesitant to shop there after the incident. Over the 2014 holiday season, Target offered free shipping on all items. It recently announced that it was cutting its minimum online purchase to qualify for free shipping in half to $25. And on Wednesday the retailer said it will now allow returns for up to a year for its private and exclusive brands. Target's bounce back from a turbulent stretch including the data breach and exit from Canada has been met with optimism on Wall Street. The retailer's stock traded above $80 for the first time Monday. Earlier this month, Target said it would lay off about 1,700 people, eliminate another 1,400 unfilled positions and cut up to $2billion in costs. It will also focus more on technology to boost online sales growth. This will involve an investment of about $1billion, which will be aimed at beefing up business from shoppers who are more likely to shop online. A court hearing on the proposed settlement is set for Thursday in St. Paul, Minneapolis.	Target's 2013 data breach exposed details of up to 40million bank accounts .

Jailed: Juraj Orsula, 46, claimed he had been blinded by the sun when his red Mercedes Actros lorry crashed into the back of queuing traffic . A Slovakian lorry driver who killed three members of the same family and injured eight others after ploughing into the back of stationary traffic on a motorway has been jailed. Juraj Orsula, 46, claimed he had been blinded by the sun when his red Mercedes Actros lorry crashed into the back of queuing traffic, which had built up on the M26 in Kemsing, Kent, after two previous collisions earlier that morning. Helen Akande, 22, and her sister Mary, 16, both students from Sarcelles, France, died at the scene of the crash in April last year, while their father Michael, 54, died two weeks later in hospital as a result of his injuries. Three people in another vehicle suffered serious injuries, including a boy aged seven who suffered a severe brain injury, a boy aged three who had a broken leg and a 36-year-old man with a fractured skull and brain injury. Orsula, of Topolcany, Slovakia, pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court yesterday to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and three counts of causing serious injury while driving dangerously. He was jailed for six and a half years, and disqualified from driving for seven years. Crash: Traffic had built up on the M26 in Kemsing, Kent, after two previous collisions earlier that morning . Sentencing: Orsula pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) yesterday to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and three counts of causing serious injury while driving dangerously . Detective Constable David Holmes, from Kent Police, said: ‘The events of that day will linger long in the memory of those affected, some of whom will never fully recover from their injuries. ‘Juraj Orsula claims he was blinded by the sun in the moments leading up to the collision, which should have been reason enough to reduce his speed. ‘Instead he continued to drive as normal before crashing into stationary traffic and leaving a trail of devastation. He must now live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.’ Mr Holmes added: 'Hopefully Orsula's sentencing will mark the start of the healing process for everyone affected by this devastating incident, and our thoughts are with them all today.'

A fishing guide who was accused of hurling abuse at his clients and defecating off the front of the boat has hit back at allegations made by disgruntled customers. Manager Allan Beale of Darwin’s Barra Base has been slammed over his alleged behaviour on the Australian travel website Trip Advisor. One client, under the name ‘robrobbo’ from Brisbane has penned his fishing safari experience with Beale as ‘so bad it was great’ after staying at the lodge with four other friends in February last year. Manager Allan Beale (left) of Darwin’s Barra Base has been running his business for more than 12 years . ‘Once we hit the water with Allan I think we were all looking around for the hidden cameras!’ the post read. ‘Abused at the boat ramp whilst attempting to help him launch the boat, abused when we hooked a fish, abused when we lost a fish, witnesses to the man himself defecating off the front of the boat…’ In response to these allegations, Beale told Daily Mail Australia the review was not true and are based on ‘one side of exaggeration’. ‘The reviews were pretty rude and distorted to the facts,’ Beale said. ‘Customer service is our business. We've been in the tourism business for more than 12 years and I'm saddened to read these false allegations after all these years.' Beale said the allegation was not true and are based on ‘one side of exaggeration’ - he also added that 'catfish are a pest' so he 'assists to minimise the population' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale said one person had suffered a sore back during this trip so he suggested an alternative because the man couldn't handle the rough waves and everyone was happy to choose the other location for fish species . Another client, under the name ‘Les N’ from Perth also took to the travel website to post their ‘overrated and disappointing’ experience. ‘I wrote a review on Alan's Facebook account after he used pictures of my group holding fish up that quite frankly I couldn't believe we kept?’ the post read. ‘We came here to catch sailfish & Barra? What a joke, not one sailfish and 3 barra, not one was a keeper, we paid nearly $4000 and didn't take a fish home, great.' Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business . A 152cm Black Jewfish landed Finniss River 17th June 2013 by Gary Bez from Karratha at head . But Beale told Daily Mail Australia they had set off for Sail City to go hunting for sailfish but one person among the group had suffered a sore back during the trip. ‘One of the chaps had a sore back and he couldn’t handle the wave action so I told them that we couldn’t go out there because we needed to look after the client’s best interest,’ Beale said. 'I like to make 100 percent of my customers happy but when it comes to bad weather and body conditions, the reality is - it’s hard to give them that because we can’t control the weather. ‘I knew the wave action from the wind would double in the next two hours and the sailfish would have been around 60 kilometres away so it was definitely out of the question. ‘I explained it to them and they accepted that they couldn’t handle the distance so I gave them two safer alternatives – go black jewfish fishing at Peron Island or travel out to Jenny and Blaze Wide for Spanish Mackerel – everyone picked the Spanish Mackerel. ‘I don’t think it’s fair to make these sorts of allegations towards our business because all we can do is offer the best service as possible.' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business . Darwins Barra Base will offer their clients the choice of Two Levels of Extended Fishing Safaris . Les N added: ‘Alan was the skipper the 1st day, what a miserable moany [sic] guy, all he did all day was tell us how much he was struggling to keep skippers & that his secretary was on stress leave. ‘Sorry mate we needed counciling [sic] after listening to your moaning all day,’ the post continued. But Beale responded: ‘During the day clients ask questions whilst fishing about work, fishing, staff and family and their business. This comment about me moaning about staff issues just shows how little he had to go to, to complain. ‘There are issues in these allegations – they are made up and completely false. ‘And as for the defecation claims – I never defecated and they are pure lies. ‘We don’t have commercial toilets. The truth of matter is, if someone has to go, then we have to go but you've got to do it in a safe matter.’ Beale added: ‘Send us an email and I'll look after you and ensure all the little issues presented in these reviews are better handled for you by me and my staff.’ For more information, please visit darwinbarrabase.com.au.

Video footage has emerged showing a naked Air Force veteran running around his Atlanta apartment complex before police arrived on the scene and shot him dead. In the footage obtained by WSBTV, Anthony 'Tony' Hill, 27, can be seen walking outside the Heights at Chamblee apartment complex, climbing balconies and crawling around on the floor. Police responded to reports that an unclothed man was running around the complex and banging on people's doors. Officers arrived at the apartments just after 1pm on Monday. One witness told WSBTV that he told Hill to go inside otherwise he was going to get arrested. Scroll down for video . Erratic: A video shows 27-year-old Air Force veteran Anthony Hill walking around an apartment complex naked on Monday afternoon; he was later shot and killed by responding police officers . Concerns: Neighbors called police to report the naked man on balconies and knocking on doors . 'He was acting crazy but he was calm like he didn't know where he was,' said the witness, who did not wish to be identified. 'He was like kind of lost in his face.' An officer approached him and Hill turned towards him, authorities said. 'When the male saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer,' said DeKalb County Director of Public Safety Cedric Alexander. 'The officer called on him to step back, drew his weapon and fired two shots.' Witness Oscar Perez told ABC11Alive: 'The man, he was liked drugged, but he was naked and he was crawling. I think the police officer thought he was going to attack, so he shot him.' Hill was shot in the upper torso. The officer, who is white, is a seven-year veteran of the Dekalb County Police Department. He has not been identified. County police chief Cedric Alexander told reporters that the officer had been equipped with a Taser at the time of the shooting. He would not comment on whether the officer should have used the Taser but said that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation would take over the probe into the shooting. Veteran: Police said it was reasonable to assume that Hill, who was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East, was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the incident . Killed: Hill, pictured with his girlfriend Bridget, was shot after he ran at the officer, police have said . Heartbroken: Bridget took to Twitter on Monday to share her anguish over the death of her boyfriend . Shocked: Bridget said the couple had been celebrating three years together on Monday . He added that he could 'reasonably assume' that Hill was possible suffering from mental illness at the time, given his behavior. On his social media profiles, Hill had used the hashtag '#IAmBipolar'. In his final Facebook post on Monday morning, Hill wrote: 'Where i once saw death i only see life.' Social media also shows Hill was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East. His girlfriend, Bridget Anderson, wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'My boyfriend was SHOT AND KILLED today by an officer. HE WAS UNARMED. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. 'I thought cops were suppose to protect and serve???? THEY TOOK THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AWAY!!!!!' She added on Twitter that Monday had been their three-year anniversary. Scene: Hill was shot twice by a white officer at the Heights of Chamblee apartment complex in Atlanta . Dekalb County police chief Dr Cedric Alexander, pictured last year, said the officer was also carrying a Taser . 'Who will I share my secrets with now?' she wrote. 'Who will I call when something good happens? How will I move on from this? Lord give me the strength.' Police forces across the country have come under fire for their use of lethal force, especially against ethnic minorities, the poor and the mentally ill. Mr Alexander added: 'We have already, as many departments have begun to do, look at how do we expand our mental health training. It appears that we're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who may be in distress.' Hill is at least the third African-American since last Friday who has or has appeared to have been unarmed when killed by police. Police near Denver last Friday fatally shot an unarmed man who was a wanted fugitive. On the same day, an officer in Madison, Wisconsin fatally shot a biracial 19-year-old, prompting some 2,000 students to march in the state's capital on Monday. See below for video .

Leicester, England (CNN)Richard III, the King found beneath a car parking lot, has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service, 530 years after his death in battle. The remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of Leicester in August 2012. They have been pored over by scientists at the city's university ever since, but after more than two years of legal wranglings, the bones were finally laid to rest Thursday in a coffin built by Richard III's distant relative, Michael Ibsen, whose DNA helped prove their identity. It was standing room-only at Leicester Cathedral -- which had been partially rebuilt for the occasion -- as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby led prayers for the long-dead King, swinging incense and sprinkling holy water over the casket, before scattering it with earth from key locations marking his birth, life and death. Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch, a distant cousin of England's last Plantagenet King, read a poem dedicated to Richard III, written by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. "My bones, scripted in light, upon cold soil, a human braille. My skull, scarred by a crown, emptied of history. Describe my soul as incense, votive, vanishing; your ownthe same. Grant me the carving of my name." Queen Elizabeth, represented at the ceremony by the Countess of Wessex, sent a special message to mark the reinterment, which she hailed as "an event of great  national and international significance." "Today we recognize a King who lived through turbulent times and whose Christan faith sustained him in life and death," it read. But though it bore many of the hallmarks of grief -- polished coffin, empty tomb, relatives clad in gloomy, pitch-dark suits -- this was not, the organizers insisted, a sad occasion. "This is not a funeral at which we mourn," said Professor Gordon Campbell, of the University of Leicester, welcoming the congregation to the cathedral, just yards from that famous parking lot. Instead, the aim of the service was to offer Richard III a fitting farewell, and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at Bosworth in 1485. Back then, his body was slung over a horse and carried back to Leicester -- legend has it that his head struck Bow Bridge on the way -- before being put on display for three days, to prove to friends and foes alike that he really was dead, before being slung into a hastily-dug grave at the Church of the Grey Friars. Now Richard's bones, accompanied by a specially-crafted rosary, recognizing his Catholic faith, rest in a lead-lined coffin of English oak, his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale Swaledale fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black Kilkenny marble carved with his name, dates, coat of arms, and his symbol: a white boar. Speaking before the commemorations, Philippa Langley, founder of the "Looking for Richard" project, said she did not expect to feel upset at the reinterment: "Richard died over 500 years ago, so I don't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all. I hope there's perhaps some joy, that something has been done well and right and that we've made peace with the past." But Ibsen admitted he found Sunday's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving: "there was a slight dampening of the eyeballs, which caught me completely unawares," he said phlegmatically. "Leicester born and bred" sisters Susan Foster and Sharon Stirling were among the crowds waiting outside the cathedral to listen in on the service and catch a glimpse of the guests arriving. "This is history, isn't it, it's never going to happen again," said Foster. "We grew up with all the stories of Richard III. We lived close to Bow Bridge, so we know all the legends about him." Stirling said she thought the Richard III story would be a big bonus for the city: "I think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he's got quite a fan club, after all." Leicester has always been proud of its links to Richard III; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor, there's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave. But in recent days, interest has risen to fever pitch: shop windows are full of Richard-themed displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail jewelery. The florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses, which people have been leaving at Richard III's statue, and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs, from paperweights and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate. There's even a "Return of the King" beer -- locally brewed and promising "a distinctive regal flavor." Some 35,000 people lined the bunting-and-flag-draped streets of Leicester and its surrounding villages on Sunday to watch as the King's coffin was carried in a procession out to the scene of his death and back again. Another 20,000 lined up for hours to file past the casket and pay their respects as it lay "in repose" at the cathedral in the days since, watched over by an honor guard of veterans. Among them was Jane Gregory, who traveled two hours by bus from her home in South Derbyshire twice in a week to be there. "It was just something I had to see and experience -- it's part of history," she told CNN outside the reburial service on Thursday. "I came on Monday too, to view the coffin -- it was a great experience. I queued for two and a half hours and it was worth every minute." History enthusiast Paul Eames stood in the drizzle and watched the service on his iPad after missing out on a ticket -- to his wife Karen: "I applied for tickets for both of us; I could have cried when I saw the envelope with her name on it." "I didn't originally want to go," Karen admitted, smiling. "But he told me 'you'll be part of history, you don't realize!' The service was amazing, really lovely." Not everyone was there just to celebrate Richard III, though. Leicester student Sherry Xie said she was "proud" of her university's role in the discovery of his bones, but she and her classmate Wendy Jiang admitted they'd come along with an ulterior motive: "to see Benedict!" In his sermon, the Bishop of Leicester, Tim Stevens said those who had joined the commemorations "(came) not to judge, condemn or praise, but to stand in silent, humble and reverent attentiveness at the meeting place of time and eternity." Stevens said the search for Richard III had "broken open not just a car park, but a nation's story." It also provoked bitter quarrels between rival factions over where and how he should be buried, and how much scientific testing he should be subjected to. But Campbell insisted that the service was held in a "spirit of reconciliation," a thought echoed by Stevens: "Whether we bear a white or a red rose, whether for Richard or Henry ... whether for Leicester or York, we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place, where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust." Langley, the driving force behind the search for the King, said Thursday's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long-running saga; but she said work to re-examine Richard's life and legacy would go on. "It's the conclusion to his story in that he's been found ... and we're laying his physical remains to rest. But in terms of Richard's story, that is only just beginning."

He admits it is ‘the biggest gamble of his life’ and is terrified that his latest television venture will be a flop. And it would seem comedian James Corden, who makes his debut this month as anchor of The Late, Late Show – one of America’s top talk shows – may be right to be concerned, according to some members of the test audience at a rehearsal last week. Corden and his new employers, CBS, could be worried that American audiences won’t get his British brand of humour and they want to ensure he is word perfect for his first live show on March 23, when Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks will be a guest. Response: James Corden is to make his debut as anchor of The Late, Late Show later this month - but CBS bosses could be worried about how he will be received, so a  rehearsal was held this week . A source on the programme revealed they needed to ‘iron out the glitches and find out what works’, adding: ‘The US audience is totally different to anything James has experienced before. It’s been a real rollercoaster of highs and lows.’ The Mail on Sunday gained exclusive access to Corden’s rehearsal last week, and while some of the 200 invited audience – many of them professional actors paid to ‘fill’ seats – seemed charmed by his laid-back delivery, most complained that they were ‘baffled’ by his sense of humour and found his estuary accent difficult to understand. Though he told interviewers last week that he intends to ‘shake up’ late-night TV in the US, the new show is surprisingly formulaic. Corden, 36, sits behind a desk topped with an old-fashioned rotary phone, while guests sit on a blue sofa in front of a fake backdrop of Los Angeles. There is a small bar set up in the corner of the studio, staffed by barman Ian, and a house band led by wild-haired musician Reggie Watts. The comic opened the ‘show’ with a monologue of jokes, including one about last week’s scandal over US Secret Service members who crashed into a White House barrier after a drunken party. ‘They’ve got a new motto – to protect and serve me another,’ he told his audience. Guest Susan Wittan, from Rockville, Maryland, who attended Thursday’s rehearsal said: ‘I’d never heard of James Corden until today. 'He seems to be a very friendly, nice guy but I didn’t get some of his jokes and I found him a bit hard to understand at times. He speaks quite quickly and used British words like mate. ‘I enjoyed some of the humour but I’m not sure how well he will go down in America.’ Revolutionary: Despite Corden - seen here interviewing Whitney Cummings, of sitcom 2 Broke Girls, and Eric Christian Olsen, from crime show NCIS: Los Angeles - promising the shake up the tried-and-tested format, some audience members complained there was little to differentiate it from other talk shows . Another woman, Christine, who revealed she was being paid as a ‘seat filler’ said: ‘I don’t think enough people know who he is. I didn’t enjoy the show much. It was boring.’ The dress rehearsal came amid increasing concerns that Corden, who has lost 6st in the run-up to the show’s launch, has been under tremendous stress, doubtless mindful that many other Britons, such as Ant and Dec, and Russell Brand, tried and failed to crack the American audience. While friends and family insist his new, slimline image is the result of a conscious effort to look svelte for his big launch, others close to the show say his fear of failure is the real reason that he has lost so much weight. Risk: Corden has moved his family - wife Julia Carey, son Max, three, and four-month-old daughter Carey - to LA, but admits taking the role is the biggest gamble of his life so far . In recent weeks he has displayed obvious signs of anxiety. ‘There have been a few heated moments,’ the source said. ‘There have been a few raised voices. But that can be normal for any new show. ‘You can’t blame him for being stressed and nervous. His entire professional future is on the line.’ Corden, who relocated to LA at Christmas with wife Julia and their children Max, three, and 14-week-old Carey, is on a reported £1.5 million-a-year deal. He admits CBS has taken ‘a huge gamble’ bringing him to the United States, saying: ‘I don’t know if I’m making a huge mistake. But I’d rather regret doing something than not doing something. ‘It’s madness really. When I got the job I’d never even been on an American talk show.’ Before Thursday night’s rehearsal began Corden, clearly on edge, spoke to the audience. He told them: ‘This is a dream come true for me. If you’d told the 12-year-old me that I would be doing this I would never have believed it.’ He also spoke about his children, saying: ‘When you have one kid it’s like having a pet. When you have two it’s like getting the whole zoo.’ But he appeared distracted at times, with one onlooker commenting: ‘He seemed like he had a lot on his mind. There were times during the moments by himself when he looked stressed and worried.’ He interviewed comedian Whitney Cummings, of sitcom 2 Broke Girls, and actor Eric Christian Olsen, from crime show NCIS: Los Angeles. Both are CBS shows. When Cummings joked about Britain being ‘a nation of alcoholics’ Corden replied: ‘I would refute that although I am aware that I’m the only late-night host with a bar in his studio.’ Family man: Corden told the audience about his newly expanded brood, saying: ‘When you have one kid it’s like having a pet. When you have two it’s like getting the whole zoo.’ Unknown?: Some said they thought Corden was not well-known enough to do well as a talk show host in the States - but CBS have been doing a lot of promotion to spread his name around, like this billboard stunt . Afterwards one British audience member said: ‘The show was pretty predictable. The main difference between this one and the other American late-night shows is that the guests walked out and sat on the sofa together. It’s more like Graham Norton’s show in format. ‘There were skits and jokes and a house band. He made the effort to engage the audience and invited everyone up on to the stage at the end to dance. 'But there’s nothing revolutionary about it. He’s likeable but won’t win any originality awards. He was trying very hard, though. The tone of the show is sweet.’ Amelia Darwin, who also watched the show, added: ‘James Corden worked really hard and is a likeable man. But I’m not sure he’s got what it takes to be a huge success here. The show is too similar to everything else out there. 'I wish him well but I won’t be tuning in.’ Nick Bernstein, CBS Vice President, Late Night, West Coast said: 'The studio audience reception to the practice shows has been terrific. 80% of the audience has re-booked for a future taping. A late night host with an accent is hardly a foreign concept to CBS. We find James British accent quite charming.'	Corden due to make his debut as anchor of The Late, Late Show this month . But dress rehearsal to gauge reception has revealed problems . Audience members complain British actor's accent is hard to understand . Others said it was 'boring', with nothing to make it stand out from the rest . Corden and his young family relocated to LA so he can host the CBS show . But 36-year-old has admitted the job is 'the biggest gamble of his life' The above article has been amended since it was originally published.
If rollerskates are too retro and skateboarding too restrictive, there’s a new hydrid vehicle to master. The Post Modern Skateboard is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and allows riders to perform effortless-looking spins... with a lot of practice. It comprises two 10-inch wheels, which riders position their feet inside, instead of balancing on a conventional board. Scroll down for video . The Post Modern Skateboard (pictured) is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and allows riders to perform effortless-looking spins... with a lot of practice. The wheels can be joined together with a pole, to make the experience more like skateboarding, or kept separate, to be used more like in-line skates. ‘The annular skates… are propelled by leaning side to side, allowing you to skateboard without having to push off the ground,’ according to the entry in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue. ‘Riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side-to-side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet, propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to longboard skateboarding.’ The wheels can be joined together with a pole (pictured), to make the experience more like skateboarding, or kept separate, to be used more like in-line skates . When the wheels are connected by a metal pole, the toy is most similar to a casterboard (pictured), which is a narrow, flexible skateboard with a metal 'spine' and two wheels that can travel in any direction . Composition: Two 10-inch wheels, which riders position their feet inside. The wheels can be used independently as skates, or joined with a metal bar to form a 'board'. How to use it: Annular skates are propelled by leaning side to side, to let a user skateboard without pushing off the ground - like using a casterboard. Tricks: When the toy is used like inline skates, riders can perform 720° spins. Price: $100 (£67) When the wheels are connected by a metal pole, the toy is most similar to a casterboard, which is a skateboard with two wheels that can travel in any direction. ‘The included extendable rod can be connected to both wheels, providing stability to novices and hastening the learning period,’ the catalogue says. When the wheels are not connected and work more like inline skates, ‘riders can easily perform 720° spins and turn on a dime’. Riders stop by placing their toes on the ground. The wheels of the ‘board’ measure 10 inches in diameter (25cm) so that it can be used on uneven road surfaces and grass. It costs $100 (£67) and is designed to be used by ages eight and upwards. ‘Riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side-to-side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet, propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to  skateboarding,’ the catalogue says . A motorised skateboard with just one wheel has been created by a firm in San Francisco. Called the Onewheel, the $1300 gadget has a single air filled tyre taken from a go-kart. It can reach speeds on 12mph (19km/h), and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board - all while balancing itself using the same motion sensing technology found in a smartphone. A motorised skateboard with just one wheel has been created by a firm in San Francisco. Called the Onewheel, the $1300 gadget (pictured) has a single air filled tyre taken from a go-kart . The firm behind it, Future Motion says it 'lets you fly over pavement on only a single wheel'. 'Onewheel represents a huge shift in the typically stagnant, technology starved world of boardsports,' said Kyle Doerksen, who invented the board. Riders can accelerate up to 12mph (19km/h) by leaning towards their front foot. Leaning back slows down, or even reverses, and regenerative braking recharges the battery during deceleration. Mr Doerksen says riding one is like flying. 'The first thing you'll notice when you get on Onewheel is that it's simultaneously familiar and unlike anything you've ever ridden. 'The technology enables it to ride much more smoothly than a skateboard and carve turns like on snow or a surfboard.'	Post Modern Skateboard is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates . Riders position their feet inside two 10-inch diameter wheels . Wheels can be connected with a pole to be used as a skateboard . Allow users to perform pirouettes when they are used as inline skates . Post Modern Skateboard is on sale for $100 (£67) and is suitable for 8+ .

‘Toxic’ pollen from GM corn can travel miles to contaminate the countryside, researchers claim. Currently, European Union regulators assume pollen from the crop, which has been manipulated to include a toxin that kills pests, can travel only 20 to 40 metres. However, research suggests that significant amounts of the pollen, which harms butterflies and moths, can be carried up to 4.45 kilometres – 2.7 miles – on the wind. Watchdogs have launched an investigation into GM corn following a study showing ‘toxic’ pollen from the plants can travel miles to contaminate the countryside . Critics say that if this is correct the rules must be redrawn to protect the countryside and stop the pollen contaminating conventional and organic farms and food over vast areas. The European Food Safety Authority is now reviewing the approval process for the corn – known as Bt maize – following the German study. Its investigation is particularly important because the European Commission is in the final throes of approving a type of GM maize that was assessed under a safety regime that did not take account of the new information. The researchers measured the spread of pollen from maize crops over ten years at hundreds of sites in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They discovered that assumptions that maize pollen is heavy and falls to the ground over a short distance from the plants were spectacularly wrong. The research found the concentration ranged from 23.3million grains of pollen per square metre close to the fields to 2,857 grains at greater distances. Significant amounts of pollen were found more than 2½ miles away. Previous assumptions on pollen dispersal were based on the premise that the air was still, but the German researchers pointed out that these conditions are ‘practically non-existent’ in the real world. They said some studies suggest that the pollen can be lifted high in the air by strong winds and carried for more than 40 miles. The experts, whose research was published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe, said even small amounts of pollen containing the toxin – as little as four grains – will harm or kill sensitive butterflies and moths. The European Food Safety Authority is reviewing the approval process for the corn – known as Bt maize - following a research study by German academics, while one environmental group called for it to be banned altogether . They concluded that measures would be needed to ensure any GM maize crops are more than half a mile away from sensitive areas of countryside which are home to important populations of butterflies and moths. Mute Schimpf, of Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ‘The only logical and scientific conclusion is to halt the cultivation of all GM maize in Europe.’ Last month, MPs on the science and technology select committee said the term ‘GM food’ should be abandoned because it had become a ‘lightning rod’ for fears about designer crops. Anti-GM groups accused MPs of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public.	New evidence shows spread of GM pollen cloud is enormous .

A train passenger was brutally attacked by a gang of thugs after he refused to let them try on the top hat which has become his 'trademark' because he wears it every day. Jacky Pautonnier was returning home from a dinner party when he was accosted on the train platform by a man pestering him to try on his hat. When he refused, the yob went and fetched two friends, who followed him onto the train and beat him unconscious before stealing his beloved headgear. Assault: Jacky Pautonnier was left with horrific injuries after he was attacked by thugs on a train . Horrific: Mr Pautonnier, a French e-cigarette seller, refused to let one yob try on his 'trademark' top hat . Mr Pautonnier, 56, had to undergo reconstructive surgery to repair multiple fractures on his face after the horrific assault, which took place last month on a train between Catford and Charing Cross in London. The French e-cigarette salesman said: 'It's awful. I have been so sad without my top hat. We had spent the day eating cheese and I was tired so I went home alone. 'I was wearing my top hat and this guy carrying bags of spirits pestered me on the platform. 'The guy said, "Hey mate, can I try on your top hat?", but the way he asked me wasn't very nice. Usually it wouldn't be a problem but I said no and he wasn't very happy.' Ten minutes later, the thug returned with two friends, and they taunted him again on the platform then boarded the same train as him. Surgery: Mr Pautonnier had to undergo an operation to repair the damage to his face . Injuries: The victim's skull was fractured in three places around the eyes and nose . 'The three guys sat behind me and started to tip my hat and I said, "Can you stop please?" but he came and sat next to me,' Mr Pautonnier said. 'Then I got up and one of the guys pushed me against the carriage door and said, "You are getting on my nerves, why won't you let me wear your hat?" 'I tried to calm him down but I blacked out here, I lost consciousness.' The father of two woke up at Charing Cross in a pool of blood before taking the Tube home to Canada Water in south-east London and going to sleep. When his partner Jennie Allen arrived home she convinced him to go to hospital, where X-rays revealed that he had fractures below his left eye, on his nose and on the top of his left eye. Gruesome: The scene on the train after Mr Pautonnier was beaten up and left unconscious . Suspects: Police are trying to speak to these three men over the assault on Mr Pautonnier . Mr Pautonnier, who is president of the Association of London Normans, bought the hat for £45 in 2008 from the Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street after his son Alex said it suited him. Alex, now a 24-year-old chef in London, convinced his father to wear it to work the next day and Mr Pautonnier went on to make a habit of it. 'I wore it to work and everybody commented that it suited me,' he said. 'I've worn it ever since and it has become my trademark. 'I feel sad without it. I've got another one but it's just not the same.' British Transport Police released surveillance camera footage of three men they wish to talk to following the assault but are yet to make any arrests. Investigating officer Stephen Allen said: 'I am keen to speak to the men in the CCTV images as they may hold vital information to my investigation and I urge them to come forward.'

Two teenage boys have been caught on film performing a dangerous stunt on a speeding commuter train in New Zealand. The boys, who risked their lives to hang off a train carriage in New Zealand, were spotted outside Manor Park Station, north of Wellington, on Sunday afternoon. Footage of the pair’s brazen stunt was posted on Instagram and is now circulating on the internet. Police and rail authorities have condemned the reckless behaviour. Scroll down for video . At speeds of over 90kmh the unidentified teenage boys could have easily fallen to their death during the crazy stunt . Police shift commander John Spence said police were astounded by ‘the crazy stunt’ that could have easily killed the boys. "Falling off a train travelling at 90kmh would have led to serious if not fatal injuries," he told NZ media. The pair abandoned their joy ride before the train reached the next station. KiwiRail zero harm manager, Aaron Temperton, said the train could have been travelling at up to 90kmh, a very dangerous speed when people are outside the carriage. Wellington Metro trains can reach speeds of 110kmh. "It is hugely irresponsible. People can die and have died from things such as this. We cannot understand why they would put themselves in harm's way," Mr Temperton told NZ media outlets. Shocking: Police and rail authorities are shocked by the crazy stunt which was caught on film . He said anyone participating in behaviour like this could be prosecuted for trespassing and slapped with a massive fine. KiwiRail Metro manager, David Shepard, reminded everyone that actions like this can have consequences for a number of people, including staff and other commuters. "Trespassing on the rail corridor is a huge problem and people who do this, whether it's being on the rail corridor or riding on the back of a train, run the risk of not only killing themselves but also traumatising the people who then have to deal with the consequences of their actions," he said to NZ reporters. Not cool: Rail authorities say other commuters and staff could have been traumatised if the stunt went wrong . The video footage was captured by Alexey Zhavoronkov while he was with his family on the road between Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt. He slammed the pairs behaviour wanting to set a good example for his son who also witness the act. "We're originally from Russia and this kind of madness is more like normal there ... it was a shock to see people here doing it. It's really dangerous ... it was scary," he told NZ reporters. The footage has been handed to police and they are searching for the unidentified teens. Last year the number of reported incidents of trespassing on the rail corridor rose from 288 incidents in 2013 to 418. The stunt constitutes trespassing the perpetrators could be slapped with a hefty fine and criminal conviction .	Two boys have been caught on film dangling from rear of a train carriage .

Airlines are changing procedures to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times following the Germanwings tragedy that killed 150 people. It dramatically emerged today that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 that crashed into the French Alps locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane. The final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said it was 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz's plan to 'destroy the plane'. Now budget carrier EasyJet has announced the move will come into force tomorrow - and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across airlines. Scroll down for video . Disaster prevention: Budget airlines EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle will introduce new rules to ensure two crew members are in the cockpit at all times in the wake of the Germanwings air disaster . Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board . Safety: Now budget carrier EasyJet has announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines . Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet . The move comes after the Civil Aviation Authority urged airlines to review their policies to avoid the pilot or co-pilot being alone at the controls. An easyJet spokeswoman said: 'easyJet can confirm that, with effect from Friday 27 March, it will change its procedure which will mean that two crew members will be in the cockpit at all times. 'This decision has been taken in consultation with the Civil Aviation Authority. The safety and security and of its passengers and crew is the airline's highest priority.' EasyJet said a cabin crew member will temporarily enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet. The airline will not have a third trained pilot on board. And a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'We always ensure we have the highest safety standards and, while it is our common practise to have two members of our crew in the flight deck at all times, in light of recent events we are now in the process of formalising this to be policy.' The change is also being implemented by package tour operator Thomas Cook, whose spokesman said: 'We are adapting our procedures to ensure there will always two people in the cockpit.' An aviation industry insider said: 'There is some industry chatter about the policy becoming mandatory.' Budget airlines Ryanair, Monarch and Jet2, which flies from airports in the Midlands, North and Scotland, said they already had policies to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times. Ryanair said it already operates a policy requiring two people in the cockpit 'at all times'. Its spokeswoman said: 'If a pilot needs to visit the bathroom the cabin crew supervisor is required to stand in the cockpit for these brief periods.' Risk management: Pilot Europe's third largest budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle has also announced the same move for 'safety reasons' Doomed: The captain of the ill-fated flight - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter (file photo) Monarch's spokeswoman added: 'We also have an 'eyes-on' rule requiring cabin crew to enter the cockpit during the cruising stage to check on the pilot and co-pilot.' A Jet2 spokeswoman said: 'This rule has been in place for a number of years to ensure the safety and security of our customers.' While a FlyBe spokespman said their Operations Manual 'states that two members of crew are to be present in the cockpit at all times during flight'. British Airways and BMI Regional declined to comment, while Ryanair were unavailable. Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures. 'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence. As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually. 'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards. 'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.' His parents only discovered that their son was a mass murderer minutes before the dramatic press conference by prosecutors in Marseille. 'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually . Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in Le Vernet near the French Alps today, as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives . Rescue: Helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered . Safety procedure: Budget airlines Ryanair, Monarch and Jet said they already had policies to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times . 'When one person leaves the cockpit, two people will now have to be there,' Norwegian's flight operations director Thomas Hesthammer said. Long haul flights usually have more than two crew capable of flying the plane because shift changes are often required in flight. A spokeswoman for German carrier Lufthansa, parent company of Germanwings, said: 'A crew member may temporarily leave the cockpit during a specific phase of the flight. 'So far, no decision has been taken to change the procedure as it is already approved by the German office of federal aviation but we will look into it. So far, we trust our procedure. It also transpired today that the Germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the Alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and 'burnout'. Mr Lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in Seyne today -  postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was 'in depression'. Airline bosses confirmed Lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was '100% fit to fly'. Raid: German police have investigated Andreas Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf . Killer's home: A French prosecutor in Marseille said Mr Lubitz's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the French Alps . German police have since raided Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf. At an extraordinary press conference earlier, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box. He said Lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck. At that point, Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually - and deliberately. He said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. Earlier in the flight, Mr Robin said Lubitz's responses were initially courteous, but became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane. The captain - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter. Mr Robin said: 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit.'

(CNN)It shouldn't come as a surprise that Yemen has collapsed -- again.  A country that has split and been pulled together before, has the youngest and fastest growing population in the region, is running low on oil and water, and possesses a "personalist" government rather than stable institutions, was on the top of every expert's list as the fragile state most likely to fail next. What is surprising is that U.S. policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply drone-bombing al Qaeda terrorists could keep Yemen intact and stable. Indeed, last fall, when President Barack Obama pointed to U.S. policy in Yemen as an example of a "success" and a model for the plans that would roll back the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), I shivered. For as September ended, Shi'ite Houthi rebels from the north moved south and took the capital city, Sanaa. By January, the Islamic State was noticeably increasing its recruitment in Yemen, and that same month the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for organizing the deadly Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Last week, the Islamic State bombed two Shi'ite mosques in Yemen, killing more than 130 worshippers at prayer.  This week, the Houthi forces are closing in on Yemen's second major city,  Aden, on the south coast, and the U.S.-supported President, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has reportedly fled the country. As the United States has closed its embassy and withdrawn its last troops, Yemen has slid into total chaos, with rebels and jihadists on both sides capturing military bases and seizing tanks and heavy weapons. The situation is so dire that a coalition of Sunni nations, led by Saudi Arabia, has launched massive airstrikes against the Houthis, with a Saudi adviser threatening to bring up to 150,000 ground troops into Yemen to restore the Hadi regime. Yemen does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability. These include legitimate leadership with stable succession plans; a united elite; institutions to bridge regional and ethnic divisions and assure fairness in political and economic access and a functioning economy with capabilities for providing employment and growth. Rather than working to secure these things, the U.S. administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove "dangerous elements" will sustain broader social and political stability. Anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in Yemen and that aerial attacks on al Qaeda terrorists would have no effect on them. Those attacks were a sideshow -- like firing a lousy band performing on the deck of an ocean liner, while a hull full of holes is taking on water fast. What we have now is an area with about 24 million people, more than twice the population now under the rule of the Islamic State in eastern Syria and western Iraq, that is virtually ungoverned and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all-out civil war between Iran-supported Shi'as and al Qaeda/ISIS-aligned Sunnis. It is a war that the West loses no matter who wins. It is now too late to do much of anything except watch and try to either support any moderate elements if they should emerge as capable of holding regional or national power, or contain any dangerous jihadist elements if they should do so. Either task will be difficult, and provide yet another costly distraction to efforts to restore peace in Syria and Iraq. In other words, what has happened in Yemen, although predictable, is about the worst outcome imaginable for U.S. policy.  That America ever deluded itself into thinking airstrikes were enough to deal with the problems of failing states in the Middle East and North Africa -- and the crisis of ISIS -- is a notion that could only be made more frightening if it keeps on doing it.

A woman who uploaded a brutally honest 'Marriage CV' to the internet after discovering her parents had posted a profile of their daughter on a dating site has become a feminist hero. Indhuja Pillai, 23, from Bangalore, couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the account that her well-meaning parents had created in order to find her a husband. Indhuja, who works at the internet company Tripigator, decided to build her own description, with a no-holds-barred description of her likes, dislikes and general demeanor and posted it on a blogging site. Indhuja Pillai, 23, from Bangalore, created a marriage CV online after her parents tried to find her a husband through a dating site . Speaking on her blog about the profile her parents created, Indhuja said: '[The] details were, name: Indhuja, profession: Software Engineer. 'I went like, "WTF is happening here," because, I am no g***amn software engineer and I'm only 23! 'I am [not a] woman desperate to get married, and that matrimony profile made me look like one.' Indhuja took the profile down and told her parents that she was going to build her own dating profile, telling them to, 'Send this to anyone who has the nerve to ask my hand in marriage.' The so-called 'Marriage CV' is nothing like any dating profile you would find on a wannabe bride's page and even states that she is interested in men who hate children. The profile reads: 'I wear glasses and look dorky in them. Not a spendthrift or a shopaholic. 'Detest masala & drama, not a TV fan. I don't read. Indhuja's marriage CV . 'NOT a womanly woman. Definitely not marriage material. Won't grow long hair, ever.' Indhuja then went on to describe the sort of man she would be interested in hearing from. She said: 'Looking for: A man, preferably bearded, who is passionate about seeing the world. 'Someone who earns for himself and does NOT hate his job. Extra points to the one who hates kids. 'Points for a great voice and an impressive personality. Should be able to hold a conversation for at least 30 minutes.' She added: 'If you think you qualify, I recommend you re-think. If you are sure, I suggest you show this website to your parents. 'If you're still sure, try imagining a life with someone like me.' After just 48 hours, the CV went viral, with people from as far away as Australia and Canada picking it up. Indhuja says that the response to her piece has been overwhelming . Indhuja is now being hailed as the face of modern India - a woman who's not afraid to challenge traditional perceptions of femininity and womanhood. And her blog post has touched a nerve in the same week the BBC plan to air India's Daughter, a documentary exploring the attitudes to women that formed the background for the brutal gang-rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus in 2012. Filmmaker Leslee Udwin, who made the programme which will show on BBC4 on Sunday, March 8, was disturbed that the men who perpetrated the crime barely seemed to realise they'd done anything wrong. The bus driver Mukesh Singh said: 'A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy.' While one of the laywers for the men, told  Udwin: 'We have the best culture. In our culture, there is no place for a woman.' Yet despite this, Indhuja's gutsy marriage profile was met with widespread support. In a follow-up post she revealed the impact of her marriage CV. 'For starters, people like genuine guts. They respect confident and free women, in the right way,' she wrote. 'Many women could relate to the plight of their parents pestering them to get married. And men, without a choice, could only dream of marrying someone like the woman in the profile, me.' And it's clear from comments on the site that Indhuja articulated the frustrations held by modern women in India trying to juggle their hopes and ambitions with  the expectations of their traditional parents. One commenter writes: 'I am just 20 and is already being pressurized to start "looking" (from orthodox muslim family here) and I am holding out on my own. 'But IF I ever consider going the marriage route, I think I'll just get inspired by you and create something like yours to sieve out the ones I'd want to ever get married to and to scare off the kind I'd rather avoid! :D' Another says: 'I'm too 24, and seriously, all this "do-you-have-a-boyfriend/are-you-marriage-material etc etc etc",the list goes till infinity,haunts me at nights!! 'Why can't the society accepts us,THE TOMBOYS,as the way we are!!'	Indhuja Pillai's parents created a dating profile to find her a husband . The 23-year-old from Bangalore took the profile down and created her own . The brutally honest account of her likes and dislikes went viral .
