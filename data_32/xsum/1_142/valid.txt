A selection of baseball-related tweets were featured in the ad, which was shown during the live coverage of baseball's season-ending World Series. However, text appeared so quickly in the lively sequence that some took to the web to express bewilderment. The ad was made to promote "Moments", which highlights trending stories on the social media platform. One Twitter user tweeted, "That Twitter commercial was *really bad*. Can't imagine anyone feeling invited to use the service or see the value after seeing the spot." And blogger John Gruber described it as "incomprehensible", going so far as to say: "Someone should be fired." Some were positive about the broadcast, though. "That Twitter commercial is pretty cool," tweeted one viewer. Twitter has recently been struggling to continue to attract large numbers of new users to its network - a problem which some say is because of the slightly esoteric nature of the platform. "I'm a baseball fan [â€¦] I've been on Twitter since 2007 and to be honest I had trouble making sense of it," said digital entrepreneur George Nimeh, at the Berlin School of Creative Leadership. "I can't imagine what it would be like for someone who is unfamiliar with what Twitter really is. It was really fast, it was kind of a mish-mash of different stuff." Mr Nimeh added that while Twitter's user figures showed strong year-on-year growth a few years ago, that growth had slumped to less than 20% early in 2015. "I think Twitter's fundamental problem is they've never been able to very simply and succinctly explain to people who are not familiar with Twitter what it is - and this particular ad this commercial does nothing to help," he told the BBC.	The first television advertisement campaign by Twitter has left some American viewers confused.
Media playback is not supported on this device The New Zealand-born flanker was part of the Scots' 36-20 win over Italy in Rome, their first Six Nations victory in two years. "Hopefully now that the pressure is off a bit, we can really express ourselves in our last two games against France and Ireland," Hardie said. "I think we can now look to end on a couple of really good wins." Hardie scored his side's second try as Vern Cotter's men put an end to a nine-match losing run in the Six Nations with victory in the Stadio Olimpico. He believes putting that losing streak behind them will give the squad a confidence boost. "We were never too far away," the Edinburgh back-row explained. "We were just one or two performances away from opening this Six Nations up. "We tried to stay positive. We knew we were close to a big display and it is great to get that pressure off our shoulders. "I'm really proud of how the boys did on Saturday. The defence was solid and the attack was really good too. I loved it. "We're good enough to win these next two games and really push on. "If we do that I will be really happy with how we are progressing as a team." Greig Laidlaw delivered a man of the match performance in Rome, contributing 21 points with the boot. Media playback is not supported on this device Hardie says it was not only Laidlaw's near-flawless goal-kicking that helped Scotland to victory, but the captain's leadership when the Italians applied the pressure to move within six points in the second-half. "Tempers flared a bit in the last 10 minutes but that's rugby. "It was a heated game and Italy were at home - they were always going to make it hard. "But we came and weathered the storm and ended up running away with it. "Greig's leadership in those final stages was so important. I came into this environment last year and already I've built up so much respect for the guy. "He has been so good to me and I've really enjoyed playing under him. I listen to everything he says."	John Hardie says Scotland can finish off their Six Nations campaign with victories over France and Ireland.
The president scrapped sanctions implemented 11 years ago against former President Charles Taylor. Taylor is now in a  maximum-security prison for a series of war crimes. President Obama said that Taylor's imprisonment meant that sanctions were no longer necessary. He said that he and his allies now had a "diminished ability" to "undermine Liberia's progress". National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said that the US wanted to congratulate the people of Liberia "for their determination, ingenuity and commitment to peace and democracy" that has made the lifting of sanctions possible. Taylor and his inner circle fuelled a brutal 1991-2002 civil war in Liberia that killed tens of thousands of people. He was arrested in 2006 and charged by a UN-backed court with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for acts committed by rebels in Sierra Leone who he aided and abetted. The Special Court for Sierra Leone trial was held at The Hague in case it sparked renewed unrest in West Africa. Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in jail for what judges described as "some of the most heinous crimes in human history". The former Liberian leader is now being held in a maximum-security British prison. Liberia has been led by Nobel Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf since 2006. She has worked closely with the West in tackling Ebola.	The US has lifted economic sanctions against Liberia as President Barack Obama praised the country's commitment to democracy since the end of the 2003 civil war, the White House has said.
A new scheme called Flood Re has been designed to cut bills for those whose homes are in danger of flooding. Up to now, thousands of householders have been paying large additional premiums to make sure their homes and possessions are protected. About 350,000 homes could benefit - although thousands will be excluded. The cost will ultimately fall on ordinary policy-holders, who will pay an extra Â£10.50 on their premiums on average. As many as 15,000 homeowners made insurance claims for storm and flood damage last winter. Insurance companies should now be able to lower premiums, as they can pass on the flood risk element of policies to the reinsurer Flood Re. Householders who are eligible will also see their policy excesses - the amount they have to pay towards a claim - capped at Â£250. Previously, some people had to pay several thousand pounds towards repairs. However, houses built since 2009 will not be covered by the scheme. This was done to discourage developers from building on land at risk of flooding. Businesses are also excluded, as are landlords who take out insurance policies on homes they do not occupy themselves. The scheme has also been criticised by a group of climate change experts, who said it did not offer good value for money. "It achieves very poor value for money because it is trying to subsidise the costs of flooding, rather than addressing the causes and trying to prevent flooding in the first place," said Daniel Johns, head of adaptation on the Climate Change Committee (CCC). Initially 17 insurance companies are taking part in the scheme.  If necessary, they can pass on any flood risk to Flood Re, which has been funded by the insurance industry as a whole. Its costs will be covered by an industry levy of Â£180m a year. Most insurance companies are expected to pass on that cost to their customers, raising average bills by around 2%. But Brendan McCafferty, chief executive of Flood Re, said flood-risk consumers should benefit from greater choice and more competition. "This should make flood cover more affordable and accessible to those in high flood risk areas over time," he said. However, consumers will not need to contact Flood Re directly, as this will be done by existing insurance companies. Shira Kimmerling, whose home in Hebden Bridge was flooded on Boxing Day 2015, was previously unable to afford insurance. But she told the BBC that, under the Flood Re scheme, she would now be able to pay for cover. "I think it's wonderful news," she told the Today programme on Radio 4. "But after all, it's not a very sustainable and cost-effective plan in the long term. We need to invest in flood resilience." Those who have already taken out household policies are being advised by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to talk to their providers. If they want to switch to a cheaper policy, they should ask if it is possible to avoid cancellation charges. But the ABI also said there was no rush to change policies immediately. One of the firms taking part, Axa Insurance, said it would embark upon a proactive contact campaign "to ensure that the impact of Flood Re for the most exposed is felt as soon as possible".	Homeowners living in high flood-risk areas of the UK should now be able to save hundreds of pounds on their insurance premiums.
Police were called to Ridley Road in Dalston at about 14:10 BST following reports of shots being fired. Armed officers found a man in his 30s with a gunshot wound to his leg. He was taken to hospital and is said to be in a "serious but stable" condition. Police searched the area and recovered a firearm. They also made 13 arrests for a variety of offences. Ridley Road has been closed while the police carry out their investigation.	A man has been shot in the leg and 13 people arrested following an incident in east London.
He is credited with the BJP's win in the recent election in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. He replaces Rajnath Singh, who is the home minister in the new government. A controversial politician, Mr Shah is accused of sanctioning the killing of a Muslim civilian in 2005, when he was the home minister of Gujarat state. In 2010, Mr Shah resigned after he was charged with murder and kidnapping of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and arrested in connection with the killing. He spent more than three months in jail after which he was released on bail. Mr Shah denies the charges. Mr Shah, a general secretary of the BJP, was chosen its new president by the parliamentary board consisting of top party leadership on Wednesday. Announcing his appointment, the outgoing chief Rajnath Singh said Mr Shah was chosen unanimously by all members of the board. The 49-year-old is reported to be one of the youngest presidents of the party. He has a reputation for being a good organiser - in the run up to the general election, he was appointed to head the BJP's campaign in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh where he helped the party win an unprecedented 71 of the 80 seats for the party. During the campaign, the Election Commission barred him from addressing rallies after finding him guilty of giving "hate speeches" against the Muslim community. The ban was lifted after Mr Shah apologised and promised not to "use abusive or derogatory language". A long-time member of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, Mr Shah has known Mr Modi for more than three decades. Correspondents say his appointment to the top post will give Mr Modi complete control over the party and the government.	Amit Shah, a close aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been appointed the chief of India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Until now the product - which suggests "answers before you ask" - had been limited to devices running Google's own Android operating system. Unlike the original version, Google Now only works within the firm's Search app on Apple's iOS platform - potentially limiting its appeal. One analyst suggested the launch indicated that the firm's priority was securing the widest audience possible. "Google is going to put its technologies onto other platforms whenever it can draw people into its services," said Brain Blau, consumer technology research director at the consultants Gartner. "They do want to entice people to buy Android devices, but they know not everybody's going to, and they still want to deliver their services - especially for people who are already using their products on iOS." iOS powered 29% of smartphones sold in Great Britain between December and February, according to fresh data from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. It said Android accounted for a further 58% of the market. Google Now works by offering "cards" filled with information designed to be useful to a smart device user without them needing to type in a search request. It works by accessing the machine's location data, and analysing the contents of the person's Gmail and Google Calendar records as well as their past Google searches. Examples of the results given include: Those worried about privacy issues can restrict which information is stored and used. The cards are accessed by swiping up the bottom section of the Google Search app's screen, and the user can then scroll through a selection of the various categories generated. The facility could potentially draw users away from using Apple's own personalised search tool, Siri, which relies on users instigating a request. However, the fact that it involves more screen presses to access Google's information could discourage some from using it. "The big difference is that Google Now isn't limited to the search product when used on Android - it's connected to the OS [operating system]," said Mr Blau, referring to the fact that the Android version can be activated by a single button press and be set to bring up high-priority card alerts when the app is not open. "So there's a big user interface difference and they may have different usage patterns and interaction paradigms because of that." A comparison chart posted online by Google also shows that the iOS version of Google Now only offers 21 of the 29 types of cards available on Android. Missing categories include Nearby Events which brings up concerts and other shows; Research Topic which offers web page suggestions based on earlier searches; and Fandango which reminds a user when they need to leave home to arrive at a cinema in time for a pre-booked show and then brings up their electronic ticket when they arrive. Several tech sites, including Cnet and The Next Web, have reported that the search firm might next bring the Google Now service to its Chrome browser and possibly its search webpage based on analysis of changes to the firm's code. More will be revealed when the company hosts its annual Google I/O developers conference in San Francisco between 15 and 17 May.	The Google Now service is being extended to Apple's iPhones and iPads.
Goals from Zlatko Junuzovic, Florian Grillitsch and Florian Kainz condemned second-placed Leipzig to their second successive league defeat. Bayern can extend their 10-point lead when they travel to Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday. Borussia Dortmund closed the gap on Leipzig to three points with Friday's 1-0 win at Ingolstadt. Hoffenheim are a point further back, and boosted their chances of a Champions League place with a 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen. Having begun their first Bundesliga season with a record 13-match unbeaten run, Leipzig's title challenge has collapsed following four defeats in seven games, taking just seven points. Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste scored a hat-trick as Cologne beat fifth-placed Hertha Berlin, to take his league total to 22 for the season. At the other end of the table, a Mario Gomez goal moved Wolfsburg out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over bottom club Darmstadt. Match ends, SV Werder Bremen 3, RB Leipzig 0.

Bridgend county council wants to knock down Malc's Cafe in Rest Bay, to make way for the new modern facility. Porthcawl Civic Trust Society has objected to the two-storey building saying it was "out of accord" with the area's character. Councillors have backed it but said traffic plans must still be agreed. The proposals were being considered by the council's development control committee on Thursday. The council hopes the building - with public toilets, changing rooms, a new cafe/bistro, function room and covered dog walkers' area - will be used by water sports clubs. Residents said the plans would increase parking problems, late-night noise and anti-social behaviour, and the height of the building would impact on the "unspoilt" appearance of the coastline. The council said: "If successful, the water sports centre and cafe at Rest Bay will provide new high-quality facilities near the award-winning blue flag beach while establishing an iconic, contemporary attraction capable of supporting and developing sports and leisure activities in the area." Approving the proposals, the committee has imposed a number of conditions in a bid to ease the public concerns. The centre will not be allowed to operate after 21:00 in the evening and staff parking, turning area and delivery yard plans must be agreed. The council said a traffic management plan for the development must also be submitted and approved before construction can get under way.	Plans to build a new water sports centre in Porthcawl have been approved, despite concerns it could spoil the coastline.
The centre scored two tries as Warriors thrashed the Dragons 47-17 to keep their faint hopes of a top-four finish alive. "I think we have to win all of our games and we can do it," said Kiwi Grigg. "Confidence is key and, with five points today, we're on the rise." After a sticky opening period in which they fell 10-0 behind, Glasgow came storming back with seven tries to blow the Dragons away and secure an important bonus-point victory at Scotstoun. Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was pleased to see his side end a three-match losing run in the Pro12. "We got into our attack flow pretty well," he told BBC Scotland. "When you're moving the ball so much, there will be mistakes, but we were working out where best to target in the Dragons defence. It was also fatiguing them as a side. "Defensively, we just weren't in place in those first 10 minutes and they deserved their lead, but we showed really good resilience. "The switch went on at 10-0. We won the kick-off back, got into their 22 and then eventually scored from the scrum. "It was pleasing. I thought, individually, guys stood up really well. We showed the ambition we like to show when we play here." Townsend echoed Grigg's assertion that Glasgow can still overcome the odds to make the top four but admits they will be relying on the teams above them to slip up even after collecting five points against the Dragons. "We could do with a 10-pointer one week," Townsend joked. "We know we've got a lot of catching up to do and we'll probably have to rely on the teams above us losing. "We'll have to rely on teams like Scarlets and Ulster to slip up and we'll have to get on a really good winning run. "This is an exciting part of the season. We've got Connacht here in three weeks' time, a massive game against the champions. "Then we have a run of Saracens away (in the Champions Cup quarter-final), Munster away two weeks after that. "We'll have more players available and they'll come back (from Scotland duty) full of confidence."	Glasgow Warriors can still make the Pro12 play-offs but will need to win the last five games of the regular season to do so, says Nick Grigg.
Sixfields Tavern became engulfed in flames at about 14:30 GMT on Saturday afternoon. Eighty firefighters worked for five hours to contain the fire and no-one was hurt. Minor demolition work is to be carried out, as police and firefighters assess the damaged site. Barry Mullan, incident commander, said: "The local employees did a great job in getting everyone out." He said the fire began in a rear compound which contains a bin store and walk-in freezer, although the exact cause is not yet known. Firefighters remain at the site watching for hotspots, which may reignite as the unstable areas are demolished. The pub is at Sixfields Leisure, a site of shops, restaurants, fast food outlets and a cinema just yards from Sixfields Stadium, the home of Northampton Town. Flames and billowing smoke could be seen above the stands as The Cobblers defeated Northwich 3-2 in the FA Cup on Saturday afternoon. Lewis Dunnachine, who was in the pub, said: "We were finishing off our lunch prior to going to the Northampton Town match when I spotted spotted black smoke before the fire alarm went off. "Our seats at the game enabled us to watch the building burn to the ground." The game was unaffected and police assisted as supporters left the ground at full-time. At the blaze's peak, firefighters were supported by crews from Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. The operation was scaled down after 18:00 GMT. A smell of burning lingers in the area where this time yesterday, Sixfields Tavern was a busy restaurant and pub. It's now a carcass, burnt beyond all recognition. Part of the front of the building is still standing but from what I can see through the broken windows the inside is damaged beyond all reasonable repair. It's a sad sight. This was a popular local and the pub of home fans on match day. Police advised people to avoid the area on Saturday night and said Weedon Road roundabout remained closed on Sunday. A Hungry Horse spokesperson said: "The pub will not be open for the foreseeable future and we will be working with the emergency services to establish the cause." They added: "We sincerely apologise to our customers who have Christmas bookings with us, and will be contacting those whose telephone numbers we have as soon as we can to help them re-arrange their bookings, or where necessary, offer a refund of their deposits." The venue was fully-booked for Christmas Day lunch. James Stirling and Brian Miller were working at the pub when the fire took hold. They described it as heartbreaking. "I've already cried," said Mr Miller. It is understood pub workers have been unable to collect their cars from the car park because their personal belongings, including keys, were in the staff room.	Staff at a fire-wrecked pub in Northampton have been praised by a fire officer for their quick actions in helping customers to safety.
Samir Hussain suffered severe burns and was scarred for life in the unprovoked attack in the Cineworld car park in Crawley, West Sussex, in August 2015. Michael McPherson, 28, from south-west London, threw the acid after leaving a screening of Straight Outta Compton. At an earlier hearing at Hove Crown Court, he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Lee Bates, also from south-west London, was with McPherson at the time of the attack. He admitted common assault in February, and was given a two-year conditional discharge for his role in the attack. Mr Hussain, 29, from Redhill in Surrey, still has to wear a mask to protect his face, and has had several skin grafts. He suffered severe burns to his face, neck and right arm.	A man who threw sulphuric acid into the face of a shop worker outside a cinema has been jailed for eight years.
And with economic wobbles around the world - like here in China - George Osborne dramatically warned today that he might have to make further spending cuts when he stands at the despatch box on 16 March. It's just been confirmed that the size of the British economy is smaller than had been thought, and Britain is - however mildly - very likely to be affected by the slowdown in other countries. The chancellor wants to keep to his self-imposed rule of getting the books into surplus by the end of the Parliament. He could relax that rule and slow down the pace of the cuts but that's not what appears to be on his agenda. Instead, it seems he'd rather find the money somewhere. He wouldn't say where he'd look for cuts, but you can assume departments ministers have already pledged to protect will be safe from further austerity. That of course means potentially tighter squeezes elsewhere. Mr Osborne ruled out significant tax rises and don't anticipate that he is looking to make dramatic increases to the level of cuts. He said his first target will be further efficiencies in Whitehall. But there is no sign whatsoever that the chancellor and this government will be able to leave behind the spending squeeze that defined so much of their early years in charge.	If coping with internal struggles over the European Union wasn't enough, the government has a Budget to contend with within the next three weeks.
It has told AMs that almost 40,000 hours were "lost" in 2014 because of so-called "handover delays". Its report indicates that is up from around 8,000 hours lost in 2008. The ambulance service's chairman also said its "long-standing and complex problems" were now being tackled. He was giving evidence to the assembly's health committee, as it began a short inquiry into the performance of the ambulance services in Wales in the light of recent concerns about its performance. Any wait longer than 15 minutes to transfer patients into hospital is logged as a handover delay, often caused when emergency unit beds are full. The ambulance service says the delays not only present "risks to patients waiting in vehicles" but are "arguably a greater risk" to patients "in the community". That is because when crews are tied up outside A&E they are not able to respond to other urgent calls, which can mean no ambulances are available. Research by the BBC also suggests the ambulance service in Wales, during a four-month period last autumn, faced consistently longer delays than anywhere in England or Northern Ireland. Between August and November last year the Welsh Ambulance Service reported the longest "average handover time" for 13 weeks of a 16-week period. In 10 weeks out of the 16, the Welsh Ambulance Service also had  the longest single delay of any recorded by the 11 ambulance services that provided information. The maximum recorded wait for an ambulance patient in Wales exceeded five hours in three of the weeks. Those delays occurred at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan and Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The report to the assembly's health committee suggests handover delays are contributing to problems the ambulance service is encountering in its response time performance. The most recent statistics published last week showed that only 48.5% of urgent Category A calls received a response within eight minutes in January. The target is 65%. But other factors, the evidence suggests, are at play: Addressing the committee, ambulance service chairman Mick Giannasi listed actions being taken to overcome "long-standing and complex problems", including a "significant" improvement to industrial relations with staff. "We absolutely acknowledge that the performance of the emergency ambulance service in Wales is not acceptable, particularly not in terms of its achievement against the eight-minute response times target," he said. "We accept progress is slow, but we passionately believe now that I think our plans will deliver," he added. Meanwhile, the author of a review into the ambulance service said improvements were taking longer than she wanted. Prof Siobahn McClelland called for major changes when she published her findings, commissioned by the Welsh government, in 2013. She said some of her recommendations were being introduced in an NHS that was a  "very complex organisation that is sometimes very slow to change". Before the committee meeting, a Welsh government official commented: "We expect all patient handovers to be completed in order of clinical priority and in a timely manner. "Health boards should take responsibility for reducing lengthy patient handover delays. We continue to monitor the situation closely."	Patients could be at risk because there's been a five-fold increase in delays faced by ambulance crews outside hospitals, according to the Welsh Ambulance Service.
The victim, who is in his 40s, sustained head injuries in the attack outside a licensed premises in Flax Street at about 05:25 BST. He was taken to hospital and a police spokesman said he is "said to be in a critical but stable condition". Det Insp Heather Whoriskey appealed to anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward with information.	A man is critically ill after he was attacked by a number of people in an overnight assault in north Belfast.
The Fox Valley shopping centre at Stocksbridge, north Sheffield, started construction more than two years ago. It has been built on the 28-acre former Outokumpu steelworks site. The development, which features a large mural by local artist Pete McKee, was opened by the actress Joanna Lumley. McKee has also collaborated on a large bronze statue called Granddad Fox at the site. Samuel Fox founded a wireworks in Stocksbridge in 1842 and the name has been adapted by the new centre. The artworks feature umbrellas as the site was a base for their manufacture. More than 100 houses are also being built on a neighbouring site. The site close to the A616 Stocksbridge bypass has been developed by Dransfield Properties Ltd, with a further phase to be opened in September.	A £50m shopping centre has opened on the site of a former steelworks creating up to 900 jobs, according to the developers.
Ipswich Town left back Tyrone Mings, 22, published a text message exchange between him and his mother on his Instagram account. His mother thanked him for wiping "all my debt away", with Mings replying she deserved "every penny" and saying: "This is why I do it." A club spokesman said it was a "private matter between Tyrone and his mum". The player won praise on the social networking site, with one person calling him a "hero" and someone "who all children should look up to and aspire to become". It is not the first time the footballer has expressed his generosity. Last July, Mings offered via Twitter to buy new shirts for fans who had his old squad number stamped on their new kits. Four months previously, he gave  two match tickets to a fan after he complained he had no money. Mings, who comes from Bath, joined Ipswich Town in 2013 after the manager saw him play for just an hour with non-league side Chippenham Town. He has been linked with a big money move to Premier League giants Arsenal.	A footballer who has become known for "great gestures" has now seemingly paid off his mother's debts.
Its survey of 1,600 cities in 91 countries revealed that nearly 90% of people in urban centres breathe air that fails to meet levels deemed safe. The WHO says that about half of the world's urban population is exposed to pollution at least 2.5 times higher than it recommends. Air quality was poorest in Asia, followed by South America and Africa. "Too many urban centres today are so enveloped in dirty air that their skylines are invisible," said Dr Flavia Bustreo, the WHO's assistant director-general for family, children and women's health. "Not surprisingly, this air is dangerous to breathe." Health risks The WHO currently sets safe levels of air quality based on the concentration of polluting particles called particulate matter (PM) found in the air. It recommends that levels of fine particles called PM2.5 should not be more than 10 micrograms per cubic metre on average over a year, and slightly larger pollutants, called PM10, should not reach more than 20 micrograms per cubic metre on average. But the Urban Air Quality database showed that many areas were breaching these levels. Some cities in Asia showed extremely high levels of pollution. Peshawar in Pakistan registered a PM10 level of 540 micrograms per cubic metre over a period of two months in 2010, while Delhi in India had an average PM2.5 of 153 micrograms per cubic metre in the same year. Cities in South America, including Rio De Janeiro in Brazil, also fared badly. But the WHO says it is still lacking data, especially from cities in Africa, where poor air quality is a growing concern. The most recent figures suggest that seven million people around the world died as a result of air pollution in 2012. It is estimated that 3.7 million of these deaths were from outdoor air pollution. The WHO calls its the world's single largest environmental health risk, and links poor air quality to heart disease, respiratory problems and cancer. "We cannot buy clean air in a bottle, but cities can adopt measures that will clean the air and save the lives of their people," said Dr Carlos Dora from the WHO. Follow Rebecca on Twitter	The World Health Organization says air pollution in many of the world's cities is breaching its guidelines.
He has made 155 appearances for the Lions since signing from MK Dons for an undisclosed fee in January 2014. The 30-year-old played 56 games in all competitions last season. "Having such success last season made it an easy decision for me to sign another contract," Williams told the club website.	Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams has signed a 12-month contract extension with the newly-promoted Championship club, with an option for an extra year.
The government allowed councils to increase council tax by 2% this year to spend on care - and most have done so. But, according to a survey of all 151 social care directors, there is still a shortfall of nearly £1bn. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services said councils had no option but to reduce the services. Directors in charge of care for older people and adults with disabilities indicated in the annual survey only about half of this shortfall could be met by efficiency savings. Instead, they said, 39% of the shortfall would have to be covered by cuts to services, with those provided to the elderly most at risk. This could lead to day centres being closed, fewer hours of help being provided in people's homes and an increase in rationing resulting in a cut in the number of people actually getting services, the ADASS said. The rest of the savings will be met by other measures, such as increasing the fees people are charged - unlike with NHS services, people can be asked to make a contribution to the care they get. ADASS president Harold Bodmer said: "We have been arguing for some time that adult social care needs to be given the same protection and investment as the NHS. Services are already being cut, and the outlook for future care is bleak. "We are at a tipping point where social care is in jeopardy." £19.7bn will be spent on care services in 2016-17 £13.8bn will come from council funds - 1.2% more than last year £5.9bn will be raised from charges, the NHS and other sources £940m short of what is needed The funding councils get from ministers for services has been cut this year. But, to help protect social care in particular, Chancellor George Osborne gave them permission to raise council tax by up to 2% if the income was to be used for care services. He said this would put the sector on a sound financial footing after years of budgets being squeezed. But the ADASS survey indicates that despite 95% of local authorities raising council tax, there is still a shortfall in the budget. Directors said £13.8bn had been set aside for social care in 2016-17 - a 1.2% increase in cash terms on the previous year. Another £5.9bn is expected to come in from other sources, such as fees people pay and the Better Care Fund, a separate pot of money largely funded by the NHS, to which councils have access. But that still leaves the sector £940m short, the survey indicates. ADASS said this was because of the increasing pressures from the ageing population and the cost of meeting the National Living Wage, which was brought in in April and is estimated to cost councils more than £600m this year. Richard Humphries, of the King's Fund think tank, said the findings should be of "huge concern". But a Department of Health spokeswoman said the council tax precept would raise more money in time - local authorities can increase it by 2% each year this Parliament. She added: "We know that protecting services while delivering the necessary efficiencies is challenging which is why we are working with local government to support councils to make savings."

The match had been set for 24 January at Seaview but now a new venue and date will be arranged by organisers. Linfield lodged an appeal against the County Antrim FA's decision to play the final at Crusaders' Shore Road venue. The match gives David Healy the chance of a first trophy since taking over as Linfield manager in October 2015. Under Northern Ireland's record goalscorer, the Blues have lost in Irish Cup and Shield finals and also finished runners-up in the Irish Premiership last season. The most likely date for this season's Shield decider is Tuesday, 7 February and the choice of venue appears to be between the Oval in Belfast or the Showgrounds at Ballymena. Meanwhile, Glenavon have confirmed that they have signed defender/midfielder Aaron Canning from Championship club Loughgall until the end of the season.	The County Antrim Shield final is to be held at a neutral venue after Linfield challenged a decision to stage it at the ground of opponents Crusaders.
On Tuesday, Brazil's Attorney General Rodrigo Janot asked the Supreme Court to authorise an investigation against Ms Rousseff for obstruction of justice. Mr Janot also accused the former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of involvement in the scandal. Lula has denied any wrongdoing. The allegations were based on evidence given by Senator Delcidio do Amaral, who as part of a plea bargain agreed to testify against other suspects after being arrested last year. President Rousseff described Mr Amaral as a compulsive liar. "The accusations made by Senator Delcidio do Amaral are absolutely irresponsible and above all false," Ms Rousseff told journalists in Brasilia. "He has lied repeatedly since his arrest. He first accused Supreme Court judges. Than he reneged on those comments and he is now accusing me. I believe the Senator's credibility is rather precarious," she said. The allegations come as Ms Rousseff is already under immense political pressure. Senators are expected to vote next week on whether to start an impeachment trial against her over separate allegations. She is accused of illegally manipulating the federal budget ahead of her re-election in 2014, which she denies. If the Senate votes in favour of the trial going ahead, Mr Rousseff will be suspended for 180 days. Mr Janot also asked the Supreme Court to authorise an investigation into Lula for alleged corruption, accusing the former president of playing a key role in the Petrobras scheme. He said the corruption could not have taken place without the participation of the former leader, who served as Brazilian president between 2003 and 2011. He requested authorisation to investigate Lula and 29 other senior politicians, officials and businessmen. Prosecutors say the corruption scheme is estimated to have cost the company more than $2bn (Â£1.45bn). Part of the money, they say, was used to finance the electoral campaign of top Brazilian politicians. Several politicians, Petrobras executives and businessmen have been arrested and sentenced as part of the two-year investigation. Ms Rousseff served as the head of Petrobras for much of the period when the corruption took place, but she has not been implicated in the scandals.	Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff says accusations that she tried to block a major corruption investigation into state-owned oil company Petrobras are "false and irresponsible".
Researchers say the huge predator had scales much like modern reptiles rather than feathers or fluff. The dinosaur may have ditched its feathers because it no longer needed insulation when it reached gigantic proportions, they propose. But the findings are unlikely to end the long-running debate about the physical appearance of T. rex. We don't need to throw out the image of a big fluffy T. rex quite yet, argued one palaeontologist. Whether T.rex was clad in scales, feathers or both, has long been a mystery, largely due to a lack of fossil evidence. Primitive feathers have been identified in some members of the Tyrannosaur group, leading to speculation that the king of reptiles also sported feathers. In the latest twist, researchers analysed skin impressions from a T.rex skeleton known as Wyrex, unearthed in Montana. They also looked at relatives that roamed during the Late Cretaceous in Asia and other parts of North America, including Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus. Skin patches from the neck, pelvis and tail of Wyrex show scaly, reptilian-like skin, says a team led by Dr Phil Bell of the University of New England, Australia. Writing in the journal, Biology Letters, they say fossil integument (outer covering) from T.rex and other members of the group confirm that "these large-bodied forms possessed scaly reptilian-like skin.' The researchers think the giant tyrannosaurs lost their feathers over time because they no longer needed them as insulation. But not all researchers are convinced. Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh said he wouldn't be surprised if T. rex lost or reduced its feathers, as it was a very big animal, just like elephants reduce their hair. Asian elephants are hairier than African elephants because they are smaller and live in dense forests in dim sunlight. "But I don't think we can assume that T. rex lacked feathers just because some fossil skeletons have skin impressions that are scaly," he added. "It takes inconceivable good luck to preserve feathers in fossils. Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they weren't there. So I don't think we need to throw out the image of a big fluffy T. rex quite yet." The Tyrannosaurs were fearsome predators during the last part of the Cretaceous, 85 to 65 million years ago. They were known for their sharp teeth, small beady eyes and tiny forelimbs (arms). The group included Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus, as well as the iconic T. rex.

The senior brother had previously been moved out of Rubane House, where he abused young boys, and became principal of a school in Downpatrick. The details were revealed at the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry. It is examining allegations of abuse at Rubane House in Kircubbin. About 200 former residents have made allegations of abuse. The inquiry also heard the De La Salle Religious Order paid compensation to victims who were sexually abused at Rubane House within years of the order ruling that a previous investigation into their abuser was "best forgotten". The HIA has been told that one victim, then aged 12, arrived at Rubane House in 1961. Three years earlier, in 1958, the order launched an internal inquiry into claims of sex abuse against the brother in charge of the home. The order subsequently ruled that "no reference is to be made at any time or to anyone regarding the inquiry". However, the senior brother continued to sexually abuse boys at the home. The order later paid the victim £27,500 in compensation. Another victim, who was in the home from 1958 to 1960, was paid £20,000 in compensation earlier this year. Junior counsel to the inquiry, Joseph Aiken, opted not to read out the contents of a statement the man made to police in 2010. Mr Aiken invited the inquiry panel to adjourn to take time to read the statement which he described as "graphic". The inquiry also heard the victim "subsequently abused his own children". Rubane House was open from 1950 to 1985. A total of 55 former residents have come forward to the inquiry to allege that they were physically or sexually abused. The sex abuse allegations at Rubane House ranged from watching children in the shower to rape, while physical abuse ranged from corporal punishment to serious assault. The HIA inquiry was set up in 2013 to investigate child abuse in residential institutions in Northern Ireland over a 73-year period, up to 1995. The Rubane House allegations form the third module of its public hearings. It had previously been examining what happened to children sent from Northern Ireland to institutions in Australia.	The De La Salle religious order moved a serial sex abuser to Africa, in 1982, despite being aware of his crimes at a boys home in County Down.
Cheshire Police released the statistic as they launched a campaign to urge male victims to report abuse. Officers said they were raising the issue in the run-up to Valentine's Day, "when relationships are at the forefront of everyone's mind". Information about help will be in GP surgeries, community centres, shops and sports centres. Assistant Chief Constable Phil Thompson said: "Domestic abuse knows no boundaries and it can happen to anyone at any time regardless of gender, age and sexuality. "Men in particular find it hard to speak out if they are being abused, but we want to reassure anyone who may be suffering at the hands of another, that domestic abuse is an issue that we take extremely seriously - whatever time of the year. "Traditionally the emphasis has been on female victims of abuse but it is important to highlight the fact that many victims of domestic abuse are also men. "By bringing this important issue to the front of people's minds we hope that it will encourage any men to have the confidence in contacting us if they want to end the cycle of abuse."	One in five victims of domestic violence in Cheshire is male, police have revealed.
It comes after police in Shandong announced last month they had arrested a mother and her daughter accused of buying and selling vaccines illegally. The estimated $88m (Â£61m) worth of vaccines were not properly refrigerated or transported. The illegal vaccine ring, said to have been in operation since 2011, has sparked widespread anger in China. The scandal has led to a crackdown, with checks ordered on vaccine makers, wholesalers and buyers. The vaccines were bought from a variety of sources, both licensed and unlicensed, then sold on to both illegal agents and legal local disease control and prevention centres at inflated prices, reported the Xinhua news agency. The ring is alleged to have involved hundreds of people across 20 provinces, it said. Though authorities had known about it since April last year, they only made the news public late on Friday when they issued a call demanding that suppliers come forward to help them trace potential victims. The delay has angered many people in China who questioned why the authorities had not alerted the public earlier. Local authorities have now been given a deadline of Friday to identify who bought the medicines. Three pharmaceutical companies are being investigated, Xinhua reports, citing people handling the case. One, Shandong Zhaoxin Bio-tech Co, has been ordered to suspend operations, it added. The China office of the World Health Organization (WHO) said vaccines needed to be handled properly or they can become less effective. But it stressed that improperly kept vaccines did not in themselves present much danger. "It is important to note, however, that improperly stored or expired vaccine seldom if ever causes a toxic reaction. Therefore there is likely to be minimal safety risk in this particular situation,'' the WHO said.	Thirty-seven people have been arrested in eastern China over a huge vaccine scandal, state media report.
The road closed for a time last week after a landslip during Storm Frank. It closed again on Monday amid concerns about the boulder, which is about 175m above the carriageway. The Old Military Road diversion, which was in use since 09:00, closed at 16:30. An alternative diversion via Dalmally will be in place overnight. In a statement, roads operator Bear Scotland, said that efforts to make safe the boulder had been been "ongoing since first light this morning". "A helicopter bringing materials to site was delayed reaching the area due to inclement weather but the specialist teams have now begun to install the anchors required to remove the boulder safely," Bear said. "Good progress has been made and preparatory works should be completed today ready for works to make safe the boulder to take place tomorrow morning." Bear said the "monitoring process cannot continue safely during the hours of darkness and the Old Military Road will close at 4:30pm this evening and reopen at 9:00am tomorrow". During this time, the diversion via Dalmally and Crianlarich will be reinstated. Overnight, the A83 will remain open from Inveraray to the B828 junction, allowing continued access to Lochgoilhead, Dunoon and the ferries to Gourock. At the south side of the closure, access is available from Tarbet to Ardgartan.	The A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll has been closed overnight as efforts continue to make safe a 150 tonne boulder on the hillside.

The Institute for Science and International Security says images of the Yongbyon plant show patterns of melting snow indicating new activity. Yongbyon's reactor was shut down in 2007 but was restarted in 2013. Six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme have been stalled since early 2009. The think-tank's report says that its assessment in late 2014 was that the reactor at Yongbyon, in the country's west, had been "shut down or partially shut down" but more recent images suggested the plant "may be operating at low power or intermittently". As well as the patterns of melting snow, the satellite photos are also said to capture a stream of warm water coming out of the reactor's discharge pipeline and steam rising off the turbine. This study is a powerful reminder that North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has not gone away. It also shows the important role that independent analysts with access to civilian satellite imagery can play in helping to publicise what previously would have been top secret material available only to a handful of governments. The winter snow and ice provides a helpful environment to reveal tell-tale signs that the Yongbyon reactor may have restarted. There's still considerable uncertainty about the scale of North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Recently Chinese nuclear experts provided their US counterparts with a new assessment of North Korea's nuclear capabilities suggesting it may already have 20 warheads with the capacity to double this total by next year. US estimates are much more conservative. It means that over the past 12 years Pyongyang has developed an expanding arsenal which many see as a significant threat to the region. In 2008, North Korea walked away from six-party talks with South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia on its denuclearisation. The other countries have since tried to persuade North Korea to return to the negotiating table. Earlier this year North Korea offered to stop nuclear tests if the US stopped holding military drills with Seoul, but the offer was rejected. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Also on Thursday, Russia said the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had cancelled his plans to attend World War Two victory commemorations in Moscow. The visit next week would have been his first trip abroad since taking power three years ago. However, a Kremlin spokesman said Mr Kim had decided to stay in North Korea due to "internal issues".	A US think-tank says satellite pictures taken earlier this year suggest North Korea may have restarted one of its nuclear reactors.
The 16-year-old was in woodland, between Howitts Lane and Howitts Gardens, in St Neots, at about 17:30 BST, when he came off his bike. He suffered serious injuries to his neck and wind pipe, Cambridgeshire Police said. He was rushed to Addenbrooke's Hospital where he remains in a serious but stable condition. Det Con Diane Tomlinson said: "The young man is in a serious condition in hospital and I would like to speak with anyone who may know why the rope was tied to those trees, or who may have put it there. "Anyone who uses the area, such as dog walkers, who may have information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, should call police."	A teenage motorcyclist was seriously injured when he came off his bike after hitting a rope tied between two trees.
He was convicted of contesting crimes against humanity. The former Front National chief was convicted of the same charge in 2012 after saying France's Nazi occupation had been "not particularly inhumane". France has strict laws against Holocaust denial. Mr Le Pen told a journalist his remarks "corresponded to my thought that the gas chambers were a detail of the history of war". Asked if "millions of deaths" could be called "point of detail", Mr Le Pen said: "It is not a million deaths, it is the gas chambers. I'm talking about specific things. I have not talked about the number of dead. I spoke of a system. I said it was a detail of the history of warfare." As well as remarks about the Holocaust, Mr Le Pen said in 2014 that the Ebola virus could solve Europe's "immigration problem". He was expelled from the party he founded last year by his daughter Marine Le Pen, the current leader, over his extreme beliefs. In 2015, Ms Le Pen was acquitted of inciting hatred after comparing French Muslims to the Nazis who occupied France during the war.	Former French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has been fined 30,000 euros (Â£24,000; $34,000) for calling the Nazi gas chambers a "detail" of World War Two.
Solomona scored 40 tries in the 2016 season, including a record total of 40 in Super League. Tigers chairman Steve Gill said in October that the 23-year-old Samoan was not for sale and would be returning to the club on 7 November. BBC Sport understands Solomona has held talks with rugby union side Sale. The Premiership club declined to comment on the story.	Castleford Tigers are to take legal action against winger Denny Solomona after he failed to return to the club for pre-season training.
