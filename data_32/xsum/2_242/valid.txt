Andy Carroll poked home his sixth goal in six matches, and Mark Noble added two penalties to put the hosts 3-0 up. The first spot-kick was awarded after Jose Holebas felled Diafra Sakho, and Almen Abdi brought down Michail Antonio for the second after the break. Sebastian Prodl hooked one back for Watford and they also earned a late penalty, but Troy Deeney saw it saved. And in the final minute of injury time, Hornets winger Nordin Amrabat was sent off for picking up his second yellow card. The Hammers remain sixth in the Premier League, still three points behind fifth-placed Manchester United after their 2-0 win over Crystal Palace. Liverpool also beat Everton 4-0 on Wednesday and are two points behind West Ham in seventh. Watford remain 12th and will now focus on Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley against Palace. Both sides have had their fill of penalty action this week. Carroll scored one for the Hammers before they conceded a late spot-kick and equaliser against Leicester on Sunday. And Watford earned a 1-0 victory over West Brom on Saturday - their first win in seven league games - largely thanks to Heurelho Gomes' two penalty saves. However, Gomes was not able to save his side for a third and fourth time in 135 minutes of play. Noble slotted both penalties home with ease, after Carroll had given the Hammers the lead by poking in from close range after a pinpoint ball from Dimitri Payet. Watford got in on the action late on, when Angelo Ogbonna was adjudged to have brought down goalscorer Prodl in the area, but Deeney - on as a second-half substitute - was denied by Adrian. West Ham came up against a much-changed Watford side, as manager Quique Sanchez Flores kept seven first-team players rested for Sunday's trip to Wembley. And the Hammers dispensed of the Hornets with ease to earn a new club record. Slaven Bilic's side have now gone 15 games without losing at home in the Premier League - their last defeat at Upton Park coming against Bournemouth on 22 August. The record came in the third-from-final game at Upton Park ahead of the Hammers' move to the Olympic Stadium. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "We can say they had half of their mind on the weekend and they rested players, but their line-up still had internationals. Media playback is not supported on this device "We are victims of our success as the bar is always rising. We are coping with that well. This game was a big one because I told the players 'the season is good or very good anyway but after this game are we going to look up and try to catch those teams'. Still we have to look down as Liverpool are in good form." Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: "The application was very good from us. We conceded really early and then it was very tough to play against a tough team like West Ham as they had confidence. "In the second half, we reacted really well but not good enough to reduce three goals. Media playback is not supported on this device "We have used a lot of players recently and the plan was to try to conserve and be fit for the weekend. Practically all of the players will be fit for the weekend." West Ham travel to West Brom on Saturday, 30 April, while Watford make the short journey to Wembley for the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace on Sunday.

The total population is now estimated to be less than 500 breeding pairs. The situation is even worse south of the border where the iconic bird of prey is said to be heading to the brink of extinction. The latest survey found 460 breeding pairs in Scotland in 2016 compared with more than 500 when the previous study was carried out six years earlier. The RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Scottish Raptor Study Group, along with a range of other UK partners carried out the survey. It found Scotland remained a major stronghold for hen harriers, with 80% of the UK population. However, having a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 birds makes the species vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and, in some areas, wildlife crime. The west Highlands continue to provide a home for the majority of Scotland's breeding harriers, while Orkney and the Hebrides were the only areas of the country to show a slight increase in the number of the birds. A major project aimed at maintaining their population has also been carried out at Langholm Moor in Dumfries and Galloway. Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: "The hen harrier is an indicator of the health of our upland environment, and the fact that its population continues to decline is of major concern. "The hen harrier is a high priority for our conservation work and urgent steps need to be taken to tackle illegal killing of this species and to improve their moorland breeding habitats." Eileen Stuart, SNH's head of policy and advice, said the decline was a "serious concern". She said they were committed to working with others to tackle wildlife crime throughout the country. "There is a very concerning trend of a long term decline in the number of breeding hen harriers in Scotland," added Wendy Mattingley of the Scottish Raptor Study Group. "For the population to begin to recover and expand over all suitable habitat, the intensively managed grouse moors of east and south Scotland must produce successful breeding hen harriers again. "The hen harrier is a wonderful spectacular raptor and more action must be taken to ensure that its future is secure." Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, said the decline was disappointing but said it would be working to better understand the reasons behind poor breeding and help to rebuild the harrier population. Simon Wotton, lead author of the study, described the survey as a "monumental effort". "We hope these results will convince everyone in a position to help hen harriers to take positive steps to ensure their protection and rebuild the country's population for people to enjoy for generations to come," he said.	Hen harrier numbers have fallen by 9% in Scotland since 2010, according to the latest national survey.
The seven-hour standoff started after police tried to execute a warrant for the arrest of Korryn Gaines. Gaines, who was armed with a shotgun, was shot dead in her apartment while her 5-year-old son watched. Police said her followers on Facebook encouraged her not to give in. According to Facebook's policies, accounts can be suspended if law enforcement believe individuals are at risk of harm. Police Chief Jim Johnson has said their decision to request a de-activation was based upon the fact Gaines had a gun and a child was present during her standoff with officers. Gaines' social media accounts have been restored. But two videos are missing and are being withheld for violating Facebook's standards - which include a provision against inciting violence. Videos posted on Gaines' Instagram appear to show her talking to her son during the standoff. In one clip, Gaines questions her son about the situation unfolding outside, with a police officer visible through her open door. "What [are the police] trying to do?" she asks the boy. "They're trying to kill us,' he replies. Officers claim Gaines threatened to shoot them if they entered her apartment and that she fired shots several times. Gaines' mother, Rhonda Dormeus, told The Baltimore Sun her daughter ignored pleas to surrender. Ms Dormeus believes she might have been able to help calm her and end the situation peacefully had she been allowed to speak with her. Gaines had a history of mental health problems, including anxiety, her former doctor said in an interview. "I do feel like they didn't want to hurt her," Ms Dormeus said, referring to the police. "But I don't feel like they exhausted all the means of negotiation." The initial warrant for Gaines' arrest related to a traffic stop charge dating back to March.	A woman killed in a police standoff outside Baltimore tried to live stream the siege but authorities successfully had her social media accounts deactivated.
Helen Bailey, who wrote the Electra Brown series, was last seen walking her dog near her home in Royston, Hertfordshire, on 11 April. There has not been any trace of the 51-year-old or her pet despite searches. Her partner Ian Stewart said: "Whatever has happened, wherever you are I will come and get you." Read more on this story and others from across Hertfordshire Northumberland-born Ms Bailey, who lived with her partner, had gone for a walk with her miniature dachshund Boris and had reportedly said she "needed a little time to herself". She was reported missing on 15 April. As well as the teenage book series, she started a blog called Planet Grief after her husband of 22 years drowned on holiday in Barbados in 2011. Officers searching for the author have carried out extensive searches of the local area and checked hundreds of hours of CCTV footage. They have said there is nothing to indicate "foul play"". In a statement, Mr Stewart said he hoped she would hear his message and "listen carefully". "We miss you and Boris so much... We are shattered in so many ways," he said. "You not only mended my heart five years ago but made it bigger, stronger and kinder. "Together we learnt to live with our grief and move forward with our lives but never forgetting. Now it feels like my heart doesn't even exist. Our plans are nowhere near complete and without you there is no point." Ms Bailey's brother, John, said it had been an "extremely difficult time" for her family. Making a direct appeal to his sister, he said: "I know you had said you wanted some time and space and we don't want to intrude on that unless you want us to... All we need is some information that you are OK." Chief inspector Julie Wheatley said it was a "highly unusual case" because Ms Bailey "seems to have simply disappeared". "We literally have no trace of her despite extensive searches and inquiries which have been on-going since she was reported missing," she said. "Whilst this very much remains a missing person's inquiry... as the days and weeks pass we and Helen's family and friends are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare." The force has asked for Ms Bailey, or anyone who knows where she might be, to contact them.	One month after a missing children's author was last seen, her partner has said her disappearance has "shattered" the family.
It meant that Mr Bayrou's centrist party, MoDem, surrendered all three of its cabinet posts within 24 hours. President Macron came to power with a promise to fight political sleaze. MoDem, allied to Mr Macron's La République en Marche (LREM) party, is facing an inquiry into claims that it used EU funds to pay party workers. Defence Minister and ex-MEP Sylvie Goulard was the first MoDem minister to hand in her resignation on Tuesday. After Mr Bayrou said he was standing down early on Wednesday, it became clear that Marielle de Sarnez, European affairs minister, was also leaving the government to take over as head of MoDem in the National Assembly. The resignations were not confined to Mr Bayrou's party. Mr Macron's close ally Richard Ferrand stepped down on Monday, amid unrelated allegations he had used insider information to secure a lucrative property deal for his wife while he was head of a mutual health insurance fund. Mr Ferrand and Ms Goulard have both denied any wrongdoing. However, the allegations have cast a shadow over the new government. It was François Bayrou who outlined details of a bill to clean up politics. Three of the figures brought in to replace the four who resigned were women from civil society rather than politics: The relationship between the outspoken Francois Bayrou and Mr Macron's government has been tense for weeks. The French papers were full of anonymous sources from the president's party denouncing Mr Bayrou as having an "outsized ego" who "stops [them] from governing". "We can't keep moving forward," one said, "when we're always going back every five minutes to check whether Bayrou has made a mess again." Mr Bayrou's departure shows how difficult it can be to prevent scandal, even in those with a well-known political past.  With so many new faces entering parliament this month after a rapid selection process, there's a risk those problems could multiply. The president's party has a clear majority in parliament, even without the support of MoDem.  But having vowed to bridge the left-right divide in French politics, Mr Macron may instead be facing a growing chasm with his centrist allies. The bill to clean up politics included stopping politicians hiring members of their own family, a ban of up to 10 years for MPs and senators convicted of corruption or fraud, and reform of party financing. Mr Macron will no doubt be hoping it quells concerns over his fledgling administration, which faces one of its first hurdles on Thursday when it presents controversial new anti-terrorism legislation. Documents leaked to French newspaper Le Monde have already raised fears amongst civil liberties campaigners it may make France's emergency measures, which give authorities extra powers including the ability to carry out searches at any time, permanent. Interior Minister Gérard Collomb told French newspaper Le Figaro [in French] the legislation would involve four flagship methods: creating protection areas around potential targets, closing places of worship which incite terrorism, replacing house arrest with personalised measures, and placing a judge in overall charge of searches and the resulting documents.	France's Justice Minister, François Bayrou, resigned on Wednesday hours before President Emmanuel Macron announced his new government line-up.
Lawyers told a High Court judge on Friday that both sides had agreed to pause the legal fight for one month. Sir Cliff is suing the BBC and South Yorkshire Police over coverage of the 2014 raid. Lawyers for the singer previously said he had suffered "profound and long-lasting" damage from the incident. Mr Justice Mann, who has been overseeing the preliminary hearings at the High Court in London, indicated that he would review matters in the near future. Sir Cliff was investigated over historical sexual assault allegations, which he denied, and the case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service in June last year because of insufficient evidence. The singer is seeking "very substantial" compensation because he says the coverage of the raid at his apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire, invaded his privacy. BBC editors have previously apologised for distress but have said they will "defend ourselves vigorously". A spokeswoman said the BBC had reported Sir Cliff's "full denial of the allegations at every stage". South Yorkshire Police have apologised "wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused" by the force's "initial handling of the media interest" in its investigation into the singer.	Sir Cliff Richard and the BBC have agreed to try to reach a settlement over coverage of a police raid on the singer's home.
It follows a three year legal battle by Shrien Dewani against returning to the country where his wife Anni, 28, was shot in November 2010. Mr Dewani, from Bristol, denies murder and lost his latest appeal against extradition in March. The couple were held at gunpoint while being driven in a taxi through Gugulethu township near Cape Town. By Andrew PlantBBC News, Cape Town Shrien Dewani is expected to land at Cape Town international airport at 06.15 on Tuesday morning and will then be interviewed under caution, before being charged. He's then expected to be taken to a holding cell before appearing before a judge at Cape Town High Court at about 10:00. He's expected to spend the night at Valkenberg Hospital, a large psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Cape Town. Doctors there will assess whether or not he is mentally fit to stand trial. South African authorities have 18 months to put him on trial - or return him to the UK. Cape Town ready for Dewani trial Timeline: Anni Dewani murder Mr Dewani was thrown from the car. The body of Mrs Dewani was found the next day in the abandoned taxi with a single gunshot wound to the neck. Three men have already been convicted in connection with Mrs Dewani's death. Prosecutors in South Africa allege Mr Dewani ordered the killing of his Swedish national wife. Mr Dewani's legal team still have the option of applying to the European Court of Human Rights, but so far no application has been received. The businessman, from Bristol, is expected to arrive in Cape Town on Tuesday.. Once on South African soil he is likely to appear before the Western Cape High Court where his legal team could apply for bail. If that is refused, he will be taken to the high-care wing of Valkenberg, a psychiatric facility, the BBC's Karen Schoonbee in Cape Town understands. Ashok Hindocha, Anni Dewani's uncle, told ITV's Daybreak that the family would attend the court hearing. "We want to know what happened to Anni. That is it," he said. Anish Hindocha, her brother, added: "We are just focusing on this case at the moment and it is hard to even start making the grieving process final yet because there are so many questions we need answers to. "We hope we get it and now today he is getting extradited and that is one step closer towards what we are seeking for her - that is justice for her." Mr Dewani is being compulsorily detained in the UK under the Mental Health Act after being diagnosed as suffering from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting Mrs Dewani and jailed for life. Prosecutors claimed he was hired to carry out the killing. The couple's taxi driver, Zola Tongo, was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.	A man accused of arranging his wife's killing on their honeymoon is expected to be extradited to South Africa later.
Hosted by CBBC presenter Cell Spellman, the new show will split into two parts, one devoted to new pop music with the other playing number one hits. The 19-year-old called his new posting "a privilege and an honour". The Official Chart will move to Fridays on 10 July to coincide with a new global release day for music. Presenter Greg James will kick off at 16:00 BST every Friday as 45 countries launch New Music Fridays. Spellman made his Radio 1 debut in 2013, standing in for Dan and Phil on Radio 1's Request Show. He presents CBBC's Friday Download and the CBBC Official Chart. Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said: "Radio 1 and CBBC are changing the way radio and TV work together to create great content for young new music fans on their radio and phone. "Cel has proven how influential he is to young audiences and I can't wait for him to start." Spellman said: "The best station on national radio has been responsible for introducing me to so much incredible and varied music over the years, I just hope I can return the favour and help make those car journeys a little more memorable for the listeners with a mix of fun, top tunes and a little bit of cheeky chat!"	Radio 1 has announced a new Sunday show which will replace the current Official Chart slot when it moves to Fridays next month.
Arpad Kore and Bartosz Bortniczak, both 18, and Jordanna Goodwin, Megan Storey, and Blake Cairns, all 16, died in the crash in South Yorkshire. Their car collided head-on with another vehicle on the A630 near Conisbrough on 15 November, 2014. Doncaster coroner Nicola Mundy ruled that each of the five teenager's deaths was accidental. The other car driver was injured. Jonathan Earp was in a car ahead of the Toyota Corolla at the time of the crash. Giving evidence at the inquest, he said when he got to the vehicle all the teenagers except his friend Arpad Kore were unconscious. "He was screaming out in pain and begging me not to leave him," Mr Earp told the court. He said he was unable to open the car doors and held his friend's hand until the emergency services arrived. Ms Mundy said she agreed with collision investigators that the most likely cause of the accident was that Mr Bortniczak took his foot off the accelerator as he negotiated a right-hand bend, causing a classic case of "lift-off over-steer". The car, which had been travelling at about 73mph in a 60mph zone, skidded and was side-on when it hit the Seat. Tests showed the car would have been able to safely take the bend at that speed if the driver had kept his foot on the accelerator. Recording her conclusion, Ms Mundy said: "It was the most tragic of accidents. Five young people, who had their lives ahead of them, losing their lives in these circumstances. "I do not think there were any signs of recklessness. It was a mistake and a high price was paid for it." The crash happened after the five friends met up with two others - Ben York and Jonathan Earp - who were in a Vauxhall Corsa. The court heard there had been an investigation into whether the cars had been racing after one witness, Michael Staton, said he had seen two unidentified vehicles at traffic lights revving their engines and then "set off like a dragster start". Mr York, the driver of the Corsa, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving but never prosecuted. But the coroner said: "I do not think there's evidence of them racing or being reckless on the road." Ms Mundy said she would be writing to Doncaster Council to ask it to consider moving the transition from 60mph to 40mph on the A630 further away from Conisbrough.	A teenager has described how his friend, killed alongside four teenagers in a car crash, begged him for help.
Media playback is not supported on this device It is 25 years since Howard Wilkinson led Leeds to the 1992 title, the year before the Premier League was formed. "I don't think it will last another 25 years," said Wenger, referring to "many promising young English managers". Wenger also defended his players after they were criticised for being too friendly with the Manchester United team prior to Sunday's game. And he offered sympathy to striker Lucas Perez over his lack of first-team action. The Gunners face Southampton in the Premier League at St Mary's on Wednesday, knowing a win will left them above Manchester United into fifth in the table, three points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. To mark 25 years since the last English manager won the top flight, at 19:30 BST on Tuesday a BBC Radio 5 live special asks if an English manager will ever win the Premier League. Wenger, who has won the title three times with Arsenal since taking over from Bruce Rioch in 1996, said: "I don't think it is especially an England problem, it is down to the fact the Premier League has attraction power internationally and today all the big clubs have foreign managers. "Before, many Scottish people have won the championship in England. We have many young English managers who are promising. "The English federation has done a good job in educating coaches and you will see a change in that. "When I arrived I remember there were articles saying foreign managers can never win the championship. "It will change again, I'm convinced, we are at a turning point in English football history and some English managers will win the Premier League." Media playback is not supported on this device Match of the Day 2 pundits Phil Neville and Martin Keown criticised Arsenal and Manchester United players for hugging and laughing in the tunnel before the Gunners' 2-0 victory at the Emirates on Sunday. The former suggested that Nacho Monreal looked like he was "going to a christening". When asked about the incident, Wenger responded: "I understand the pundits are a bit surprised. Ten, 15 years ago that didn't exist but it is an international thing now - you watch Real Madrid versus Barcelona and it is the same. "It doesn't stop making players focused. It is pictures we're not used to seeing but it is part of the modern game. Maybe it happened 10, 15 years ago but you didn't have cameras in the tunnel." Arsenal signed Perez for £17.1m from Deportivo La Coruna in August 2016 but the 28-year-old Spaniard has made just 21 appearances for the Gunners this season, starting only twice in the Premier League. He has scored seven times, including a hat-trick in the Champions League group game at Basel. "He is a top quality striker, I couldn't give him the games he wants and deserves and I feel sorry for him," said Wenger. "Don't take anything away from his quality. I would love to [keep him] if I am the manager but we have to sit down together and see if he has a reasonable chance to play or not." Wenger's contract expires at the end of the season and the club has offered a new two-year deal. However, the 67-year-old has yet to declare his intentions. He has been criticised by some fans, who are unhappy at the club's performance this season. They were knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League by Bayern Munich and are currently sixth in the league table, while they face Chelsea in the FA Cup final at the end of May. It was reported in Tuesday's Daily Telegraph that Borussia Dortmund director of football Michael Zorc has been approached about taking a job with Arsenal. When asked about the story, Wenger said: "What does it mean? Is it someone who stands on the road and directs the player right and left, I have never understood what it means? "I'm not prepared to talk about that, I'm the manager of Arsenal Football Club and as long as I am the manager I will decide what happens on the technical front."	It is only a matter of time before an English manager wins the Premier League title, says Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.
The historic vote on the first day of this year's gathering in Edinburgh draws a line under a row which has split the Kirk for nine years. Commissioners voted by 339 votes to 215 in favour of the move. The decision means that same sex civil marriage will be permitted for ministers. However, they will not themselves be allowed to conduct gay weddings within the church. Last year, the assembly agreed that ministers could enter into civil partnerships. The Very Rev John Chalmers, principal clerk to the General Assembly, said: "We had a debate which made very clear that we were not interfering with our theological definition of marriage and were not going to the place where ministers or deacons could themselves be conducting same-sex marriages. "It is an entirely different discussion. "Today's decision means it will be possible for Kirk sessions and congregations to depart from the traditional understanding of marriage to call not only potentially a minister in a civil partnership but one who is in a same-sex marriage. "In some ways we crossed the Rubicon last year when it was agreed that Kirk sessions could call someone in a civil partnership and for many people what today was about was simply tidying up and making the law of the church consistent with Scots law." He added: "Today I think people came to this decision with their minds on law and practice and not on theology and future practice." Colin Macfarlane, director of charity Stonewall Scotland, said: "Today's result is great news for the Kirk and a progressive move forward. "Empowering ministers to live their lives with honesty and integrity sends a powerful signal to faith communities and society as a whole." Rev David Robertson, Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland, said it was "saddened" by the decision. The decision means the Kirk adopts a position which maintains a traditional view of marriage between a man and woman, but allows individual congregations to "opt out" if they wish to appoint a minister or a deacon in a same-sex marriage or a civil partnership. Any wider consideration of the theological understanding of same-sex marriage will not take place until the Theological Forum presents its report to the Kirk next year. These latest changes will differentiate the church from the Church of England, which bans clergy from being married to partners of the same sex and does not allow gay church weddings. Other topics to be discussed at the six-day assembly include the European Union referendum, corporal punishment of children, climate change and the refugee crisis. Members will also discuss exploring ways of promoting the Church through the internet and social media, including a proposal to develop online congregations. The assembly will also consider changing the date of the gathering to June to allow more young people to attend without disrupting their exams. On Wednesday the Archbishop of Canterbury will become the first head of the Church of England to take part in a debate at the general assembly. The Most Reverend Justin Welby will speak to a landmark report, which proposes that the two denominations enter into a historic ecumenical partnership. At the General Synod in London in February the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Right Rev Dr Angus Morrison, took part in a debate on the Columba Declaration which formally approved the agreement. Dr Morrison said: "We all look forward to welcoming the Archbishop of Canterbury to the General Assembly on Wednesday to speak to the historic Columba Declaration. "It was my privilege to address the General Synod of the Church of England on the same document and by a very large majority the Synod affirmed it. "I am confident that our General Assembly will do so too. "In itself, the declaration is largely of a symbolic nature but it does pave the way for our further growth in fellowship and for extending partnership in mission as sister and national churches who share many common roots, challenges and opportunities." Former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams addressed the General Assembly in 2012 but did not take part in a debate. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon attended the formal opening ceremony in the building on the Mound which used to be home to the Scottish Parliament until 2004. More than 850 commissioners from across Scotland, the rest of the UK, Africa, Asia, North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean have registered to attend. Dr Morrison is to stand down from his 12-month role as moderator and will be replaced by the Rev Dr Russell Barr, the founder of Edinburgh-based homelessness charity, Fresh Start. Dr Barr has announced his intention to use his year in office to highlight the plight of homelessness in Scotland. Speaking after he was elected, the 62-year-old, who is minister at Cramond Kirk in Edinburgh, said he was "excited, honoured and overwhelmed". The Assembly was first held in 1560, the year of the Scottish Reformation which marked the beginning of the Protestant Church of Scotland.	The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has voted to allow ministers to continue to serve if they are in a gay marriage.
Mr Schleicher, who runs the tests, says the high results of deprived pupils in some Asian countries shows what poor pupils in the UK could achieve. The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it "debunks the myth that poverty is destiny". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. "We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty," he says . There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries. "Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries," he said. "It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue."	There is nothing inevitable about the weaker academic performance of poorer pupils, says an analysis of Pisa tests by the OECD's Andreas Schleicher.
The 55-year-old's death is being treated as 'unexplained' by police. Police say they want to trace a woman who may have more information about how the victim came to sustain his head injuries. They also asked for people in the Prince of Wales Avenue and Oxford Road area between 02:00 and 02:30 BST on Sunday to come forward. The woman sought by police is described as mixed-race, 5ft 2ins (1.57m) tall, aged around 35, and slim with long wavy black hair.	A man has died in hospital after being found unconscious inside a property in Reading in the early hours of Sunday.
Reform Scotland said its research suggested more than half of delays to trains in Scotland were due to Network Rail faults rather than ScotRail. It said devolving the organisation would allow a "clear line of accountability" when things go wrong. Network Rail is funded by Transport Scotland but is ultimately accountable to Westminster, not Holyrood. A spokesman for Network Rail said: "We work closely with the Scottish and UK governments to continually enhance and improve our railways. Any discussions over further devolution of Network Rail in Scotland would be a matter for those governments". The full devolution of Network Rail - which is responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure - has been a long-standing ambition of the Scottish government. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said last month that the move would help to reverse "the current unacceptable industry performance" in Scotland. It comes amid ongoing concern over delays and cancellations to ScotRail trains since Dutch firm Abellio took over the contract last year, which has led to Mr Yousaf suggesting that the rail franchise could be taken over by the public sector in the future. Mr Yousaf is to attend a conference on Tuesday alongside Abellio and Network Rail officials aimed at exploring the future of Scotland's railways. In its Track to the Future report, Reform Scotland said 54% of trains which were delayed by more than three minutes had been attributed to Network Rail faults. The report was written by Reform Scotland's research director Alison Payne and Tom Harris, the former Labour MP and UK transport minister. Mr Harris said: "The current debate over whether or not to nationalise ScotRail misses the point. 54% of delays are the fault of Network Rail. Nationalising ScotRail won't make the trains run on time and it is self-defeating for any politician to imply otherwise. "Instead, we need fundamental change to the governance of Network Rail. The Scottish government is responsible for the strategic direction and funding of the Scottish rail network, but this responsibility cannot be properly exercised while Network Rail remains answerable to the UK government. "Reform Scotland believes that Network Rail in Scotland should be fully accountable to the Scottish government, and that means it must be devolved." The report, which examines the modernisation of Scottish railways, also found that journey times in Scotland compared unfavourably with those of a similar distance in England. For example, Edinburgh to Aberdeen and London to Birmingham are roughly the same distance, but the former takes well over two hours and the latter less than 90 minutes. Birmingham and Manchester are 25% further apart than Glasgow and Dundee, but the train takes 15 minutes less to arrive. While it welcomed recent investment in the railways, the report said upgrading lines while trying to use them could cause additional problems and added that investments such as the Borders Railway had been "short-sighted". The new line from Edinburgh to Tweedbank is not electrified and is single-track. The report said the Scottish government should future-proof all new rail investment by ensuring that it is double-track and electrified where possible. And it called for the creation of a "bold and ambitious" Scottish Rail Infrastructure Commission to look into faster rail links for the future, including from the central belt to both the north and the south, and looking at strategic inter- and intra-city rail links within Scotland. The report found that, under current proposals, over the next 30 years people will be able to travel by train from the central belt to London faster than from the central belt to Inverness, despite the former being around 400 miles while the latter is only 160 miles. Mr Harris added: "Ongoing improvements are vital and the Scottish government should be congratulated for investing in this area, but we need to think about the bigger picture and create a bold strategy for the future. "Our rail infrastructure is deficient. We should not tolerate a situation where a resident of Glasgow can get to London faster than she can get to Inverness, because Scotland's cities are too poorly connected."	Calls for the Scottish Parliament to be given full responsibility over Network Rail have been backed by a think tank.
The Premiership club will pay Australian side South Sydney Rabbitohs about £270,000 (500,000 Australian dollars) for the 25-year-old. He will join at the end of the NRL season in October. "With 2015 being a Rugby World Cup, it was an opportunity I had to pursue," Burgess said. "I can't wait to get my head down and start learning the game." The forward played four times in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup as England were beaten by New Zealand in the semi-final. Media playback is not supported on this device England rugby union head coach Stuart Lancaster met Burgess in Australia in August, and sees him playing at centre in the 15-man game. The 2015 Six Nations starts on 6 February, giving Burgess around three months to adapt for that tournament. The 2015 World Cup, which is being held in England, starts in September. Burgess said: "This has been a tough decision for me to make, as I've loved my time in Sydney with the Rabbitohs. However, I'm very excited about the challenge that this move offers me. "An opportunity presented itself to head back home to England and to pursue a chance to represent my country in two different sports." Bath had been under the impression the Rugby Football Union would be responsible for paying for Burgess's release but the RFU initially distanced itself from the deal, conscious of the reaction of the other Premiership clubs. On Monday, however Lancaster revealed the RFU could yet be involved financially, stating: "I think there are discussions ongoing." Bath head coach Mike Ford, a former rugby league player and coach, said: "I've known Sam since his rugby league days in England and he is an exceptionally talented athlete. "I've no doubt Sam will fit in seamlessly here at Bath and we're looking forward to having him join us and start making the transition." Speaking earlier this month, Lancaster said it would be "a challenge" for a rugby league player to make a successful transition into union in time for the 2015 World Cup. But he added: "There's a bigger picture about developing a team that goes way beyond 2015." However former England centre Jeremy Guscott told BBC Sport he would be "surprised" if next year's World Cup came too soon for Burgess to be involved. Media playback is not supported on this device With his move to Bath still eight months away, Burgess vowed he would continue to "do his best every week" for the Rabbitohs, whose coach Michael Maguire said the Englishman had made a "real impact". Burgess, from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, made his Super League debut for Bradford in 2006 and went on to make 79 appearances for the club. In September 2009, the Rabbitohs announced they had signed Burgess on a four-year deal from the 2010 season. Six months ago, he made rugby league history by playing alongside older brother Luke and younger twins Tom and George as the Rabbitohs, whose majority shareholder is actor Russell Crowe, beat Sydney rivals Wests Tigers in an NRL game. It was the first time in more than a century four siblings had played together in a top-flight rugby league match in Australia.	England rugby league forward Sam Burgess is to switch codes and move to Bath on a three-year contract.
Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt made the request following the revelation by the Detail website. It found a report, compiled last May, listed more than 20 ways Brexit could damage Northern Ireland's economy. It  was compiled by officials in the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister. It was not released under Freedom of Information until after the EU referendum was held a year later. The Speaker, Robin Newton, undertook to examine the matter, but he said another assertion by Mr Nesbitt - that not releasing the report was a breach of the ministerial code - was not a matter for him. Alliance Leader David Ford confirmed that neither he or his colleague Stephen Farry were consulted over the executive report on the impact of Brexit when they were ministers in the former Executive. Mr Ford said that if the paper had been made public "perhaps it would have changed some minds in the lead-up to the EU referendum". Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said that agreement was required between the two parties at Stormont Castle before a document of this nature could be published. He said that Sinn FÃ©in had publicly identified the many challenges listed in the Stormont paper. Mr McGuinness claimed the revelation of the paper was a "non story" as the arguments had been made and the Remain camp had won the day within Northern Ireland, even though the UK-wide decision was in favour of Brexit. In Northern Ireland, the majority of voters (56%) voted for the UK to stay in the EU in last week's referendum. But overall, the UK voted to give up its EU membership by 52% to 48%.	The Stormont speaker has been asked to examine Hansard to see if the assembly was misled by ministers over the absence of Brexit contingency planning.
Tentative research published earlier this week suggested repeated headers during a player's career may be linked to long-term brain damage. The research examined the brains of six players renowned for heading the ball - all of whom later developed dementia. The Football Association has said it will look at the area more closely, but is yet to announce its own study. European football's governing body Uefa says the project, which will begin on Friday, "aims to help establish the risk posed to young players during matches and training sessions". One Premier League club will be involved in the study. The FA says it is committed to supporting research into degenerative brain disease among former players, but authorities in English football have been criticised over a perceived reluctance to confront the issue. Speaking in April, the FA's medical chief Dr Ian Beasley said the organisation wanted Fifa to investigate. He said it would be "taking some research questions to Fifa imminently" after it was revealed three members of England's 1966 World Cup squad - Martin Peters, Nobby Stiles and Ray Wilson - had Alzheimer's. Ian St John, who played for Liverpool between 1961-71, says six of his teammates - from a group of about 16 players - now have Alzheimer's. "I don't know why the FA and the PFA have covered this up for years," he said on the Victoria Derbyshire programme. "I talked about it to the PFA a couple of years ago, and their answer was: 'Well, women get dementia, so therefore it's not an industrial injury'. Which is a load of nonsense isn't it?" Former England and West Brom striker Jeff Astle, died aged 59 suffering from early onset dementia. The inquest into his death in 2002 found that repeatedly heading heavy leather footballs had contributed to trauma to his brain. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, his daughter Dawn Astle said: "At the coroner's inquest, football tried to sweep his death under a carpet. They didn't want to know, they didn't want to think that football could be a killer and sadly, it is. It can be." By the end he "didn't even know he'd ever been a footballer", she said, before adding: "Everything football ever gave him, football had taken away." Uefa's project follows similar initiatives in other sports. In September, American football's National Football League (NFL) announced it would spend $100m (£80m) on medical and engineering research to increase protection for players, after agreeing a $1bn (£800m) settlement to compensate ex-players who had suffered brain injuries. That figure was agreed in April following a lawsuit by 5,000 former players who successfully claimed the NFL hid the dangers of repeated head trauma. A UK RugbyHealth study is already examining the long-term health effects of playing rugby, including the effects of suffering frequent concussion. That followed a World Rugby research project, which published findings of a potential link between frequent concussion and brain damage in 2015. However, its lead researcher said it was "difficult" to draw robust conclusions, adding "further research was required". Researchers from University College London and Cardiff University examined the brains of five people who had been professional footballers and one who had been a committed amateur throughout his life. They had played football for an average of 26 years and all six went on to develop dementia in their 60s. While performing post mortem examinations, scientists found signs of brain injury - called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in four cases. CTE has been linked to memory loss, depression and dementia and has been seen in other contact sports. But the science is far from clear-cut. Each brain also showed signs of Alzheimer's disease and some had blood vessel changes that can also lead to dementia. Researchers speculate that it was a combination of factors that contributed to dementia in these players, but they acknowledge their research cannot definitively prove a link and are calling for larger studies. The Football Association welcomed the study and said research was particularly needed to find out whether degenerative brain disease is more common in ex-footballers. Dr Charlotte Cowie, of the FA, added: "The FA is determined to support this research and is also committed to ensuring that any research process is independent, robust and thorough, so that when the results emerge, everyone in the game can be confident in its findings." BBC sports news correspondent Richard Conway Many former players have been critical of a perceived reluctance by the FA and others to take action over a potential link between football and dementia. Proving a definitive link is difficult but new research shows there may be a causal connection between heading a ball and brain illnesses in later life. But is it just a matter for players of a previous generation, who used heavy leather footballs? Or does the problem persist in the modern age? Answers are needed. It is already too late for those suffering, potentially as a result of playing the game. It may, however, help many worried about whether they will be afflicted as they get older.	Uefa has commissioned a research project that will examine the links between dementia and playing football.
The 11 members of the cross-party Home Affairs Committee will use their findings to inform recommendations to the government. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said too often only the "loudest, angriest voices" were heard. She said immigration would be central to the Brexit deal. Immigration to the UK rose to a record level with 650,000 migrants in the year to June, Office for National Statistics figures released earlier this month showed. There was also a record number of EU citizens coming to live in Britain, 284,000. While net migration - immigration minus emigration - stayed near record levels, at 335,000. Launching the inquiry on Thursday, Ms Cooper told the committee: "There has been a lot of noise about immigration. "Too often all that gets heard are the loudest, angriest voices and others are silenced. "Some people exploit public concern to whip up fear and hatred. "But just because some people exploit the issue in a way that is totally wrong, [that] doesn't mean the rest of us should be silent from talking about it or ignore the problem. "It is not racist to worry about immigration. "We have to make sure we have a sensible debate." Earlier, Ms Cooper told the BBC's Breakfast programme: "People really need a say on what kind of reforms people want to immigration. "For too long successive governments have failed on immigration, and public concern has just gone up. "We should be having a really honest debate all round the country about what sorts of reforms, what kinds of controls people want to see." She said the government would be "crazy" not to listen to what people were saying about immigration. "If we don't get a consensus around the final Brexit deal, it will unravel," she added. The committee plans to hold public meetings, debates and online consultations. They are also encouraging community groups, business organisations, faith groups, think tanks and local councils to run their own debates.	A group of MPs are to hold public meetings across the UK to hear people's views on immigration and how it should be handled after the UK leaves the EU.
The Daycare Trust says nurseries in disadvantaged areas, where lower fees are charged, are more likely to raise childcare ratios. The charity also suggested increasing childcare ratios was risky. The government says the changes are not compulsory and it wants to improve the quality and affordability of childcare. It is due to make a further announcement on affordability soon. But it had argued that relaxing the staff to child ratios for certain age groups could enable nurseries to reduce their costs and therefore be more affordable, and has proposed allowing the ratio of staff to children aged two to three to be raised from one to four, to one to six. But the charity, which recently merged with the Family and Parenting Institute, says plans to alter ratios are likely to "exacerbate differences in quality that affect low income groups". This is because providers in most disadvantaged areas unlikely to be able to command the kind of high nursery fees that are charged in more affluent areas, it says. As a result, it argues, children from low income families are more likely to be cared for by providers who are looking after more children per member of staff. Chief executive Anand Shukla said: "The proposed changes to ratios will foster a two-tier quality system because parents can only choose the best childcare they can afford. "We know from our focus groups that parents want generous ratios. Parents on higher incomes will demand that providers stick with generous ratios, but parents on low incomes won't have that choice. "The result will be that children from low income families will be more likely to receive childcare from providers with the highest ratios and get less attention and support from staff." He added that there was a vicious circle where parents, particularly those on low incomes, found that working did not make financial sense because of the high cost of childcare. The charity's analysis of childcare costs suggests they are continuing to rise across the board. Next week it is set to give further details of how prices have risen across the board. The warning comes after the Pre-School Learning Alliance condemned the planned changes at a conference on childcare. Its chief executive Neil Leitch said: "Never in the past 12 years have I seen so much hostility towards a single initiative as this one. Why? Because we believe it entirely conflicts with the aim of putting the child first." He said a recent survey for his organisation had found that 94% of group day care providers thought the quality of their childcare would diminish if ratios were altered. "Yet, you would think that given around 70% of costs relate to staff wages, providers would be rushing out of their nursery doors jumping for joy at the prospect of increasing revenue - but it's the reverse." The Department for Education stressed that the more flexible ratios would only be possible where there were highly qualified staff. A spokesman said: "We are reforming the childcare system so that providers have more flexibility when they have highly qualified staff and childminders are better supported. "Ratio changes, which are not compulsory, will allow providers to have the flexibility to increase pay for better qualified workers. "High quality providers will be able to expand and more childminders will enter the market - this will mean parents have more affordable childcare. "Ofsted will be the only arbiter of quality, removing any council duplication. As a result more taxpayers' money will go to the frontline. "We want to help working families with costs and accessibility, and will make an announcement soon."	Plans in England to increase the child to nursery worker ratio could lead to a two-tier system, with a drop in quality in poor areas, a charity warns.
Tozer, 26, spent 2015-16 at Yeovil, who he joined from Northampton. The Plymouth-born player said: "It has been a bit of a whirlwind with the deal being sorted out so quickly, but I'm delighted to get the deal done and over the line." Newport manager Warren Feeney said: "He has experience at this level which will be a great benefit for us." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

He is the second Belgian cyclist to die in as many days after Antoine Demoitie was struck by a motorbike during Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem race. Myngheer, who turned professional last year, had been in an induced coma. His team, Roubaix Metropole Lille, said in a statement: "He lost his last race after fighting like a champion." Myngheer pulled up in difficulty 20 miles from the line in the first stage of the race at Porto-Vecchio on Saturday. He suffered the heart attack while in an ambulance, before being transferred by helicopter to hospital, where he was put on artificial respiration and fell into a coma. According to his team, Myngheer's organs have been donated. British cyclist Mark Cavendish tweeted: "Such a terribly sad few days in the professional cycling world. Another tragic loss. "RIP Daan Myngheer. My thoughts are with your loved ones." The Trek-Segafredo team added: "The cycling family loses another young talent. Our thoughts go to the loved ones and team members of Daan Myngheer." The latest tragedy comes after Demoitie, 25, was killed when he was hit by a motorbike on Monday. The accident happened after several riders crashed as they passed through northern France during Sunday's Gent-Wevelgem one-day race. Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died some time later. In January, six racers from the Giant-Alpecin team, including German John Degenkolb and Frenchman Warren Barguil, were injured in a collision with a car during a training ride south of Valencia.	Cyclist Daan Myngheer, 22, has died in hospital after suffering a heart attack during the first stage of the Criterium International in Corsica.
Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia won 16 of 22 cities with the anti-immigration Northern League and another party. The results were a setback for Matteo Renzi, the former centre-left prime minister seeking to return to power as head of the Democratic Party (PD). "It could have gone better," he admitted in a social media post. The PD currently heads a coalition led by Paolo Gentiloni, who took over after Mr Renzi lost a referendum on electoral reform in December 2016. The biggest defeats for the PD were in party strongholds such as Genoa, La Spezia and L'Aquila. The centre-right also won in other provincial capitals including Monza, Piacenza and Pistoia. Mr Berlusconi, 80, will now set his sights on the next general election, which is due in 2018 but may take place earlier. Silvio Berlusconi may hope that 80 is the new 40. The gains made by his Forza Italia party in local elections allow him to claim the start of yet another political comeback. "From these results the centre-right can set on a path to go back to ruling the country," he said in a statement. But there is a major road-block in the way of his return for a fourth time as prime minister: he is currently banned from holding political office. The ban, imposed following a 2013 conviction for tax fraud, doesn't expire until 2019. Unless he wins an early appeal at the European Court of Human Rights, Mr Berlusconi won't be able to run in Italy's 2018 general election. Mr Berlusconi founded Forza Italia in 1993 and became prime minister the following year, with the Northern League as part of his coalition government. Out of office in 1994, he then returned for a five-year period in 2001 and again in 2008 for three more years. His political career has been overshadowed by his legal battles, which culminated in a community service sentence for tax fraud. While Forza Italia's election advances were dramatic, commentators pointed to the low turnout of 46% and the first-past-the-post system in local elections. National polls are based on proportional representation. The ex-prime minister said he would now seek a moderate, liberal coalition drawn from Christian roots. However, one of the parties in his alliance is the far-right Brothers of Italy. Beppe Grillo's Five Star party fared poorly in the two-round vote, a year after it won control of Rome and Turin. Mr Grillo put a brave face on the result, pointing to victories in eight mayor races.	Italy's centre-right ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is celebrating local election success in an alliance with two right-wing parties.
Four of Mr Carmichael's constituents raised the case under the Representation of the People Act. They said the MP misled the electorate over a memo which claimed SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron to be re-elected prime minister. Roddy Dunlop QC asked judges at the Court of Session to dismiss the case. He told the specially-convened election court that the petition was "irrelevant" and "bound to fail". However, Jonathan Mitchell QC, representing the petitioners, later told the court that his clients believed that Mr Carmichael leaked the information to deliberately smear the SNP. The court heard that this was to reduce the chances of a Scottish National Party candidate being elected in Orkney and Shetland. The case, believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years, arose from remarks made by Mr Carmichael at the start of the general election campaign in April. The MP, who had been Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election, authorised leaking a civil service memo suggesting the first minister had told the French ambassador she backed Tory PM David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. Mr Carmichael had initially denied leaking the confidential memo to the Daily Telegraph. He claimed the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the "details of the account are not correct". Mr Carmichael was not in court for the hearing. His QC, Mr Dunlop, said Section 106 of the act forbids election candidates from making false and statements about their rival candidates. He stressed that a false statement of fact must be "directly related" to the personal character or conduct of a candidate. Ms Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP and Scotland's first minister, was not a candidate in May's general election. The QC said it would have been the "easiest thing in the world" for the Act to make it clear if a false statement could be about non-candidates. He also said attacking the political position of a candidate did not necessarily attack their character. Mr Dunlop said the case put by the petitioners "flies in the face of the authorities" and was "wrong in law". The QC said that if the petitioners were right then court would get a lot busier, as all that would be needed was a dispute during an election with one false answer. He said if this was the case then any prospective MP in the run-un to an election would have to be strapped to a lie detector and administered with a truth serum. Mr Mitchell representing the petitioners seeking to remove Mr Carmichael from office, said the MP did not dispute that he made certain statements of fact which were false, or that the statements were made before or during an election. However, Mr Mitchell said Mr Carmichael did dispute that he was attempting to affect the return of a candidate, as the petitioners claim he was. The hearing before Lady Paton and Lord Matthews continues on Tuesday. This is the first parliamentary election petition to be brought in Scotland since the Grieve V Douglas-Home case of 1965. That saw Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid - who was born Christopher Murray Grieve - attempting to unseat former prime minister Alec Douglas-Home who at the time was MP for Kinross and West Perthshire. MacDiarmid had claimed that the Conservative politician's election was void because he had participated in a national party election broadcast on behalf of the Conservative Party and had declared the costs of this on his election expenses. The court found that no offence had been committed, either by the candidate or the broadcaster.	A legal challenge over the election of Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael as Orkney and Shetland MP should be dismissed, his QC has claimed.
Media playback is not supported on this device Three years ago that person was Jonjoe, but after his mum persuaded him to go on a Snow-Camp ski course, everything changed. "I was worried because I felt he just didn't know where he was going," said Debby. "I never dreamed this would come out of that moment." I love the way Snow-Camp uses my sport to support young people who wouldn't ever get the chance to get involved in snow sports The thrill of taking part in snow sports often attracts young people but the associated costs can mean it is an experience only available to the privileged and wealthy. UK charity Snow-Camp works in deprived inner-city areas to use young people's interest in the sports to engage them and provide life skills, qualifications and vocational training. "I was a perfect candidate for it," says Jonjoe, who comes from Hackney Wick in London. "I'd never seen snow before, crazily! And never ever thought I'd put skis on." Jonjoe progressed through the charity's programmes and last year was offered a year's paid apprenticeship in the snow sports industry. "Through the apprenticeship I'm now an internationally-qualified ski coach and working my way up. Just through that one day of saying 'You know what mum, maybe I am going to go...', it's completely changed my life." You can watch more of Jonjoe's story on Ski Sunday on Sunday, 19 February, on BBC Two at 17.15 GMT (17.30 in Wales) - here we introduce two more Snow-Camp graduates and explain more about how the programme works... In 2014, Sami had dropped out of school and was often in trouble with the police. He lacked confidence and was facing a future that involved gangs, crime and continued unemployment. "I was easily influenced and vulnerable to bad decisions. I had an attitude and I wasn't the best with authority," he said. Snowboarding has already inspired me to improve my life and I want to use it to have a positive impact on others. "I didn't know what I wanted to do as I had been through so much and let it drag me to the lowest of the low." He turned to the youth club Ladbroke Grove for support who enrolled him on to Snow-Camp's programmes, and over the next year progressed to gain a Snowsport England Level 1 Snowboarding Instructor qualification. "I never knew I wanted to snowboard for the rest of my life," Sami added. "That's because I didn't want to because it's a sport that people like me don't even consider. "Snow-Camp has had a big effect on my personal life. I now feel like I can do something valuable and worthwhile with my time. "My dream is to become a full-time snowboard instructor. Snowboarding has already inspired me to improve my life and I want to use it to have a positive impact on others." Like many boys of his age, 13-year-old Hamza didn't enjoy school; he was often getting into trouble and had no aspirations for his future. His family were worried he may get involved with gangs and would struggle to gain any GCSEs so Hamza's youth worker got in touch with Snow-Camp. Hamza connected to snow sports immediately and was willing to work hard in classroom activities just to be able to strap on a snowboard. Hamza said: "Before Snow-Camp I didn't enjoy school... I did not think that I would enjoy snow sports or want to work hard in a classroom, but with Snow-Camp I do both of these things." Like Jonjoe and Sami, Hamza completed the programme of training which led to him being awarded one of the charity's apprenticeships. "I'm inspired to become a full-time snowboard and ski instructor, showing others the skills that can be learnt through these amazing sports," he said. "I want to show young people from estates like mine that they too can become snowboard and ski instructors." When Hamza finishes his apprenticeship in June 2017, his future is looking bright. At the end of Snow-Camp's 2015 programme year, 85% of young people who completed their Journey of Programmes went on to either employment, training or further education. To date, 90% of Snow-Camp apprentices gain a full-time job in the snow sports industry at the end of their apprenticeship. Snow-Camp works directly with youth projects and youth service providers to find participants who are most in need of support. The programmes are operated at indoor and artificial slopes in the UK: The charity runs a full range of programmes for young people aged 13-21, taking them from their first experience of snowboarding or skiing, through to instructor training for the over-16s and, for five students a year, a paid full-time apprenticeship. For every hour the trainees spend learning how to ski or snowboard, the same amount of time is spent in the classroom. "When you look inside Snow-Camp's programmes, they train an individual to be able to control certain aspects of behaviour, to channel negative energy into positive energy and create the overall outcome of someone who could work in the same industry as me," said Warren Smith, international free skier and ambassador for the charity. Sir Steve Redgrave is another supporter: "Snow-Camp is a fantastic charity helping those from deprived backgrounds do something positive. "People say snow sports are for the elite, and rowing has that reputation too. Snow-Camp proves this is not necessarily the case."	How can one skiing lesson change the life of a young person who is failing in school and getting into trouble?
If all over-30s followed recommended guidelines on exercise, nearly 3,000 lives could be saved each year in Australia alone, say researchers. More needs to be done to warn women of inactivity, as it outweighs other risk factors such as obesity, they say. Lack of exercise is a known major risk factor for heart disease, says the British Heart Foundation. A team at the University of Queensland, Australia tracked the health of more than 30,000 women born in the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s. They found smoking had the greatest impact on women's heart disease risk below the age of 30. However, as women got older and more gave up smoking, it was overtaken by physical inactivity as the dominant influence on heart disease risk. Continuing efforts to encourage people to stop smoking were warranted, the researchers reported in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. But they said greater effort were needed to promote exercise, which they describe as a "Cinderella" risk factor compared with obesity. "We need a lot more effort to keep middle-aged women active and then keep them active into old age," Prof Wendy Brown, of the university's centre for research on exercise, physical activity and health, told BBC News. "If you can do at least 30 minutes and preferably 45 minutes a day, you'll see huge improvements in your health and reduce your risk of heart disease by half." According to NHS Choices, adults aged 19-64 years are recommended to do 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, or 30 minutes on five days a week. Commenting on the study, Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said physical inactivity was a known major risk factor for heart disease. "Interestingly, this study shows its dominant influence on heart disease amongst women, and suggests a greater need to promote regular physical activity amongst this group," she said. "It's important to remember that heart disease is linked to other factors such as smoking, obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. "It's essential to manage these too, as the more risk factors you have, the greater your chance of heart disease. "	Lack of exercise is the biggest risk factor for heart disease in women aged 30 and above, according to a study.
President Cecile Richards told members of Congress on Tuesday she was "proud" that Planned Parenthood donates foetal tissue for research. The anti-abortion group behind the videos has alleged that the healthcare provider profits from the practice. The allegations have set off an effort to pull the group's federal funding. Ms Richards said foetal tissue donation is legal and noted its small role in what Planned Parenthood does. Planned Parenthood has said it charges small fees - between $30 (Â£20) and $100 - to cover processing costs, but does not make a profit from foetal donations. "These outrageous accusations based on videos are offensive and untrue," Ms Richards said. "But facts have never gotten in the way of campaigns to keep women from getting healthcare." Planned Parenthood is a non-profit group that provides reproductive health services to mostly lower-income Americans. Some of its locations perform abortions. Federal funds make up about 40% of its annual budget, but federal law prohibits the funding of abortions except in rare cases. Conservative Republicans in Congress have threatened to shut down the government in hopes of ending federal support for Planned Parenthood. However, Republican congressional leaders have opposed a shutdown and President Obama has vowed to veto any attempt to defund Planned Parenthood. During a hearing on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers scrutinised the organisation's finances and chided Ms Richards for her salary, travel budgets and the organisation's rate of health screenings. Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat, said he was in full support of keeping the organisation funded. "For many poor women, Planned Parenthood may be one of their only services of medical care in underserved or rural communities," he said. "Big question for my Republican colleagues: Do you really want to do this? Align yourself with radical extremists who manipulate the facts?" Some lawmakers told Ms Richards that Planned Parenthood's funding should be re-directed toward other US health clinics that would supposedly provide more services. "The taxpayers... have a right to know how this money is being spent," said Representative Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming. "They have a right to know if if taxpayer dollars are being used to free up services you provide that are abhorrent services in the view of many taxpayers when there are alternatives in this country." Republicans argued during the hearing that those other health centres across the US would be able to handle the influx of patients should Planned Parenthood lose its funding. Representative Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, said he disagreed and that unintended pregnancy and abortion rates would actually go up if Planned Parenthood ceased to exist. Citing a Congressional Budget Office study, he said that 390,000 women in the US would lose access to health care without Planned Parenthood. Both anti-abortion activists and Planned Parenthood supporters could be seen on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with many wearing pink T-shirts to show their support for Ms Richards' organisation.	The head of Planned Parenthood has defended her organisation before Congress, calling a series of secretly recorded videos a "smear campaign".
The rapper and songwriter said she would never condone Nazism in her art. She added that both the producer and the person in charge of the video "happen to be Jewish". The video also features rapper Drake, who is half Jewish. Minaj said the video had not been influenced by Adolf Hitler's party but by a cartoon called Metalocalypse and also by Sin City, the comic book that was made into a film. The director Jeff Osborne has been retweeting both positive and negative reviews of the video. Her apology came after Anti-Defamation League, one of the top civil rights agency in the US said the video used "Third Reich imagery". They argued the video was "a trivialization of the history of that era". In the video Nicki Minaj is portrayed wearing a black body suit with stylised black letters on her chest. Some fans said this resembled a swastika. Long red banners bearing the logo hang above her as she sits at the end of a corridor of tanks. Guns fade across the screen as a drawing of Chris Brown in an authoritarian uniform flashes up, the logo emblazoned on his cap. Troops in futuristic outfits are also drawn into the video, as well as grim reapers, futuristic flashing gas masks and storm trooper-type characters who appear to fan Minaj.  The ADL welcomed her apology, adding "We hope that she will take further steps to educate herself and her fans about who the Nazis were and why we should never take genocide or the Holocaust lightly." Her full Twitter comments can be seen below.	Nicki Minaj has apologised after the lyric video for her 'Only' track was accused of containing Nazi imagery.
The Dutch-owned firm suspended deliveries last month after losing funding. It had been delivering about 3m letters every week in the three cities, in direct competition with Royal Mail. The private equity arm of Lloyds bank decided not to invest, triggering a review. Parent group PostNL said the firm had begun a consultation with affected staff "to minimise the impact of the decision". The company also pointed out it would continue to collect 80m items a week to be fed into the Royal Mail system for final delivery. A statement released by PostNL said: "Following the termination of the discussions on the proposed investment in Whistl UK to fund the further rollout of its current end-to-end (E2E) activities, we have assessed alternative scenarios for Whistl's E2E operations. "Further to this assessment, it has been decided to end Whistl's E2E operations. "Whistl remains committed to further developing its successful activities in the UK, including downstream access (DSA) service, door-drop media, packets and parcels and logistics." About 1,800 workers were employed by Whistl, with many on zero-hours contracts. Whistl is the second largest postal operator in the UK.	Postal business Whistl has confirmed it is ending its home delivery service in London, Liverpool and Manchester, putting up to 1,800 jobs at risk.
13 October 2016 Last updated at 00:23 BST Many analysts think Sony's kit will outsell rival headsets from HTC and Facebook's Oculus division because of its lower price and the fact that more than 43 million PS4 consoles have been shipped. Even so, they add, it is likely to remain a niche product for some time to come. Strategy Analytics forecasts that only 3% of Brits will own a VR headset this year and the PlayStation model will account for just 7% of that number. The bulk, it says, will instead own more basic "shells" into which they can slot a smartphone. BBC Click's Marc Cieslak put the PS VR to the test and had reservations of his own. More at BBC.com/Click and @BBCClick.	The PlayStation's virtual reality headset is making its way into gamers' homes - the last of this year's three big VR hardware releases.
The News Letter's lead focuses on what they are calling a "huge cash request at Stormont talks". The paper has seen a leaked document detailing a proposal submitted to the political talks process aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland executive. The suggestion from the chief executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency, Ian Crozier, to the head of languages at the Department of Communities, proposes an additional Â£140m in funding for Ulster-Scots culture. Mr Crozier is a former special adviser to DUP MP Nigel Dodds and remains a member  of the party, according to the News Letter. His paper outlined his belief that "the Ulster-Scots community is facing discrimination" and that the Irish language receives 10 times more funding than all Ulster-Scots culture combined. Staying with politics, the News Letter reports that the DUP South Antrim MP Sammy Wilson is "fed up" with MLAs "gurning", which is, incidentally, Ulster-Scots for complaining. His remarks come as a complaint against his DUP colleague Edwin Poots for allegedly breaching the Northern Ireland assembly's code of conduct was dismissed. "Why can they not just be grown up and accept that, look, in the rough-and-tumble of politics, people will say things you don't like, and you just have to live with it, rather than running to granda or daddy to reprimand people you don't like," Mr Wilson said. "Hero policeman dies in Thailand," is the front page headline in the Belfast Telegraph, the story billed as exclusive. 50-year-old Heath Taylor died in what the paper describe as a "freak accident". Mr Taylor was a friend of PSNI chief constable George Hamilton, the Telegraph reports. Devoting two pages of coverage to Mr Taylor's death, the paper reveals that Mr Taylor received a citation while a serving officer in the RUC. The Telegraph also gives two pages to political coverage as issues around Brexit and the crisis in Northern Ireland's political system begin to re-emerge after the summer break. The Irish News leads with a question for health authorities: "Why did ambulance take 10 hours to reach Jimmy (79), leaving him to die alone?" Jimmy Cassidy was found dead in his home at Brookvale Fold in north Belfast on Sunday, the paper reports. A friend, Michael O'Reilly, found him collapsed at about 19:00 BST on Saturday and called an ambulance, which, he said, did not arrive until 05:00 BST on Sunday. The ambulance service told the Irish News that it could not comment on the issue as an internal investigation in the circumstances  is under way. The paper's editorial is a call to "root out sectarianism" following recent events in Londonderry, a city which has been, according to the Irish News, "a strongly positive example" for other area in recent years.	There is an eclectic mix of stories on the front pages of Northern Ireland's daily papers this morning.
David McLean, 30, and Ryan Gilmour, 24, deny the charge, allegedly committed at Banner Drive in Glasgow on 23 October last year. They have lodged court papers blaming another man for the crime. The men are accused of reversing a Nissan Quashqai at PCs Deborah Lawson and Robert Fitzsimmons and repeatedly striking them. The charge further states that the police officers were trapped behind the open driver's door and dragged backwards and knocked to the ground. It is claimed that Mr McLean and Mr Gilmour then drove forwards at PC Lawson, who was lying injured in the road, causing her colleague PC Fitzsimmons to seize her and drag her out of the path of the car to avoid further injury. The men also deny later setting fire to the Quashqai at Lennox Gardens in the Scotstoun area of the city and attempting to defeat the course of justice by doing so. It is also alleged that the car had false plates and had been reset by means of theft. Mr Gilmour is also accused of driving while disqualified and having no insurance. Both men are also alleged to have committed a breach of the peace in Banner Drive by brandishing bottles, shouting and swearing, attempting to force entry to a flat and pouring liquid through a letter box. Mr McLean and Mr Gilmour deny all the charges against them and trial was set for June at the High Court in Edinburgh. Both men have lodged special defences of incrimination. The trial is expected to last for eight days.	Two men are to face trial accused of attempting to murder two police officers by driving a car at them.
The result saw the Cumbrians slip to 10th in the table, but they remain just one point outside the play-off places with two games remaining. Carlisle, 2-0 down after 25 minutes, were level before the interval and led through Reggie Lamb before Smith had the final say. Carlisle midfielder Jamie Davitt fired against the post and Jamie Proctor put a good chance wide before Crawley took the lead in the 11th minute. Leading marksman James Collins opened the scoring in superb style by smashing a tremendous shot into the top corner from 20 yards. Collins was on target again after 25 minutes from the penalty spot, sending Mark Gillespie the wrong way after the goalkeeper had brought down the striker. Striker Jabo Ibehre, put clean through by Danny Grainger, reduced the deficit four minutes later with his fourth goal in four games. Crawley keeper Glenn Morris was then hurt as Ibehre put the ball in the net and had to be replaced by Yusuf Mersin. Carlisle were level three minutes before the break when Proctor, on loan from Bolton, struck with a bullet header following a Gary Liddle cross. United seized the lead on the hour through Lambe, who clipped the ball past replacement keeper Mersin after latching onto Proctor's cross. Josh Payne fired just wide late on for Crawley and Collins also headed over before the hosts levelled in the second minute of stoppage time when Smith fired in following a pass from Joe McNerney.
