The 59-year-old was killed in a crash on the Old Military Road near to Castle Douglas on Wednesday. Emergency services were sent to the location at about 23:30 but the man - who was riding a black Triumph bike - had died at the scene. The road was closed for about five hours to allow for collision investigations to take place. PC Hazel Smyth said: "We are carrying out a full crash investigation into this collision and would ask that anyone who may have witnessed this RTC get in touch with us. "We are particularly keen to speak with anyone who may have travelled the Old Military Road between 16:30 and 23:30 on Wednesday."	A motorcyclist has died in an accident on a minor road in Dumfries and Galloway.
Abdul Hafidah was stabbed after he was hit by a car at about 17:15 BST on Thursday. He died later in hospital from a stab wound to the neck. Police believe he had been chased by a group of men near Greenheys Lane before being hit by the blue Vauxhall Corsa on Moss Lane East and then stabbed. A 19-year-old man is being questioned, Greater Manchester Police said. Two other people have been arrested in connection with Mr Hafidah's death. A 19-year-old man from Moss Side , who was arrested on suspicion of murder on Sunday after handing himself in at Longsight police station, remains in custody for questioning. A 17-year-old boy earlier arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has been bailed pending further inquiries. Officers are appealing for anyone with dash-cam or mobile phone footage of the incident to pass it on to them via dropbox or by calling at their local police station.	A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an 18-year-old man in the Moss Side area of Manchester.
Labour asked for the data to be released to Parliament. The government blamed "unacceptably lax" contracts that allow staff to re-join the NHS a month after redundancy. It says it's working on tough new plans to cap payouts, and has reduced administrative posts overall. Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said it would be galling for nurses who were battling over pay to see, as he put it, cheques handed out like confetti. Auditors have previously reported that the average payout was £43,000. The number of national health service staff estimated to have been made redundant and later re-employed almost doubled in the last year - from 2,200 managers - Ministerial responses to Parliamentary Questions have revealed. The total now stands at 3,950. Overall, more than 10,000 full-time workers were made redundant from the NHS in England since the restructuring of the service. Changes introduced in April 2013 have seen 150 primary care trusts, run by managers, replaced with 211 clinical commissioning groups, led by family doctors. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: "By reducing managers and administrators by over 21,100, we are freeing up extra resources for patient care - £5.5 billion in this Parliament and £1.5 billion every year thereafter."	New figures indicate that almost 4,000 staff made redundant from the NHS in England, before last year's major restructuring, have since been re-employed.
President Uhuru Kenyatta and Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn agreed the deal in the border town of Moyale. The deal aims to tackle youth unemployment by creating jobs in the energy, mining and livestock industries. Tensions between rival ethnic groups have risen due to lack of land and water. There was a heavy security presence ahead of the meeting on the Kenya-Ethiopia border. "This is a historic function," Kenya's President Kenyatta was quoted as saying. He said a tarmac road would be built by September 2016, linking the two countries' capital cities. Cross-border raids have forced thousands to flee their homes in recent years.	Kenya and Ethiopia have signed a UN-backed trade deal worth $200m (Â£130m) in a bid to ease cross-border conflict.
The review panel says WHO was too slow to act to get on top of the deadly virus which has now killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa. And it calls for an urgent overhaul of the organisation. WHO says it has plans for reform. It has already admitted that it waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern. WHO Director General, Margaret Chan, admitted in May it had been "overwhelmed" by the Ebola outbreak, saying it "shook this organization to its core". The disease began spreading in December 2013, but it took until August 2014 for WHO to sound the alarm. By that point, more than 1,000 people had died of the virus. The death toll now stands at more than 11,000. According to the report, WHO lacked a culture of rapid decision-making. In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent about the seriousness of the situation but these "either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance". "There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action," the report says. WHO was also criticised for failing to keep governments and the public up to speed about the extent and severity of the outbreak. But the review praised WHO for playing a critical role in pushing forward work to find new treatments and cures for Ebola. And it said WHO should be given the job of leading future health emergency responses - be that for Ebola or an outbreak of pandemic flu, for example. The report suggests an immediate contribution from all member countries towards a $100 million special outbreak response fund, and says WHO should establish a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The panel's head, Dame Barbara Stocking, former chief executive of the charity Oxfam, said the WHO must now be made fit for the task. "To me, coming from somewhere like Oxfam which is an emergency culture, you are very much, if you like, on the front foot. You are always trying to prevent a situation coming through or grab it when it starts and really get it under control very fast and those are some of the internal changes that have to be made at WHO." The WHO said it was "already moving forward" on some of the panel's recommendations including the development of the global health emergency workforce and the contingency fund. It will be up to member states to make these voluntary financial contributions. Dr Joanne Liu, President of MSF International, questioned how the recommendations would translate to real action on the ground. "We have seen so many reports calling for change, with everyone focused on how to improve future response and meanwhile, with 20-25 new Ebola cases per week in the region, we still don`t have the current epidemic under control. On Ebola, we went from global indifference, to global fear, to global response and now to global fatigue. We must finish the job," she said. Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said the support of the global community was crucial if we are to avert another catastrophe on the scale of Ebola."	The Ebola crisis proves the World Health Organization (WHO) lacks the "capacity and culture" to deal with global health emergencies, says a damning independent report, commissioned by the WHO itself.
RSPB Scotland is planning improvements for people and wildlife at the site on the south-eastern edge of Alloa. The wetland and grassland is a popular site for birds including snipe, short-eared owls, teals and black-headed gulls. New paths, viewing areas and signage are to be installed over the coming months with a series of events planned. The wetlands near the banks of the Forth and the Black Devon river were created when soil was dug out to cap a nearby landfill area. Managed lagoons were formed by Clackmannanshire Heritage Trust, and later expanded in the mid 2000s by the council's landfill project. RSPB Scotland's regional director for south and west Scotland, Anne McCall, said: "We're delighted to be taking on the management of the Black Devon Wetlands and we hope to transform it into a reserve that will not only help wildlife, but also provide local people with a great nature experience right on their doorstep. "The Inner Forth is internationally recognised as an important place for birds, and the establishment of this reserve adds to a wider mosaic of habitats that are beneficial for a whole range of different species, as part of the RSPB's landscape-scale project, the Inner Forth Futurescape."	Scotland's newest nature reserve is to be set up at the Black Devon Wetlands in Clackmannanshire.

The Mourne County were 4-1 outsiders for their semi-final against Monaghan but clinched a 1-14 to 0-15 victory. "I'm confident if we go there and express ourselves and play hard, we have a realistic chance of becoming Ulster champions," says Burns. "But we know that it's going to be a huge task." 1991 and 1994 All-Ireland medallist Burns endured a torrid start to his Down managerial stint as his side lost 11 straight competitive games before a remarkable escape act earlier this year saw them avoid a second successive league relegation as they remained in Division Two. "When I took over the job, I knew there were going to be tough times ahead. I had prepared for that but at times there was quite a bit of undue criticism of the team," adds the Down boss. "Whenever I took the job, I lost maybe eight or 10 players and they were the most experienced players in the panel. "So you are starting from scratch as such. You are having to start and build a panel and you are bringing in young and inexperienced players who might have played at minor and under-21 level. "There is a massive step up from under-21 to having to play at senior level. But we worked away, we kept our heads down, we introduced quite a few players and the ball is starting to roll in the right direction for us." Burns believes the concluding league draw in Cork which kept Down in Division Two as Derry and Fermanagh suffered the drop was a key moment in his team's development. "We knew we were going to have to get something when we were down there and it had been a long time since Down had got anything in Cork. "We had a tough second half with them but we battled it out and the result kept us in Division Two and gave us a platform to build on in the lead-in to the championship." Despite avoiding the drop to join Armagh in Division Three, Down still went into the Ulster derby against the Orchard County on 4 June as underdogs but the Mournemen produced a composed second-half display to earn a deserved 0-15 to 2-7 victory. "We knew if we performed on the day that we had a massive chance of beating Armagh. That result gave us a great boost and then we had another great win against Monaghan." Burns' matter of fact description of belies the emotion he showed at the final whistle of the provincial semi-final in the Athletic Grounds as he emotionally embraced the Down county secretary Sean Og McAteer. "I think there are a couple of of pictures of me hugging him. It was just great to give the players an opportunity to play in an Ulster Final. The players had taken the brunt of the criticism when we struggled after I took on the job." As for Sunday's final, Burns knows full well that his side be even bigger underdogs than in their two most recent games. "Tyrone are laden with a lot of experience and a lot of talent. They play in Division One and had a good league campaign this year. "They have played in Croke Park for the last four or five years so yes it's going to be very difficult for us. "But we have a lot of self-belief and inner strength which we are going to have to dig into and use to battle hard if we are going to get a result."	Down manager Eamonn Burns believes his side are capable of causing another shock by beating holders Tyrone in Sunday's Ulster Football Final.
Cheng says a lot of people who aren't funny are afraid to be "weird" or "deviate from what's normal". This is a mistake, he says, arguing that comedians shouldn't be worried about having controversial views. "I think a lot of funniness comes from ideas which may be different, and that's why a lot of comedians come from a different background and have a different point of view," he says. "Embrace that." Cheng himself dropped out of his maths degree at Cambridge University in 2008 to become a professional poker player before later getting into comedy. He brings an analytical approach to his comedy, using graphs and a PowerPoint presentation in his Edinburgh performance. Read about the joke that won him the award, here. With the growth of online streaming sites like Netflix, there is a lot of comedy available. Cheng says those wanting to be funnier should be watching plenty of it - particularly the things they find most funny. Doing this helps develop a sense of humour and potentially a distinct comedic voice, Cheng says. "Start off imitating it and you will find your own voice, because a lot of comedy comes by imitating enough things, which can create a different voice." Making friends laugh doesn't only make you and them feel good - it can be a stepping stone to making others laugh, Cheng argues. "If you make your friends laugh I think it's one of the greatest ways to connect with people. It's a stepping stone to making others laugh." While Cheng didn't do it himself, he knows other comedians and friends who have taken stand-up and improvisational comedy courses. These courses can give people an understanding of joke writing and experience of performing in a supportive environment. Cheng developed his own comedy skills in the familiar environment of students gigs in Cambridge, where he continued to live after dropping out of his degree in 2008. Cheng says social media can be a good place to try out jokes without the pressure of getting on stage. "It's a good way, because you don't have to go in front of people and you can realise 'I know how to do this.'" But above all else, Cheng has some words of encouragement for people who hope to be funny. "If you have a sense of humour then you probably have the potential to be funny," he adds. "Being a Chinese comedian is much easier than being a female comedian because no one ever comes up to you after a gig and says 'you were pretty funny... for a Chinese comedian'." "I walked in on my flatmate looking at an optical illusion with his pants down. He jumped up and screamed 'it's not what it looks like!'" Ken Cheng is performing at The Cellar, Pleasance Courtyard, at the Fringe Festival, each day at 16:45 BST until 27 August.	The winner of the best joke award at this year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Ken Cheng, shares five tips on how to be funnier, be it on stage or just in front of a group of friends.
Ricky Burlton, 20, from Enfield, London, died after he was hit by a car on the A10 exit slip road at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. Officers want to question Alexi Shyti, who is thought to have been living under an assumed named at the time. Mr Shyti, believed to have been driving a Rover involved in the crash, fled the country the next day. Albania national Mr Shyti sustained serious facial injuries in the crash on 4 June 2010, and was at Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield when police found him. It is believed Mr Shyti - who told police he was Greek man Georgios Tsoulos - was living in the UK illegally with a fake EU passport. Det Insp Pushpa Guild urged anyone with information on Mr Shyti's whereabouts to contact police. "We know Aleksi Shyti had been in Albania and would also ask anyone with connections there and who knows where he may be to call us. "We believe he may have now travelled to Greece and he also has connections to Italy. "In the UK, he had connections in Hertfordshire, North London and Loughborough in Leicestershire." Ricky's mother Dawn said: "Five years is an extremely long time not knowing what truly happened to our precious son and brother. "However, the one thing Ricky's mother, brothers and sister have is our unity as Ricky's family to continue with our search to find Aleksi Shyti."	A fresh appeal has been made in a bid to find a man wanted in connection with a fatal crash five years ago.
Kyle Sheehan was stabbed in the leg in Jiggins Lane, Bartley Green, at about 22:15 BST on 21 September. A man, 23, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Three people, aged 16, 18 and 29, arrested on suspicion of wounding have been released on bail. Kyle had been in intensive care but died on Friday night, West Midlands Police said. Det Ch Insp Wayne Jones: "He leaves behind a family and many friends who are distraught and struggling to come to terms with what has happened. "We know many people were in the area and would have seen what went on that night but many are still yet to come forward. "We appeal to you to speak to us and help us find those people responsible for killing Kyle."	A 16-year-old boy who was stabbed in Birmingham has died, prompting a murder investigation.
The picture sees 163 of this year's nominees gathered together and smiling away, but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on. Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this year's photo. 1. Pharrell Williams didn't exactly dress for the occasion All of this year's male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits. Well, almost all. The "dress code" memo must have gone into Pharrell's junk email inbox, because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater. To be fair - the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it, a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures. Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film, which tells the story of three African-American women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s. 2. Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Affleck's facial hair Casey Affleck's facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world. It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season. It's now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams, Affleck's co-star in Manchester by the Sea, who has to peep out from behind his mane. She must be used to Affleck stealing her limelight. The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137-minute movie, while Williams's screen time clocks in at 11 minutes. 3. The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile. He's the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue - which went on to become Moonlight, one of this year's most hotly-tipped Oscars contenders. McCraney is so pleased with the film's success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received, and he is seen here holding up eight fingers. (There is, of course, another explanation. He could be making the "305" hand gesture - which is the area code for Miami-Dade county, his home and the place where Moonlight is set.) Also - hats off to Shawn Levy (who's standing next to Tarell), who wins the award for the most delightfully bright smile of the whole photo. He is the producer of Arrival, which is nominated for best picture. 4. Justin Timberlake needs to sack his tailor "What's your inside leg measurement, Justin?" "I don't know, maybe 32 inches?" "Hmmm, I don't have enough material for that. Have a 28-inch pair of trousers instead." "Great, that'll do, thanks Derek." 5. The front row is so where we wanna be Emma Stone, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, Octavia Spencer are all sitting together in the front row. Can someone please organise for us to join this BFF group, that'd be great, thanks. Extra respect for Octavia Spencer for wearing a pair of white trousers while so many of the other female nominees are in a dress or skirt, and for Natalie Portman, who manages to create the illusion she's impressively wearing high heels even while pregnant with twins. (She is actually wearing her flat shoes and tipping her heels up. Crafty.) Also - Manchester by the Sea producer Kimberly Steward (far right) is that sweet kid in your class who was accidentally never looking at the camera in the school photo every single year. 6. Ryan Gosling needs to cheer up You're the lead actor in the jointly most-nominated film of all time, pal. Uncross your arms for goodness sake. Slightly happier to be there is the lovely Dev Patel, in the row in front, looking every inch the Hollywood star. He's come a long way from how he looked at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 when he was starring in Slumdog Millionaire. He told the BBC: "I first came to Toronto in my school shoes and I had a blazer and I was with Frida [Pinto, his co-star] and they said 'You can't put this guy next to her because he looks so terrible'. I think I got a free penguin suit that didn't quite fit me and they gave me shoes." This year, he's nominated for best supporting actor and is seen wearing a burgundy Valentino suit. Nice. 7. Is this gap for Meryl Streep? Missing nominees from the photo include Michael Shannon (nominated for best supporting actor for Nocturnal Animals) and Andrew Garfield (best actor, Hacksaw Ridge). But of course, the most notable absentee is Her Royal Acting Highness, Meryl Streep - who is up for best actress this year for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins. Maybe this gap in the back row behind Denzel Washington was intended for her, and she got held up in traffic. Alternatively, perhaps she's been to so many of these things she's just had enough. Either way, we're pretty sure she'll be at the ceremony. This year's Oscars, which will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will take place in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 26 February.

This year's Oscars "class photo" has been released - and as usual there are several quirks and questionable outfits.
Bosworth Water Park, in Leicestershire, was closed after police were called at about 15:50 BST on Saturday. The boy was taken to hospital but later died. A man and woman have been arrested and remain in custody, Leicestershire Police said. One woman, who was at the park with her daughter, said she had not been there long when she saw CPR being done on a little boy by the side of the water. Samantha Scott said: "I'm not sure myself how the incident happened, there were a lot of children in the water yesterday, most with adults. "The water was so murky with all the sand, if anyone had gone under, you wouldn't have been able to see them at all. "I wouldn't let either of mine go in further than their knees as the water had stones underneath it too and both girls cut their feet. It looked very deep in the middle. "The first we saw was a gentleman performing CPR, everyone had gone quiet and you could tell we were all listening for a cry or any sign everything was OK. "The air ambulance arrived but we left just as they flew off." Another eyewitness, Olivia Quinn, said the scene was "horrific". "It hasn't left my mind seeing the boy's body on the ground and seeing people try to save him by giving him CPR," said Miss Quinn. "Everyone was in shock, crying and praying for the little boy. The ambulance took a while to come as it was so busy with people everywhere and cars all around the park. "It wasn't looking good as it must have been 30 minutes a man was still trying with CPR. "When I saw the boy's body being moved on the stretcher into the ambulance, I could see paramedics still giving CPR in the ambulance. A few cars followed the ambulance and I was thinking to myself that must be the parents." Owner Nigel Riley said it was a "dreadful incident" and the park in Market Bosworth reopened on Sunday. A statement on its Facebook page said: "From all of the staff at Bosworth Water Park we would like to pass on our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by this tragic loss of life." Police have asked people "not to speculate" about the circumstances of the death. Any witnesses who may have seen what happened should contact the force, especially if they have any video footage from Saturday of the Blue Lagoon beach area.	A five-year-old boy has died in a suspected drowning at a water park.
Council officers have advised against a self-rising barrier due to technical challenges and environment constraints. The walkway with glass panels would cost about Â£15m to install. A Dumfries and Galloway Council report said a significant amount of work had been done to address public concerns over visual impact and loss of parking. It is the latest attempt to find a compromise solution to tackle flooding from the River Nith in the town. Analysis: Giancarlo Rinaldi, BBC news website south Scotland reporter The time has come, surely, for the words to end and action to start. It will probably never be possible to come up with a solution to the Whitesands flooding which pleases everybody but most people agree something should be done. Anyone who has lived in Dumfries for any length of time knows it is a chronic problem which dates back for decades. The issues must have been aired well enough by now to allow the construction phase of some kind of scheme to begin. Otherwise, we will just have to accept - like previous generations - that it is something Dumfries must learn to live with. More than 5,500 people signed a petition against plans to build an embankment along the waterfront. Now a 1.3m (4ft 3in) raised walkway is being suggested with a 1.2m (4ft) glass wall on top. It comes after the latest round of public engagement events which found 83% of people in favour of some kind of flood protection scheme in the area. However, the questionnaire used to gauge opinion did not ask people outright which of the two remaining options they would prefer. That has led to accusations from some respondents that the survey was designed to give the council the result it wanted. Environment, economy and infrastructure committee chairman, councillor Colin Smyth, said: "After a consultation process that has stretched on for three years, it is now time for councillors to take a decision and make clear the way forward. "We know that options such as dredging and flooding upstream have been thoroughly investigated and, unfortunately, simply do not provide a solution. "However, councillors will have the opportunity to consider options that not only will tackle flooding but also regenerate the Whitesands." He also stressed that "as a direct result of the extensive public consultation" their proposals had "changed significantly". What do you think? Is it time for the talking to stop and some kind of flood protection project be put in place on the Whitesands in Dumfries or should the scheme be scrapped completely? Email your thoughts todumfries@bbc.co.uk.	A raised walkway has been recommended as the "optimal solution" to long-standing flooding problems in the Whitesands area of Dumfries.
Rajinder Sidhu, of Crathie Avenue, Dumfries, was on a petition before Sheriff Brian Mahon in private. The appearance follows an alleged attack at the Tesco car park in Dumfries earlier this month. A spokesperson for the procurator fiscal said that no plea or declaration was made and Mr Sidhu was committed for further examination. He was remanded in custody.	A 30-year-old man has made a brief appearance in court at Dumfries on a charge of rape.
Former England under-17 player Clark joined the U's on loan in March last season, making nine league appearances for Shaun Derry's side. The 20-year-old has yet to play a game for Hull's senior team.

The spacecraft is aiming to make a dump-down on the planet’s Meridiani Plain a week on Wednesday. US researchers have suggested sand particles could soon start lifting into the atmosphere - something they do on a regular, seasonal basis. But the European Space Agency says it is unconcerned. Indeed, some scientists are even excited at the prospect. “We always knew we could arrive in a dust storm and Schiaparelli was designed with that possibility in mind,” said Esa project scientist, Jorge Vago. “And from the point of view of getting data on the electrification of dusty atmospheres, it could be very nice,” he told BBC News. Schiaparelli is carrying to Mars the first ever instrument dedicated to this purpose. The US space agency put out a release last week that raised the idea of an imminent storm, noting it could eventually evolve into the type that envelops the whole globe. In truth, it is unlikely to get that big for many weeks - if at all. But, irrespective of timescales, European engineers insist they are prepared. A lot of dust in the Martian air would increase abrasion on Schiaparelli’s entry heatshield and on the big parachute it will use to slow the fall to Meridiani. All this has been tested in advance on Earth. Likewise with any associated strong winds - the plain is wide enough and flat enough to accommodate an off-centre landing. “The only thing it could affect is the images we take on descent,” explained flight director Michel Denis. “If it’s too dusty we might not be able to see the surface so well.” Schiaparelli is a 600kg demonstrator - a trial of procedures and technologies needed to land on the Red Planet. Europe’s only previous attempt to land on Mars was short-lived. Its 2003 Beagle-2 effort failed to deploy properly after touching down, subsequent satellite pictures revealed. Schiaparelli will hope to fare better, albeit with a planned surface operation of only a few days. The probe is part of Esa’s ExoMars programme to explore the Red Planet and search for signs of past or present life. The other parts of the project include Schiaparelli’s “mothership”, called the Trace Gas Orbiter. Once this satellite has dropped off the Italian-built entry module, it will remotely investigate Mars’ atmosphere and geology. The final part of ExoMars is a UK-assembled robot rover, to be delivered to the planet’s surface in 2021. Key elements of Schiaparelli will be replicated in the platform that places the six-wheeled vehicle on the ground. This includes all the algorithms for guidance, navigation and control (GNC), as well as the doppler radar which determines the distance to the ground. "With the GNC and the radar, we will be carrying over the ‘brains’ of the Schiaparelli, if you like,” explained Vincenzo Georgio from aerospace prime contractor Thales Alenia Space. Schiaparelli and Beagle-2 have little in common. For one thing they use very different technology to make the final approach. Beagle relied on bouncing airbags to cushion its moment of impact; Schiaparelli will use retro-rockets to bring it to a hover above the surface before then belly-flopping from two metres. A crushable underside will soften the dump-down. One instrument has been carried over, however. A wind sensor that was on Beagle is flying again in Schiaparelli’s package of environmental instruments. “I’ve been waiting 13 years for this data,” said Colin Wilson from Oxford University. The British scientist is another of those researchers who would be quite keen to see conditions start to whip up ahead of landing. “For me the most exciting thing would be being on the edge of a dust storm when the front comes over. That's when you'd get the biggest wind gradients and biggest turbulence,” he told BBC News. The Trace Gas Orbiter will eject Schiaparelli this Sunday on a direct path to encounter Mars on the Wednesday. Assuming its heatshield, parachute and rockets do their job, the probe should land on Meridiani Plain at 14:48 GMT (15:48 BST; 16:48 CEST). The current distance between Earth and Mars (167 million km; 104 million miles) means there is a light-travel time for any radio signal of over nine minutes. So, Esa will know they have a successful landing if they are continuing to receive a UHF transmission from the probe at the top of the hour. That UHF transmission - simple tones, but no telemetry - will be picked up by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune, in India, and relayed to the European Space Operations Centre (mission control) in Darmstadt, Germany. A fuller telemetry report from Schiaparelli will wait on a pass overhead from Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter some hours later. A successful landing will give a much-needed boost to the ExoMars programme which has struggled for many years with its schedule and budget. Project managers would like to go into a key meeting of Esa member states in November to report not only that Schiaparelli performed as designed but that the latest revisions to the rover plans will also deliver a solid mission. "It's the last big council meeting before the ministerial in December and we want to come out of that meeting with flying colours," said Dr Vago.

The 40-year-old, capped 42 times by Finland, joined the Latics at the beginning of 2015-16 and has gone to play 32 games and keep 15 clean sheets. Wigan are currently second in the table and on an 18-match unbeaten run. "If my experience can help what we want to achieve then that is fantastic," said the veteran keeper. "I've really enjoyed my season here so far, the team is playing well, the club have been very good to me and it's been great to play for the manager [Gary Caldwell] with the way he does things." Latics manager Gary Caldwell added: "Jussi has been absolutely tremendous since breaking into the team. "I've said on several occasions when asked about him that there's nothing I can teach him about goalkeeping, or how to recover and train."	Wigan Athletic goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen has signed an extended deal at the League One club that will expire in the summer of 2017.
Philip Blackwood was jailed last March for using an image of Buddha to promote his bar. Those being released include 52 people jailed for political offences. It comes just over a week before the new parliament meets for the first time since last year's election victory by the opposition pro-democracy NLD party. Sentences for nearly 80 prisoners on death row have also been commuted to life in prison. Mr Blackwood's sister, Angela Blackwood, said the family had been told that he would be released in the next few days "or it could be up to a week". It was not immediately clear if two Burmese men jailed with him were also being released. Mr Blackwood had posted a picture on social media of Buddha wearing headphones to promote a cheap drinks event at the Yangon bar he managed. Following complaints from monks, he was sentenced to two and a half years with hard labour for offending the Buddhist religion. The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Myanmar says that despite the latest releases, the country's outdated legal system - administered by often vindictive local officials - is still jailing people for political activities, usually unauthorised protests. On Friday, an ethnic Kachin activist named Patrick Khun Jarli was jailed for six months for posting a picture online that mocked the military. Amnesty International said the sentence was "a stark reminder of how prevalent repression still is" in Myanmar, and said nearly 100 other prisoners of conscience remained behind bars. Presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said on Facebook that a total of 102 prisoners were being released. One official said 21 of them were being released from the notorious Insein prison, which has long been used for political detainees, in Yangon, also known as Rangoon. Its most famous inmate was Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader whose party won the historic elections in November, ending decades of military or military-backed rule. Myanmar's former military government had been accused of wrongfully imprisoning about 2,000 political opponents, dissidents and journalists over the years. But since 2010, as it began edging towards democracy, it has freed hundreds of detainees.	A New Zealand man serving a two-year sentence for insulting Buddhism is among more than 100 prisoners to be released from jail in Myanmar.
Brig Gen Tlas, said to be in his mid-40s, is a member of Syria's most powerful Sunni family, which has given its support to the Assad's Alawite clan for decades. The general's father, Mustafa Tlas, was Syria's longest serving defence minister, who helped to ensure Mr Assad's succession to the presidency in 2000 following the death of his father. As a young man, Gen Tlas also attended military training with President Assad. So, naturally, he was a member of Mr Assad's so-called inner circle, serving as commander of an elite Republican Guard unit. The general - together with his wife - was also seen as a leading figure on the Damascus social scene, entertaining foreign envoys, artists and the media. But sources say he has become increasingly frustrated in recent months over the violent crackdown by the security forces on protesters. He was reportedly under a form of home arrest since May 2011, following his meeting with the opposition to try to start a political dialogue and also because of his opposition to the clampdown. The current regime, he once reportedly said, was taking the country to hell. Most of Syria's leaders are Alawite, but Gen Tlas is a Sunni Muslim, and his desertion may encourage other Sunni officers to consider their allegiances.	Manaf Tlas, a Syrian general, has deserted the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and left the country gripped by continuing unrest.

She is one of only two women on the Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates. Ms Shafik will step down at the end of February. She joined the Bank as deputy governor for markets and banking in August 2014 after stints at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said Threadneedle Street would say "farewell to Minouche with gratitude and regret". "She helped drive vital reforms on the domestic and international stages, perhaps most prominently in the successful completion of the Fair and Effective Markets Review, which she co-chaired," he said. "She has overseen a transformation in how we manage our balance sheet and is modernising our high-value payments system. This has been alongside the invaluable insight she brings to all three main policy committees of the Bank and the inspirational leadership she gives to her colleagues. In her work and by her example, she leaves an important legacy." Ms Shafik said it had been a privilege to work at the Bank of England and that it was impossible to resist the chance to run the LSE. "I have especially enjoyed connecting the dots and the people across the Bank's monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy responsibilities," she said. "I leave the Bank with a deep appreciation for its work and much admiration of its staff." The LSE is familiar territory for the former IMF deputy managing director as she earned a Master's in Economics at the school, which is part of the University of London. Ms Shafik, who was born in Egypt and emigrated to the US with her family at the age of four, is the first woman to run the LSE on a permanent basis and its 16th director. Prof Julia Black will continue to run the LSE until the new director starts in September 2017 after a post-Bank cooling-off period. US academic Craig Calhoun said in February he was leaving before the end of his five-year term as LSE director to run the Berggruen Institute, a political and philosophical think tank set up by billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen. Ms Shafik previously held academic appointments at the Wharton Business School of the University of Pennsylvania and Georgetown University's economics department. She was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honour's list last year. The Treasury, which is responsible for recruiting a successor, will advertise the deputy governor role in the coming months. The Bank of England has another three deputy governors: Ben Broadbent (monetary policy), Sam Woods (prudential regulation) and Sir Jon Cunliffe (financial stability).	Minouche Shafik, one of the Bank of England's deputy governors, is leaving to become the director of the London School of Economics.
On Tuesday the captain of a UK-registered vessel was fined £10,000 for unlawfully fishing in Manx waters. It follows the prosecution at Douglas courthouse last week of a Scottish fisherman who was fined £15,000 for breaching Manx regulations. Richard Ronan MHK said the "significant fines send out a clear message". The Deputy High Bailiff ordered both skippers to forfeit their catch of King Scallops worth nearly £5,500 each (about 90 bags). Both vessels were routinely boarded by officers from the Manx government's fisheries protection vessel Barrule before being escorted back to the island and detained. Mr Ronan, the Minister for Environment, Food and Agriculture, said: "The Isle of Man is committed to the protection and development of stocks of shellfish within its territorial sea and is vigilant over illegal fishing activity. "These significant fines must act as a strong deterrent." He added that the Isle of Man "welcomes responsible skippers" with registered vessels to sustainably fish in the Isle of Man's territorial sea with the appropriate licence. Manx territorial waters extend out to 12 miles around the island's coastline and contain a number of restricted zones.	The prosecution of a second UK skipper in a week for breaching Manx fishing regulations sends a "clear message to the industry," a politician has said.
US officials described the intercept by the SU-27 jet on Wednesday as "dangerous and unprofessional". Russia's defence ministry said the US plane had been approaching Russian territory and the SU-27 pilots had adhered to international rules. Russia is currently carrying out military exercises in the Black Sea. Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said the US Navy P-8A Poseidon aircraft had been conducting routine operations in international airspace when the Russian fighter made the unsafe manoeuvre. "These actions have the potential to unnecessarily escalate tensions, and could result in a miscalculation or accident," he said. A US defence official quoted by AFP news agency said the Russian plane had flown within 30ft of the P-8A before closing to just 10ft. However, the Russian defence ministry said fighters intercepted the US plane because it was heading towards Russian territory with its transponder signal - which helps others identify it - switched off. "After the Russian fighters got close to the spy planes for visual confirmation and to determine their wing numbers, the American aircraft changed course sharply and flew away," a statement said. "The Russia pilots acted in strict accordance with international rules for flights." Relations between Russia and the West have been strained since the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014. In April, the US complained that Russian jets had confronted one of its reconnaissance planes over the Baltic Sea in an "unsafe and unprofessional manner". In that incident, Russia also said that the US plane had turned off its transponder signal.	The Pentagon says a Russian fighter plane flew within about 10ft (3m) of one of its reconnaissance aircraft operating over the Black Sea.
The head of Madagascar's FA is the sole challenger to the Cameroonian, who has led Caf since 1988. Central to Ahmad's manifesto is a desire for improved governance, with a commitment to increased transparency and reinvestment outlined. The Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa will host the elections on 16 March. Ahmad, who confirmed his candidacy to the BBC on 12 January, has also said he hopes to bring about 'reconciliation within the different actors of the African football.' "Those who have lost their trust, their confidence in Caf, those who have been long forgotten and those who have been left on their own - they all must join Caf," his manifesto states. Among the other ideas prominent to his candidacy: Ahmad is seen as an outsider to depose Hayatou, who is seeking an eighth term in office, and is eligible to contest the elections given he is already a member of Caf's Executive Committee. The Malagasy has been boosted by receiving the backing of Cosafa, the southern African region. Ahmad is considered the most serious challenger in years to Hayatou, who was re-elected unopposed in 2013.	Ahmad Ahmad, the man bidding to depose Issa Hayatou as president of the Confederation of African Football (Caf), has unveiled his manifesto.
The Ulster county held a commanding 0-12 to 0-6 lead at half-time but the visitors hit back to claim a place in the third round of the qualifiers. Tipp rattled off seven points after the break to level the match as Cavan managed just one Niall McDermott score. Conor Sweeney's penalty and a second goal by Robbie Kiely sealed the win. Media playback is not supported on this device "I am gutted. I thought we were fabulous in the first half, playing some of the best football we have played this year," said Cavan manager Mattie McGleenan. "But you have to play for two halves, and we didn't. "In the first 15 minutes of the second half we just could not win a ball. Every breaking ball went to Tipperary. "I felt the referee gave them a couple of soft frees at the start of the second half and they gained a bit of momentum at a critical stage of the game. "Tipperary were hungry and their movement for the goal was class. We were caught ball-watching." Gearoid McKiernan, Martin Reilly, Tomas Corr and Caoimhin O'Reilly each scored two points as Cavan built that six-point interval advantage. But Tipperary started the second period strongly with four straight scores by Conor Sweeney, Kevin O'Halloran, Jack Kenedy and Brian Fox. McKiernan landed a free for the hosts but it proved a brief interruption to Tipp's scoring spree and they levelled through scores by O'Halloran, Kennedy and Philip Austin. Sweeney's penalty - awarded for a Jason McLoughlin foul on Austin - put Tipperary three points up, and when centre-back Kiely netted they led by 2-13 to 0-14. Cavan reduced the deficit with a couple of late points - but the damage had been done.	Cavan's All-Ireland Championship campaign came to a stunning end as Tipperary staged a remarkable comeback at Kingspan Breffni.
The boarding boat at St Davids RNLI Lifeboat Station takes crew to and from its lifeboat. But the vessel has recently become a regular sunbathing spot for a 7ft (2.13m) long bull seal. Dai John, St Davids RNLI coxswain, said: "His presence doesn't impact on our ability to save lives at sea at all so he is a welcome visitor." The boat is currently being kept on a mooring until the charity's new lifeboat station is completed next year.	A volunteer RNLI crew have been given the seal of approval from an unlikely passenger.
The posts will be cut over three years during restructuring after the £11bn merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management. The two companies currently have  a combined worldwide workforce of approximately 9,000 people. The information is contained in a detailed prospectus published by Standard Life on the deal. Managers said they expected "natural turnover" to account for some of the reductions, while other steps will be taken to minimise compulsory redundancies. The merger of Edinburgh-based Standard Life and Aberdeen is aimed at creating cost savings that could add up to £200m per year. The prospectus for shareholders stated "there will be a need to maximise operational efficiencies and cost synergies" to achieve the expected benefits of the merger. It continued: "At this time it is estimated that the integration and restructuring will result in a phased reduction of approximately 800 roles from the total global headcount of the combined group as at 31 December 2016 of approximately 9,000 over the three-year integration period. "Synergies will come in part from employee departures arising from natural turnover. "Other appropriate steps will be taken to minimise the number of compulsory redundancies, including the active management of Standard Life's and Aberdeen's recruitment and vacancies." The document reveals that the newly-merged company will be renamed Standard Life Aberdeen plc. Both companies have agreed on a 16-strong board made up of an equal number of Standard Life and Aberdeen directors. Standard Life chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone will be the chairman of the newly-merged company while Aberdeen's chairman Simon Troughton will become deputy chairman. Keith Skeoch, the Standard Life chief executive, and Aberdeen boss Martin Gilbert will become co-chief executives of the new firm. The two companies agreed the terms of the merger, which will create Britain's biggest asset manager, in March. Under the terms of the deal, Aberdeen shareholders would own 33.3% and Standard Life shareholders would own 66.7% of the combined group. A general meeting has been scheduled for June at which shareholders will be asked to approve the merger. If backed, the deal is expected to be closed by mid-August.	About 800 jobs are to be cut in a planned merger of two of Scotland's biggest financial companies.
Asif, 33, and Butt, 31, were banned along with Mohammad Amir after spot-fixing incidents during a Test against England at Lord's in August 2010. Amir, 24, is back in the Test team but Asif and Butt are yet to be recalled. "We are waiting for them to prove their case," said Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shahryar Khan. "They'll have to knock the door down before they are considered." All three men were jailed for their parts in the incident, which saw Amir and Asif deliberately bowl no-balls as part of a betting scam. Khan added: "Amir, from day one, has admitted his faults and apologised. "The other two didn't admit from day one, only once they were sentenced by the court did they admit. There is a difference there." Amir was given a muted reception at Lord's on Friday as he bowled for the first time in a Test since being banned.	Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt have been told they must "knock the door down" before they are considered for a return to the Pakistan team.
The Premiership winner tied the knot with Rebekah Nicholson at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire. Guests included stars from the worlds of music and football. The 29-year-old had already postponed the big day three times to avoid footballing commitments but will miss England's friendly on Friday. Fellow England internationals were all apparently invited but manager Roy Hodgson poured cold water on the plans. But he did give permission to the Foxes' Danny Drinkwater - as long as he made it to England training by 17:00. With England commitments taking up much of the summer, Vardy - who signed from then non-league Fleetwood Town four years ago - has said he will delay his honeymoon. Guests at the glitzy bash included One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson and Kasabian guitarist - and Foxes fan - Sergio Pizzorno. Vardy's Premier League-winning team-mates Wes Morgan, Danny Simpson and Marcin Wasilewski also saw him tie the knot along with best man David Nugent. Vardy has previously said it would be a quiet night for him as he prepares for a busy summer of football.	Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy has got married at a star-studded ceremony - after postponing his nuptials three times.
The first Grand Slam of the 2016 season runs from January 18-31 and the baby is due in mid-February. Asked if he would withdraw from the final in such a scenario, the 28-year-old Scot said: "I'm going to fly home. "I'd be way more disappointed winning the Australian Open and not being at the birth of the child." Murray, a double Grand Slam winner, said the current plan is to compete in the Australian Open and then take February off to spend time with Kim and the baby. He was speaking while competing in the Hopman Cup event in Perth, where he partnered Heather Watson to a 2-1 win for Great Britain against France on Monday. Murray put Great Britain ahead when he defeated Kenny de Schepper 6-2 6-2 in the men's singles. Watson lost to Caroline Garcia 6-3 5-7 6-3 in the women's singles to level the tie. Murray and Watson then beat De Schepper and Garcia 6-2 5-7 10-6 in a mixed doubles match decided on a champions tie-break.	British number one Andy Murray says he would leave the Australian Open early if his wife, Kim, goes into early labour with their first child.
Video gamer Felix Kjellberg, known as PewDiePie, suggested changes to YouTube's algorithms had affected the discoverability of creators' content. On Tuesday, a Forbes report named the Swedish gamer who now lives in the UK as the highest-earning YouTuber. YouTube told the BBC it had not made any changes to its "suggested videos" algorithms. However, other video-makers have reported the same problem, with new videos being viewed fewer times than old content. The "suggested videos" feed appears when a video is being watched, and recommends more content to watch. Mr Kjellberg said the feed usually accounted for more than 30% of his video traffic, but in recent weeks it had suddenly fallen to under 1%, signalling an undisclosed algorithm change. Other criticisms aimed at YouTube included suggestions that: Film-makers have argued that YouTube has made it more difficult for fans to keep track of their latest uploads, and for new viewers to discover their content, since the platform was acquired by Google. In a video uploaded on Friday, video gamer Mr Kjellberg said he would delete his channel when it reached 50 million subscribers as a result of his frustration with the platform. His channel, currently the most-followed on the video-sharing site, is about 200,000 subscribers short of that target. However, when asked by the BBC, YouTube denied that it had made any changes to its algorithms in recent months. It added that it had found no evidence that people were being unsubscribed from channels they followed. A spokeswoman said: "Some creators have expressed concerns around a drop in their subscriber numbers. "We've done an extensive review and found there have been no decreases in creators' subscriber numbers beyond what normally happens when viewers either unsubscribe from a creator's channel or when YouTube removes spammed subscribers." Mr Kjellberg is currently producing new episodes of his YouTube-financed series Scare PewDiePie, and on Tuesday topped Forbes' list of highest-paid YouTube stars for the second year in a row. His PewDiePie gaming channel is likely to reach 50 million subscribers in a matter of days. Mr Kjellberg suggested at that stage he would "start fresh" with a new channel, although some have taken his claim as light-hearted.
