The 26-year-old is expected to play five games for the Sixers before joining up with England's limited-overs squad in India. "To get the opportunity to play at the SCG is obviously a massive ambition of mine," he told the club website. Roy could make his debut in the game against Sydney Thunder on 20 December. He played three Big Bash games for Thunder two seasons ago. "Jason is known as an explosive weapon at the top of the order and we look forward to his contribution, bringing also his English experiences from which we can share," said Sixers head coach Greg Shipperd. England begin the limited-overs section of their tour to India next month.

Two men were treated in hospital after being stabbed during the incident at a Falls Road pharmacy on Thursday. Patrick Campbell, 26, of no fixed address, spoke only to confirm that he understood the 11 charges against him. Mr Campbell is accused of the attempted murder of Peter Wright and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on his colleague Peter McDonagh. He is also accused of possessing a knife with intent to rob and assaulting police. Mr Campbell faces further charges of robbing a woman of her mobile phone, attempting to steal money from a man and three further counts of possessing a knife with intent to rob on the same date. No bail application was lodged on his behalf at Belfast Magistrates Court, so a district judge remanded him into custody to appear again via video link on 5 May. One man, in his 40s, was stabbed in the arm and the second, a man in his 50s, sustained a stab wound to his chest, during the incident on Thursday. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.	A man has appeared in court accused of trying to kill a pharmacist during an alleged robbery in west Belfast.
The 24-year-old is on a season-long loan deal with Sheffield United and both clubs confirmed on Monday he will see out the campaign at Bramall Lane. Ebanks-Landell has scored five goals in 21 games for the League One leaders. "He has been superb and it's fantastic for us and him he will be here until the end of the campaign," Blades boss Chris Wilder told the club website.	Wolves defender Ethan Ebanks-Landell has signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract at the Championship club.
In a speech he said that he expected rates to rise over the next three years, reaching "about half as high as historical averages", or about 2%. But he added that shocks to the economy could change the timing and the size of any rate rise. Interest rates have been at 0.5% for six years as the UK economy recovers from the financial crisis. The Monetary Policy Committee will "have to feel its way as it goes," Mr Carney said in a speech at Lincoln Cathedral. He added: "Short term interest rates have averaged around 4.5% since around the Bank's inception three centuries ago. "It would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. "In my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year," he added. His comments come a day after unemployment rose for the first time in two years. "That suggests the Bank's interpretation of those statistics is that unemployment falls are now being held back by skills shortages," said the BBC's economics editor Robert Peston. "And those skills shortages are also responsible for rising wage inflation." On Tuesday, outgoing MPC member David Miles, regarded as someone who is cautious about the impact of rise, surprised markets by saying it was "likely to be right" to hike rates soon. On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the chair of the US's Federal Reserve indicated that interest rates are likely to rise in the US this year. That could be a few months earlier than in the UK if indeed the Bank of England were to move in the new year. If rates were to rise early in the new year, from the current all-time record low of 0.5%, that would be three or four months after the expected equivalent move by the US Federal Reserve. Now for those of you with big debts looking for reassurance that you are not going to be financially crippled by the increase, he has said two other things of note about the so-called Bank Rate. First typical interest rate changes, increments, will be typically much smaller than the half of a percentage point that they used to be before the Crash of 2008 - so probably one quarter of a percentage point, or even possibly an eighth. Also he has signalled that the new normal rate of interest over the medium term after a succession of rises over two or three years will be perhaps half the 4.5% over rate of the past 300 years. So nearer 2%. Read Robert's blog in full here	Bank of England governor Mark Carney has indicated that UK interest rates could rise "at the turn of this year".
Mustakim Jaman, 23, of Hudson Road, Southsea, has been charged under section five of the Terrorism Act 2006. He is the brother of Ifthekar Jaman, who was killed in Syria in December. Mr Jaman is due at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. Another brother, Tuhin Shahensha, 26, has also been charged with terrorism offences. Mr Shahensha, also of Hudson Road, appeared in court on Friday accused of planning to fight in Syria. He is due to appear at the Old Bailey on 14 November. The two men, of Hudson Road, Southsea, were arrested along with a number of other people in Hampshire and London on 14 October by the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU). A 57-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman have been released on bail. A 23-year-old woman from Farnborough and a 29-year-old woman from Greenwich, south-east London, have been released without charge.	The brother of a Portsmouth man killed while fighting for Islamic State (IS) in Syria has been charged with preparing terrorist acts.
Luke Mallaband, 23, was caught after a woman at the University of East Anglia (UEA)'s library in Norwich realised she was being recorded and reported it. Mallaband admitted six voyeurism offences at an earlier hearing. He was given the three-year ban and a six-month curfew at Norwich Magistrates' Court. Mallaband, formerly of Norwich but now of Yew Tree Road, Walsall, was found to be at "high risk of posing serious harm to females", a probation report found. Prosecuting, Louise Mantell-Sayer told the court a woman noticed a plastic bag in the gender-neutral toilet cubicle in UEA's library. The bag had a hole in it which lined up with a hole in a box inside containing an iPhone set to record video. The woman said she felt "disgusted" and "violated" by what happened. In defence, Dave Foulkes said Mallaband had no previous convictions and had referred himself to a mental health team in the Midlands. Police found 38 voyeurism videos on his phone filmed between July 2013 and February this year. He will also carry out a three-year community order, a 200-hour sex offending behaviour programme and was told to pay Â£170 in costs at Norwich Magistrates' Court.	A former student who secretly filmed women using showers and toilets has been banned from entering female and gender-neutral loos.
Lipstick Under My Burkha was earlier refused certification because it was too "lady oriented" and contained sexual scenes and abusive language. The film examines the lives of four women from small town India. The appeals board has given the film an adult certification and asked the directors to make some cuts. The film, starring Konkona Sen Sharma and Ratna Pathak Shah, had its world premiere in Tokyo a few months ago and has since then won several awards at global film festivals. The appeals board said the film would be granted adult certification with "voluntary and some additional cuts and deletions". It also asked the filmmaker to mute a few Hindi words - including one referring to prostitutes - from a couple of scenes, a report said. The Central Board of Film Certification had earlier complained that the film "has abusive words, audio pornography [meaning phone sex], and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society [implying it could hurt Muslim religious sentiments]". The film's director Alankrita Shrivastava had described the ban as an assault on women's rights, and challenged it in the appeals court. She told the BBC's World Tonight programme that the censors were "bothered" by the film's female point of view. Film censorship in India has always been quite erratic but the censor board has faced increasing criticism in recent years from the film industry, which accuses it of being irrational, making decisions on an ad hoc basis and being in conflict with India's changing society, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey. Last year, India's censor board had asked the makers of a Hindi film, Udta Punjab, to make 94 cuts, including removal of expletives, references to cities in Punjab and any shots of drugs being consumed, ironically in a film about drug abuse. But director Anurag Kashyup and other producers decided to challenge the order in a Mumbai court, which eventually allowed the film's release with just one cut - a shot of lead actor Shahid Kapoor's character urinating in a crowd. In 2015, the censor board asked the producers of Hindi thriller NH10 to shorten the duration of a violent scene that showed honour killing, had the word "lesbian" muted in romantic comedy Dum Laga Ke Haisha and banned erotic romance Fifty Shades of Grey despite the producers offering to make cuts. The board also shortened the duration of two kissing scenes in Daniel Craig's Spectre before giving it an adult certification.	An appeals board of India's film censor authority has cleared an award-winning Hindi language film for limited release.
It is estimated the new law could raise up to Â£1m a year for the Welsh NHS. The bill's sponsor, Labour AM Mick Antoniw, said it would help people whose lives had been blighted by "this terrible disease". The insurance industry has raised concerns, questioning whether the move is within the assembly's powers. Before becoming an assembly member, Mr Antoniw was a solicitor at the legal firm which has acted for many asbestos victims and their families. Speaking before the bill was passed, he said: "It is only right that medical costs incurred by the NHS should be recovered from those who caused the disease and used to give more support to asbestos victims and their families - for example, a cancer nurse costs Â£50,000 per annum. "We could employ an additional 20 cancer nurses or a mixture of cancer nurses and counsellors or additional research into the cause and treatment of asbestos disease. "It is my belief this new Welsh law can make a significant improvement to the quality of life of those whose life is blighted by this terrible disease." Last December assembly Presiding Officer Rosemary Butler certified that the bill was within the institution's powers, but admitted it was a "finely balanced" decision on some aspects of the legislation. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) wrote to her and the secretary of state for Wales with a number of what it called "serious concerns" about the bill's lawfulness.	A bill to recover the costs of treating Welsh asbestos patients from businesses or insurers has been passed by assembly members.
Regulator Ofcom ruled the performance, by Alexandr Magala of Moldova, was "in line with audience expectations". It also rejected suggestions the act might lead to copycat behaviour. "The repeated warnings and clear references to the inherent danger of the act meant it was very unlikely that audiences would attempt to copy it." Magala is no stranger to the ...Got Talent format, having previously appeared on the US, French, Italian, Russian and Ukrainian versions of the show. The 26-year-old also performed at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 prior to his ITV debut on 9 April. Audience members screamed and covered their eyes as the Magala slid down a pole with a sword lodged in his mouth, coming to a stop an inch above the ground. "I actually thought you were going to die," judge Simon Cowell admitted after the act was put through to the next round of the competition. The impresario later described Magala's oesophageal exertions as "the most dangerous act... ever seen on Britain's Got Talent". The same programme drew three complaints over its language, another three relating to animal welfare and another related to "generally accepted standards". These complaints will also not be investigated, according to the media regulator's latest broadcast and on demand bulletin.	ITV show Britain's Got Talent will not be investigated by the broadcasting watchdog over a sword-swallowing act that drew 33 complaints.
Chris Parker, 33, of no fixed address, was charged with two counts of theft on Tuesday. He was remanded into custody following the hearing at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court. Mr Parker was previously reported to have comforted a seriously injured girl and a woman who died in his arms. He was charged with stealing a purse and contents from Pauline Healey, whose 14-year-old granddaughter Sorrell Leczkowski, from Leeds, died in the explosion. Mr Parker is also said to have taken a mobile phone from a different teenage girl. He will next appear at Manchester Crown Court on 13 September. Twenty-two people died in the attack at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on the evening of 22 May.	A man who was hailed a hero after the Manchester Arena attack has denied stealing a bank card and mobile phone at the venue on the night of the blast.
The 5000-1 outsiders won the first top-flight title in their 132-year history on Monday when challengers Tottenham could only manage to draw with Chelsea. O'Neill, who led the club to two League Cup wins, said the remarkable rise "will live long in the memory". "Personally, I don't think we'll see it in our lifetime again," he added. The Republic of Ireland boss said Leicester's achievement rekindled memories of his involvement in Nottingham Forest's glorious run under Brian Clough in the late-1970s. "It's the greatest achievement, obviously, of the century, although that's just 16 years old," the former Northern Ireland international said. "And I think since Nottingham Forest away back in 1977-78, when I was a member of the team that came up from the old second division and won the [top division] at the first time of asking, this is the greatest achievement since then." O'Neill, who managed Leicester from 1995 until 2000, was full of praise for the Foxes' boss Claudio Ranieri for guiding the club to glory after they were tipped for relegation at the start of the season. "Ranieri deserves all the credit in the world, the players have been simply sensational, the owners have been terrific as well," he said. "It's been a great story. "Everything about it - from away back last year when they just avoided relegation, to this magnificent rise - it has been incredible and so romantic." Gerry Taggart, the former Northern Ireland centre-half who played almost 150 games for Leicester, said he hoped the club's triumph would change English football "for good, for the better". "I've been saying for the last six or seven weeks that I believed Leicester would go on and win the title," he said. "I've watched a lot of this team this season and it's just mind-blowing the way they've got to where they are. "The way they play football is good for the game." Taggart returned to Leicester in a coaching role after his playing career and had a brief spell as caretaker manager, and he said the way in which the club is run has helped drive it to success. "The backroom staff at Leicester City are first class, they've spent a lot of years trying to perfect what goes on behind the scenes," he said. "This is as much about them as it is about the players or the manager, to be honest." Taggart gave credit to Ranieri for his man-management skills that helped to draw odds-defying performances from his players, most of whom had never before come close to reaching these heights. "He simplified the game for them, let them go out, express themselves when they've got the ball," Taggart added. "But it's been especially good to see when they haven't got the ball everybody is contributing to the side. "That's what has got them over the line - pure and simple teamwork."	Leicester City's crowning as Premier League champions is an "incredible and romantic" story, the club's former manager Martin O'Neill has said.
Dr Margaret Ann Rous, who was 37, and her 28-year-old husband David Rous were killed when a light aircraft struck the ground in Glen Etive. The couple, from Newport-on-Tay in Fife, had been flying from Dundee to visit relatives on Tiree. The emergency services had been alerted when contact was lost with the Piper Cherokee at about 13:50 on Saturday. Police Scotland said the wreckage was discovered on the northern aspect of Glen Kinglass at 20:00, along with the remains of the two people on board. Dr Rous' sister Johann Maclean paid tribute to her on social media. She posted on Facebook: "Today has been the hardest day of my life, I love you Minnie xxxx" She also thanked friends and family for their sympathy messages. "Thank you all for the heartfelt messages, phone calls and visits," she wrote. "We appreciate your thoughts at this heartbreaking time xx." Following the discovery of the wreckage, specialist officers remained at the scene in the Beinn nan Lus area of Glen Kinglass. Inquiries are continuing into the cause of the accident.	Tribute has been paid to a Dundee GP and her engineer husband who died in a plane crash in Argyll.
First, he used a prehistoric technology: he lit a wood fire. But Prof Nordhaus also had a piece of hi-tech equipment with him - a Minolta light meter. He burned 20lb (9kg) of wood, kept track of how long it burned for and carefully recorded the dim, flickering firelight with his meter. Next, he bought a Roman oil lamp, fitted it with a wick, and filled it with cold-pressed sesame oil. He lit the lamp and watched the oil burn down, again using the light meter to measure its soft, even glow. Bill Nordhaus's open wood fire had burned for just three hours on 9kg of wood. But a mere eggcup of oil burned all day, and more brightly and controllably. Why did he do this? He wanted to understand the economic significance of the light bulb. But Prof Nordhaus also wanted to illuminate a difficult issue for economists: how to keep track of inflation, the changing cost of goods and services. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. To see why this is difficult, consider the price of travelling from - say - Lisbon in Portugal to Luanda in Angola. When that journey was first made, by Portuguese explorers, it would have been an epic expedition, possibly taking months. Later, by steam ship, it would have taken a few days; then, by plane, a few hours. An economic historian could start by tracking the price of passage on the ship, but once an air route has opened up, which price do you look at? Maybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing. But flying is a different service - faster, more convenient. If more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly, it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled. It was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires, oil lamps and light meters. He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial, using the state-of-the-art technology of different ages: illumination. Light is measured in lumens, or lumen-hours. A candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns. A typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that. Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days. Those 60 hours of work would produce 1,000 lumen hours of light. That is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes, although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim, flickering light instead. Of course, light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm, cook your food and scare off wild animals. If you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option, you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up. Thousands of years ago, better options came along - candles from Egypt and Crete, and oil lamps from Babylon. Their light was steadier and more controllable, but still prohibitively expensive. In a diary entry of May 1743, the president of Harvard University, the Reverend Edward Holyoake, noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles. Six months later, he noted: "Candles all gone." And those were the summer months. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the barcode changed retailing Nor were these the clean-burning paraffin wax candles we use today. The wealthiest could afford beeswax, but most people - even the Harvard president - used tallow candles, stinking, smoking sticks of animal fat. Making them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and re-dipping wicks into the molten lard. It was pungent and time-consuming work. According to Prof Nordhaus's research, if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles - or earning the money to buy them - that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening. Things improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded. Candles were made of spermaceti - the milk-hued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales. American founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong, white light they gave off, and the way they "may be held in the hand, even in hot weather, without softening", and noted that they "last much longer". While the new candles were pleasing, they were also pricey. George Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him £8, or well over $1,000 (£820) in today's money. A few decades later, gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs. They also saved the sperm whale from extinction. But they, too, were basically an expensive hassle. They dripped, smelt and set fire to things. Then something changed. That something was the light bulb. By 1900, one of Thomas Edison's carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright, continuous illumination, 100 times as bright as a candle, for the money you could earn with our 60-hour week of hard labour. By 1920, that same week of labour would pay for more than five months' continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs. By 1990, it was 10 years. A couple of years after that, thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs, it was more than five times longer. The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years. And modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper. Switch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create. It would have taken Benjamin Franklin's contemporaries all afternoon. But someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second. And of course our light bulbs are clean, safe and controllable - no flicker, pig fat stink or risk of fire. The light bulb has become an icon of innovation. It has transformed our society into one where we can work, read, sew or play whenever we want to, regardless of how dark the night has become. But the price of light alone tells a fascinating story: it has fallen by a factor of 500,000, far faster than official inflation statistics suggest. A thing that was once too precious to use is now too cheap to notice. Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

Back in the mid-1990s, an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with light.
The students began "feeling unwell" at Llanwern High School, in Newport, at about 11.40 BST on Thursday. One 14-year-old girl, five girls aged 13, two girls aged 12 and an 11-year-old boy were taken to Royal Gwent Hospital. Laboratory tests are under way to determine what the substance was. Police said not all the pupils required hospital treatment but were taken as a precaution. Eight of the nine have now been discharged. Gwent Police said inquiries were ongoing to find out the exact circumstances of what happened and where the substance was obtained. The Welsh Ambulance Service sent three rapid response cars, three emergency ambulances and an urgent care service vehicle to the school. A council spokesman said on Thursday: "Our immediate priority is the well-being of the pupils affected. "The school will be carrying out an investigation and will be working with the police into how this incident happened."	A 14-year-old girl remains in hospital after nine pupils were taken ill at school after reportedly taking an unknown substance.
Speaking in Parliament, Mr Javid said he was "wary of setting a precedent". Tata is looking to sell its loss-making UK business but the pension deficit is said to be hampering the process. However pension experts warned earlier that the changes could take ministers down a "dangerous path". Mr Javid has launched a consultation to consider the financial situation of Tata's UK pension scheme. He said the government was considering the proposals at the request of the trustees of the pension scheme and that any changes would need the approval of the regulator. He stressed that several options were being considered. "No decision has been made. We are wary of setting a precedent," he said. "This is very much about this scheme and this scheme only, in very unique circumstances." How steel workers' pensions could be hit One option under discussion is to base the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure currently used. This is the path favoured by the British Steel Pensions Scheme as they say it would leave most of the pension holders either better off or no worse off, compared with entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is the likely alternative. The PPF is a pensions lifeboat, funded by companies, designed to protect pensioners if their scheme were to go under. However, steel workers would be worse off under it. The company and the steel trade unions also welcomed the consultation, with the union saying that entering the PPF would be an "unmitigated disaster". "We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities," the union added in a statement. In total the British Steel pension scheme has 130,000 members. The scheme has a deficit of Â£485m. Earlier, former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: "The government is going down a very dangerous path. "Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry." Meanwhile the pensions expert Tom McPhail  from Hargreaves Lansdown said: "The potential deal on British Steel could rip a hole in one of the most fundamental principles of pension provision. It is well-established that pension benefits, once granted cannot be taken away."	Proposals to change Tata's pension scheme would be unique to the company and would not be applied more broadly, Business Secretary Sajid Javid has said.
Sir Thomas Winsor was consulted about Avon and Somerset PCC Sue Mountstevens' plans to "call upon" Nick Gargan to resign. The PCC says Mr Gargan has lost the confidence of the force at all levels, having been found guilty of misconduct. But some local Conservative MPs say he has been treated unfairly. In August, Sue Mountstevens became the first police and crime commissioner to say she would start the process of using new powers to call upon a chief constable to quit, a process which would effectively force him out. She referred her decision to Sir Thomas - her office has not confirmed his response. But BBC Points West's home affairs correspondent Steve Brodie said he understood the letter backed Ms Mountstevens' decision. Mr Gargan told the BBC he was unable to comment further. Now the decision will go to the local police and crime panel for scrutiny, although ultimately, Ms Mountstevens has the final word. Mr Gargan was suspended in May 2014, amid allegations of inappropriate conduct towards female staff. An IPCC investigation found those allegations were not proven, but that he had "repeatedly breached data protection principles" and had stored "intimate" material on his police-issue phone. An independent QC-led panel cleared him of gross misconduct, a sackable offence, but found him guilty of eight misconduct charges and recommended eight final written warnings. But his three predecessors as chief constable said he should quit for the good of the force. Announcing her decision in August to initiate the process to call upon him to go, Ms Mountstevens said his position had become "untenable". But MP for Bridgwater Ian Liddell-Grainger said Mr Gargan was the victim of a "witch hunt", and Bristol North West MP Charlotte Leslie said he had been tried in a "media court".	Moves by a police commissioner to force out her suspended chief constable have been backed by the chief inspector of constabulary, the BBC understands.
Lloyds shares fell more than 2% after it reported a fall in first-quarter profits, and ended the day down 1.6% Pre-tax profits at Lloyds nearly halved to Â£654m after it took a Â£790m charge related to high income bonds. The mining giant Anglo-American rose 8% after it said it had agreed the sale of its niobium and phosphates businesses to China Molybdenum for $1.5bn. Tullow Oil was the best performer on the FTSE 100 rising 11% as the oil price hit new highs for 2016 for the third day in a row. The Royal Bank of Scotland fell 4.4% after it said there was a "significant risk" that it would not meet the 2017 deadline to spin off the 316-branch Williams & Glyn business. The day had started with falls in most European markets as investors reacted to the surprise decision from the Bank of Japan not to ease monetary policy further. "The lack of action [from the Bank of Japan], perversely, proves that central bank stimulus still has the power to shock, both when it is tried and when it isn't," said Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG. The FTSE 100 ended just 2.5 points higher at 6322.40. On the currency markets, the pound edged up 0.4% against the dollar to $1.4597, and 0.25% against the euro to â‚¬1.2876.

The Daily Telegraph claimed Black had advised undercover reporters how to bribe officials at other clubs. During an internal investigation, Southampton requested the Telegraph provide them with evidence. In a statement, it said: "There is no evidence of any wrongdoing, as such the club now considers the matter closed." The statement added: "Despite numerous requests to provide the club with any evidence relating to the allegation against Mr Black, none has been forthcoming. " Black, 54, joined the Premier League club in June as assistant to manager Claude Puel. The former Aston Villa caretaker manager and Aberdeen striker denied the allegations.	Southampton have concluded there is "no evidence" to support allegations of wrongdoing made by a newspaper against its assistant manager Eric Black.
Met Police officers are also searching a property in Southwark, London, where they have found human remains. Westminster officer Gordon Semple, 59, from Greenhithe, Kent, was last seen on 1 April in the London Bridge area. Police said his family had been informed about the "significant development". A spokesman said: "We are unable to make formal identification at this stage, but this is devastating news for all those involved in the search for Gordon." Police who were called to an address on the Peabody Estate on Thursday afternoon found human remains, he said. He said forensic work was under way at the scene which may take some time. A post-mortem examination would be held in due course, he added. He said police would not speculate about what had happened or any possible motive at this stage, and would not speculate on the cause of death until post-mortem tests had taken place. On 1 April, PC Semple, who is originally from Inverness, had a work meeting at the Shard's Shangri-La hotel and left at about 12:30 BST. He was seen on CCTV in Great Guildford Street at 15:00 BST and his partner reported him missing later that night. PC Semple has no children but still has family in Scotland. The man under arrest is being held in custody.	Detectives searching for a serving police officer who has been missing for six days have arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Seaman William Williams was awarded the medal for his part in sinking a German U-boat during World War One on 7 June 1917. The new stone will be unveiled in Amlwch during a ceremony marking the centenary on Thursday. His family and local officials will be among those attending the service at Amlwch Port's park at 11:00 BST. Seaman Williams was on board the Q-ship HMS Pargust. Q-ships were disguised as merchant navy ships which would lure German U-boats in and then counter attack with their hidden weapons. HMS Pargust was torpedoed and Seaman Williams held the ship's heavy gun port in place for about 30 minutes until the U-boat surfaced and they could open fire. It was the first ship to receive the Victoria Cross (VC) from King George V and Seaman Williams was unanimously chosen by his crewmates to receive the medal. After his service in World War One, he returned home to Amlwch and later settled in Holyhead. He died in October 1965. Anglesey council chairman Richard Jones, who will unveil the memorial stone, said he "gallantly served his country". "We're proud to say he was from Amlwch and pleased to honour him with a new centenary commemoration stone," Mr Jones added. The ceremony forms part of a centenary commemoration scheme honouring 628 recipients of the VC during World War One.	The only man from an Anglesey town to be awarded the Victoria Cross is being honoured with a commemorative stone.
The cross-party group said speaking English was "the key to full participation in our society and  economy". They also said ministers should consider letting different parts of the UK set their own immigration policy. The government said it was spending Â£20m on English language provision. Last month a report by Dame Louise Casey warned of "worrying" levels of segregation in some areas and called for more English classes for isolated groups. The report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration urges the government to go further, saying all immigrants should have either learnt English before coming to the UK or be required to sign up to classes when they arrive. The group said integration should begin upon arrival in the UK and described speaking English as a "prerequisite for meaningful engagement with most British people". The government has promised new migration controls once the UK leaves the EU but has not yet set out a detailed model. According to the cross-party group, "substantial" immigration powers should be devolved to the UK's nations and regions, with devolved governments or city regions setting quotas. 4.1m population increase 2001-11 50%+ of the increase is due to immigration 2.8m people in Britain are Muslim - the biggest religious group after Christians 70-85% of the populations in some wards in Blackburn, Birmingham, Burnley and Bradford are Muslim 511 schools in 43 areas take more than 50% pupils from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds 27% of births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK It said replacing the current "one-size fits all" approach would lead to a "more positive" public debate about immigration. Addressing the "economic and cultural needs" of an area would "have a positive knock-on effect on the public debate on immigration", the report said, adding that this "could instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area, and give incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area". Pointing to a similar model in use in Canada, where provincial governments can set region-specific requirements for immigrants, it said visas could be issued specifically for certain regions or certain sectors. The report also called for a new national strategy to integrate immigrants, including "awareness of the host country's laws, traditions and culture" and access to the labour market, and for councils to set up local integration action plans. Net migration is well above the government's target of below 100,000, and ministers have said they will reduce it after the UK leaves the EU and is no longer subject to freedom of movement rules. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who chairs the all-party group, said a "meaningful" integration programme would be needed when the rules are changed after Brexit. He said: "It's clear that immigration has impacted on different communities in different ways and the pace of change has alarmed many. "The government has a duty to address the lack of integration of immigrants if it is to address this. Failing to do so has left a vacuum for extremists and peddlers of hate to exploit." The Home Office said it was not planning to introduce local visa arrangements, but the department said it had made funding available for more English lessons. A government spokesman said: "Our country has long been home to lots of different cultures and communities, but all of us have to be part of one society - British society." He said Â£140m was available through a "controlling migration fund" to help councils manage the impact of immigration. He added: "However, we must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services. "Our priority is to build an immigration system that works for everyone in the UK and delivers the control we need."	A group of MPs and peers says migrants should be expected to learn English before coming to the UK, or attend language classes when they arrive.
Concerns about plagiarism in a 2013 law module should have triggered a formal process, says the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. Instead academics reduced students' marks for "poor academic performance". The university says this was more appropriate as the problem was poor referencing rather than plagiarism. The QAA review found that academics at the university initially raised concerns about some five essays, or 10% of the number submitted, which had the fault of "quoting directly from a source and failing to insert quotation marks around the quoted passages". The university later referred to these sections as having been "lifted". However, the university's own inquiry found that the students, then at the start of their first year, had not yet been subject to rigorous training on avoiding plagiarism and had not committed any deliberate action to deceive. So instead of moving to its formal plagiarism procedure it "determined upon a mark reduction for over-reliance on 'one or two articles' and a subsequent interview with the students to explain", says the review. The university told the QAA team that having first entertained the possibility that the students in question had plagiarised, it then discounted the possibility. "It did not judge it to be plagiarism as defined in the university's regulations." It was "deemed not sufficiently serious in nature for it to be recorded on the students' records". However, the watchdog concludes that the reference to the students' lack of training and the view that it was not done to deceive appear to be mitigations of plagiarism rather than rejections of the possibility of plagiarised work. "The evidence appears to show that the level of 'suspicion' involved in the work in question met the criteria that should have triggered formal procedure." The review finds that the university had substituted its investigation and imposition of penalties for due process, "and thus was in breach of university regulations on academic misconduct". Any reforms to the university's regulations should avoid allowing course teams to make decisions in isolation which would risk "a less consistent approach to its management of academic misconduct", recommends the review. In a statement, the university said it took the matter of academic misconduct "extremely seriously". "In noting the review team's various recommendations, we welcome the conclusion that our procedures for academic misconduct are fit for purpose and conform to the expectations of the UK Quality Code; and that we are taking positive steps to educate and help our students to avoid plagiarism. "The university has completed a full review of its procedures, and will shortly be submitting an action plan to QAA detailing how we are addressing the recommendations."	The University of Buckingham breached its own regulations in an investigation into possible plagiarism, an independent inquiry has found.
The Glovers took an early lead but found themselves 5-1 down at the break before eventually falling to a joint-record league defeat. Skipper James Bailey told the club website: "We know we let ourselves and the fans down. "As a group, we want to apologise and give fans their money back." Boss Darren Way added: "Saturday was never going to be easy but the manner of the defeat was totally unacceptable and I apologise to the supporters and take full responsibility for that. "Paying supporters their money back is a collective decision - we're not happy with just apologising, but at the same time know our best apology will come on the pitch in the coming weeks." The League Two side will release details of how fans can claim their refund on Monday. Yeovil's players are not the first to reimburse travelling fans after an away day nightmare. Sunderland's players refunded the 2,500 Black Cats supporters who saw their side fall to a humiliating 8-0 defeat at Southampton in October 2015. In January 2016 Charlton's players did the same for the 166 who made the trip to see their side go down 5-0 at Huddersfield, in a performance that club captain Johnnie Jackson called "disgraceful". Earlier this year, Bristol City's players refunded the 312 fans who made the 386-mile round trip to Preston North End to see the Robins lose 5-0.	Yeovil Town's players and staff have agreed to refund the 258 fans who travelled to their 8-2 opening day defeat at Luton Town.
The 24-year-old Welshman, who competes in the F42 category, managed 16.14m with his penultimate throw against his able-bodied rivals, finishing fifth. It beat his previous best of 15.93m set at last year's championships. Davies is aiming to compete in the shot at the Rio Paralympics after his discus event was removed from the competition. The Bridgend man, who has limited functionality of his right leg with missing bones and no muscle or ligament growth, took gold in the discus at London 2012 and bronze in the shot and is the current European and world champion in both events.	Paralympic champion Aled Davies improved his own shot put world record at the British Indoor Championships in Sheffield.
Maj Matthew Collins, 38, from Backwell, in Somerset, and L/Sgt Mark Burgan, 28, from Liverpool, died on Wednesday when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. Their commanding officer said their loss was "a devastating blow". Their deaths take to 362 the total number of UK military personnel to have died in Afghanistan since 2001. Maj Collins joined 1st Battalion Irish Guards and had also served in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Northern Ireland and Iraq. He was the company commander of Number 3 Company, and leaves behind two children and his wife, Lucy. His family said in a statement: "Not only a soldier but a caring husband, devoted father to Freya and Charlie, caring son, wonderful brother and friend to many. We will all miss him and remember him always." L/Sgt Mark Burgan joined the Guards in 1999 and had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq. His wife, Leanne, said: "I am so honoured to be Mark's wife. I will always love my hero. "Mark was an extremely proud Irish Guardsman, dad, husband, brother and son. He will forever be in our hearts." The two men were returning to base from an operation aimed at disrupting insurgent groups in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. Lt Col Christopher Ghika, commanding officer of 1st Battalion Irish Guards, said: "Two more committed and professional soldiers it would be hard to meet; they epitomised what it meant to be a member of this family regiment." He said Maj Collins had played a key role in training Afghan soldiers, adding: "It is a telling fact that there is a deep sense of sorrow hanging over the 3rd Kandak of the Afghan Brigade today, such is the respect in which they held Matt Collins." Speaking about L/Sgt Burgan, Lt Col Ghika said: "The notes given to me by his company commander, alongside whom he died, say it all: 'Knows what has to be done, does it brilliantly and has the next thing ready before you ask'." The commanding officer added: "It is perhaps a comment on the character of this regiment that both Lucy Collins and Leanne Burgan are the daughters of distinguished and long serving Irish Guardsmen. "The events of last night are a family tragedy in every sense." Defence Secretary Liam Fox said both were men "of great experience and exemplary commitment". "They have laid down their lives protecting our national security, a loss made all the more poignant as they were so close to finishing their tour of duty and returning home," he said.	Two soldiers from 1st Battalion Irish Guards killed in Afghanistan just six days before they were due to return home have been named.
Emergency services were called to the Fernways unit on Cecil Road, Ilford, at about 22:20 BST on Saturday to reports of an assault. Two people found with stab wounds were pronounced dead at the scene. A 50-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody at an east London police station. Police believe the victims and the man arrested knew each other, but said they were not related and were not staff at the unit, which is part of the care provision of Redbridge Borough Council. Officers say they know the identities of the deceased and their next of kin have been informed. Post-mortem examinations on the pair will be held later, the Met said.	A woman in her 50s and a man in his 80s have been stabbed to death at a sheltered housing unit in north-east London.
Nicholson reported on the fall of Saigon in 1975, the Falklands War, the Balkans conflict, the Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He joined ITN in 1964 and was the network's senior foreign correspondent between 1989 and 1999. He died while on a cruise with his wife Diana. ITN chief executive John Hardie said he was a "true legend". Nicholson, who died on 11 December, presented reports from around the world on ITV's flagship current affairs programme Tonight. He had four children and three grandchildren. He was known for smuggling an orphaned girl out of Sarajevo while reporting on the conflict - and bringing her back to the UK, where he adopted her. The correspondent met nine-year-old Natasha Mihaljcic while he was working on a story about children being trapped by shelling in the Bosnian capital in 1992. He went on to write a book about the events which was used as the inspiration for the 1997 film Welcome To Sarajevo. Nicholson was ITN's first bureau chief in South Africa in 1976 and was the first television correspondent to live in the country during apartheid. He also witnessed the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad in 2003. Former ITN presenter Sir Trevor McDonald said Nicholson "was almost without doubt the finest television journalist of his generation". "His aggressive pursuit of stories came to symbolise what the new kid on the block, as ITN then was, was all about." ITV News presenter Alastair Stewart said he was "deeply saddened to learn of the death of ITN giant Mike Nicholson". Mr Hardie said: "Michael Nicholson is rightly regarded as a true legend of ITN. "As a journalist he is renowned and revered throughout our industry and beyond for his courage, his intelligence, and his compassion." In a statement, his family described him as "an amazing father, devoted grandfather, loving husband and dear friend".	Veteran ITN war correspondent Michael Nicholson, whose career spanned more than five decades, has died aged 79.
The service for the 74-year-old, who died earlier this month a few days after having a stroke, was held at St Peter's Church in Bournemouth. Stewart's broadcasting career spanned more than five decades. Fellow DJ Mike Read, actress and singer Anita Harris, and comedian Bobby Davro were among the congregation. Former snooker player John Virgo also attended. The service, which was led by the Reverend Dr Ian Terry, included the hymns Amazing Grace and Lord Of The Dance, as well as the song You'll Never Walk Alone. There was also a farewell address by the Grand Order of the Water Rats - an entertainment industry fraternity - of which Devon-born Stewart was a member. A private cremation followed the church service. Dr Terry said the service would "celebrate the life of somebody who just loved life". "It's a service of thanksgiving for Ed who, through the radio and through the television, gave enjoyment and fun," he added. Stewart started out as an announcer, film critic and rugby reporter with Radio Hong Kong. He was one of the first presenters on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967, and a Radio 2 presenter for 15 years - during which he broadcast from the summits of Ben Nevis and Snowdon, Mount Vesuvius volcano in Italy, and also from the Falkland Islands. On television, Stewart went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter in the 1970s and was best known for children's favourite Crackerjack, which he hosted from 1973 to 1979. He was also a longstanding presenter of children's show Junior Choice, which was last broadcast on BBC Radio 2 over Christmas. On it he coined his trademark catchphrase: '''Ello darling." Stewart is survived by his two children, Francesca and Marco, and four grandchildren.	Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of former BBC DJ and Crackerjack presenter Ed "Stewpot" Stewart in his hometown.
The TUC said its research showed top executives receive a year's worth of the minimum wage in just one day. It said the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and called for "reality in boardrooms". A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she had highlighted action was needed on executive pay. The TUC research indicated the median pay award, discounting pensions, of a major FTSE 100 director soared by 47% in the five years to 2015, to Â£3.4m. That compares with what the union body says was a 7% increase for average wages during the same time frame. It took Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP, the UK's highest paid chief executive, less than 45 minutes to earn what an average worker receives in a year, the TUC added. "We're seeing a growing disconnect between Britain's boardrooms and shop floors when it comes to pay," the TUC's Deputy General Secretary, Paul Nowak, told the BBC. Speaking ahead of the TUC annual conference in Brighton he added:  "Over the last five years, Britain's bosses have seen their pay rise by nearly 50%. "And at the same time, ordinary working people have seen real terms pay freezes, and we think that's unfair, it's not right, and it's not sustainable in the long term for the health of the economy." Meanwhile, the TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady, called on the prime minister to "deliver on her promise to put workers on company boards". She added: "This would inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms and help put the brakes on the multimillion pay packages that have damaged the reputation of corporate Britain." As well as promising to put workers on boards, Theresa May has proposed making shareholder votes on executive pay binding, rather than advisory. The prime minister has also said she wants more transparency about bonus targets and for companies to reveal the ratio between chief executive pay and that of its average worker. In a speech to the G20 group of major economic nations last week, she said: "To restore greater fairness, we will bring forward a consultation this autumn on measures to tackle corporate irresponsibility, cracking down on excessive corporate pay and poor corporate governance, and giving employees and customers representation on company boards." Professor Andre Spicer, from the Cass Business School which is part of City, University of London, says some firms are already coming under pressure to curb high managers' pay. He told the BBC: "We're beginning to see disquiet amongst investors at the moment so there's been pushback amongst big executive pay deals at places like Deutsche Bank, Burberry and a number of organisations. "So investors are beginning to become fed up with this. It's likely that we're beginning to see questioning of this widespread practice, that CEOs need to be paid a lot to perform well."	The pay of directors' at FTSE 100 firms has reached "stratospheric" levels, according to a trade union body.
Wreaths were also laid above the wreck of HMS Royal Oak to mark the 75th anniversary of its sinking. The warship was torpedoed by a German U-boat while it was at anchor in Scapa Flow in Orkney. Most of the 1,234 crew were asleep below deck, and 834 - including many boy sailors - died. The wreaths formed part of the first significant Royal Oak anniversary not to be attended by any of the remaining survivors. There are believed to be just three men who survived the sinking still alive today. However, families of the the crew, and the community in Orkney, have vowed to carry on the act of remembrance for generations to come. The Royal Oak, which also served in World War One, including the Battle of Jutland, is an official maritime war grave. The memorial service was conducted by the Reverend David Dawson and the Last Post was played by bugler Chris Bray of Her Majesty's Royal Marines Band Scotland. Relatives of the survivors and those who lost their lives were taken to the site of the wreck by HMS Bangor. Rear Admiral John Clink said: "It is entirely my honour to have been able to pay tribute to the 834 men who lost their lives in Scapa Flow 75 years ago. "And we remember, too, those who survived that tragedy, living with difficult memories of their lost friends from that terrible night throughout their lives. "The Royal Navy will never forget." Orkney councillor, Dr Stephen Clackson, whose grandfather Seaman Ronald Clackson lost his life at the age of 20, was at the service, which was attended by a number of Royal Navy dignitaries. "It's important to keep the memory alive," Dr Clackson said. "My son is only three years younger than my grandfather was when he was killed." "Being aboard HMS Bangor was fascinating and it gave us a picture of what it would have been like for my grandfather, seeing how enclosed it was and the thought of being trapped down there when the torpedo hit." The White Ensign was exchanged from the wreck for a new one by the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Group from HM Naval Base Clyde last week. It was later presented to Henry Blythe, whose uncle died on the Royal Oak.	More than 100 people attended a ceremony to remember the crew of a battleship which sank in 1939.
The deal is for the remainder of the current season, with a view to a long-term extension for both players. Hardaker, 24, has scored 67 tries in 155 games for Leeds and was named Man of Steel in 2015, but he requested a move to the NRL earlier in June. Segeyaro, 25, has played in only four league games this season. The Papua New Guinea-born player won the Dally M Hooker of the Year award in 2014, having scored 10 tries in 25 games. "Zak goes with out best wishes and I am pleased for him that he has been able to fulfil his ambition of playing in the NRL," Leeds head coach Brian McDermott said. "When Zak came to us to request a move, it was always going to be important that we were able to strengthen our group. "In James Segeyaro, we have a great opportunity to bring in a highly-rated player."	Leeds and England full-back Zak Hardaker has joined NRL side Penrith Panthers with immediate effect in a swap deal for hooker James Segeyaro.
Tech stocks had fallen on Friday and Monday, with some analysts saying that share prices in the sector had become overblown. But after dropping 2.5% on Monday, shares in tech giant Apple were up 1.2% at the close. Google owner Alphabet was also up 1.1% while shares in social media giant Facebook rose 1.5%. The tech-focused Nasdaq index rose 44.90 points, or 0.7%, to 6,220.37. The Dow Jones climbed 93.28 points to 21,328.95, while wider S&P 500 index added 10.96 points to 2,440.35, with both indexes setting fresh record highs. Traders expect an interest rate increase when the Fed concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday.	Stocks on Wall Street have closed higher, with tech stocks recovering some of the ground lost in recent days.
Prof Wendy Savage told the Mail on Sunday that withholding the information because of fears over sex-selective abortions was "outrageous". Some hospitals have a policy not to reveal the sex, but Professor Savage said it was a woman's right to know. She also said it was a "woman's right to decide" when to ask for an abortion. Speaking after MPs voted to introduce a bill to repeal an 1861 law criminalising abortion this week, she told the Mail on Sunday: "It's her body and her foetus, so she should have that information. Parents who want to find out the sex of their foetus can usually do so in a mid-term scan at about 20 weeks but some hospitals have a policy of not telling, according to the NHS Choices website. Some hospitals say they are too short-staffed to establish the sex and there have been concerns that the scans can sometimes be inaccurate. But experts have also claimed that the policies may be intended to prevent the risk of selective abortions. "She is the one taking the risks. "If a woman does not want to have a foetus who is one sex or the other, forcing her is not going to be good for the eventual child, and it's not going to be good for (the mother's) mental health," she added. Professor Savage, 81, a retired obstetrician and gynaecologist and a member of the British Medical Association's (BMA's) ethics committee, was speaking to the paper in a personal capacity. Under the 1967 Abortion Act in England, Scotland and Wales, a pregnancy can be aborted before 24 weeks if two doctors approve it. The law does not apply in Northern Ireland, where abortion legislation is based on the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The majority of abortions in England Scotland and Wales take place before 24 weeks, and are allowed in exceptional circumstances after that time. More than 90% take place at 13 weeks or earlier, according to the BMA. Prof Savage added: "The foetus is a potential human life at that stage (in the womb); it is not an actual human life... I think you've got to concentrate on the (rights of the) woman." Prof Savage said in her long career she had "only a couple of cases" of being asked to approve an abortion past 24 weeks. "It's not something women tend to do," she said. "This is another myth propagated by the anti-abortion lobby, like women wanting sex selection." She also advocated making abortion pills, for early termination, available over the internet, without it being mandatory to consult an expert. MPs last week voted in favour of progressing the Reproductive Health (Access to Terminations) Bill. It would remove criminal sanctions over abortion for women and doctors in England and Wales. A spokesman for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said although the comments came in a personal capacity they were in the context of the "BMA's exploration of further abortion liberalisation". And, he said, in light of a recent Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists event presenting widespread abortion "as a matter for celebration". "Such views have nothing to do with medicine, the care of mothers or concern for the sanctity of life," he added. A BMA spokesperson said it supported the current law on abortion, adding: "Though we recognise the diversity of opinion amongst membership, we advise members to act within the boundaries of the law and their own conscience. "Given the range of views on this subject, patients must be entitled to impartial and objective medical advice and treatment."	Women should be told the sex of the foetus when they are scanned during pregnancy, a senior, retired obstetrician has said.
The council will look at proposals to build a new English-medium school to replace those in Gwernyfed and Brecon. It also recommended a new school be built in Builth Wells, replacing the town's existing high school and the one in Llandrindod Wells. If approved, it is hoped the plans will cut costs and tackle the issue of surplus places.	Plans to overhaul secondary schools in Powys will be discussed next month.
And far from the mood since the general election easing on the matter of "sound money", the word among senior figures in the department is that now is the time "to hold our nerve". Sources close to the chancellor point out that plans to balance the books - meaning that the government only spends as much as it receives in revenues, mostly in taxes - have already been delayed three times since 2010. The present target is for the deficit - that difference between government income and expenditure - to be eliminated by 2025. Philip Hammond wants to maintain that plan. He sticks to a pretty well-known script when asked about increasing public spending. Government wealth, he says, comes from three main areas. The first is taxes - which, it is pointed out, the chancellor tried to increase in March, only for plans to raise national insurance contributions to be abandoned when it was revealed that it breached the Conservatives' 2015 manifesto pledge not to increase income tax, national insurance or VAT. Is increasing taxes any more palatable now? Second, borrowing - which the chancellor makes clear means increasing the amount of money that needs to be paid back by future generations. And, finally, an increase in the ability of the economy to create wealth - called productivity. It is this last area that is the most important and, conversely, the least open to direct government intervention. The Treasury - as much as it might want to - cannot simply demand that the private and public sector becomes more efficient at delivering goods and services. It takes time, money and training in skills - none of which the UK has a particularly proud tradition in. And anything that is done by the government - such as increasing investment in infrastructure projects like digital broadband or new railway links - takes a long time to feed through to stronger wealth creation, higher economic growth and higher government tax receipts. It is in within such classically "Treasury" parameters that Mr Hammond would like to see the present debate on increasing public spending considered. Today, pressure is growing from Cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove for the government to relax its approach to the public sector pay cap, as my colleague Iain Watson reports. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that every 1% increase in public sector pay would cost between £1.5 and £2bn a year. A pay rise for more than five million public sector workers who have seen their real incomes squeezed in the majority of years since the financial crisis is not cost-free. And private sector workers on average still earn 3% to 4% less than public sector workers - although their wages are now rising more rapidly and the gap is closing. Two of the major pay review bodies - for the NHS and for schools - have reported increasing problems of recruitment and retention in their sectors. That warning is likely to be repeated by the schools review body when it reports later this month. Last July, it said: "If current recruitment and retention trends continue, we expect an uplift to the pay framework significantly higher than 1% will be required to ensure an adequate supply of good teachers for schools in England and Wales." The police pay review body, also expected to report imminently, sees fewer pressures. "The general picture on officer recruitment and retention remains healthy," it said last year. "There are also no issues on the quality of applicants, the number of joiners is meeting requirements and attrition rates are stable." It does, however, say that "motivation and morale" remain a problem. The Treasury knows it is in a difficult position - and must be heaving a sigh of relief that the health service pay review body is not due to report until next spring. Abandoning the pay cap would certainly go some way to alleviating the standard-of-living squeeze felt by so many people. And would be politically popular for a lot of people. But Mr Hammond will have plenty of other pleas for increased funding to listen to. What spending demands might flow from the Grenfell fire tragedy? Should teachers' pay be increased, or is it more important to focus on raising per-pupil funding? Tackling both adds to the bill which someone - the Treasury argues - has to pay now, through higher taxes, in the future, through higher borrowing or via further cuts elsewhere. Such trade-offs are the stuff of politics - and the stuff of Budgets, the next of which is not due until November. Mr Hammond might prefer a period of silence from colleagues on spending commitments until then. But, with Parliament finely balanced and a prime minister relying on the good will of others to keep her in power, he knows he is not going to get it.	The Treasury jealously guards its role as keeper of the public purse.
Police had been looking for Mr Arnada, who ignored orders to surrender after being sentenced to two years in jail for indecency in August. He had first been tried in 2007 and cleared of all charges. Islamist groups forced Indonesian Playboy to close down after only a few issues in 2006. The Islamist Defenders Front (FPI), a hardline Muslim group in Indonesia, had said Mr Arnada was a "moral terrorist", and the group criticised the authorities for failing to track him down. South Jakarta chief prosecutor Mohammed Yusuf said Mr Arnada had ignored three orders to turn himself in. "We picked him up from Bali today to fly him to Jakarta", Mr Yusuf said on Saturday. Mr Arnada's acquittal in 2007 was seen as a victory of freedom of the press in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation where Islamist extremists launched violent protests when the magazine appeared in 2006. But the FPI and other Islamist groups lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, which found him guilty of public indecency after publishing a handful of issues of Indonesian Playboy, which contained no nudity. "We are being forced to act by the FPI as a plaintiff in this case", Mr Yusuf said on Saturday. The Indonesian parliament passed a controversial anti-pornography law in 2008, which was backed by Islamist groups. But the law also prompted protests across Indonesia, particularly on the predominantly Hindu island of Bali - a favourite destination for tourists.	The former editor of Indonesian Playboy, Erwin Arnada, has been arrested on the island of Bali.
It has been a long and controversial journey that began with Abid Naseer's radicalisation in Pakistan and ends in a maximum security prison in the US. But although MI5 and police in Britain have been vindicated by the verdict in a Brooklyn federal court, this is a case which has raised a number of uncomfortable questions. Why was Naseer not tried in the UK? This would clearly have been the preferred route given that Naseer, a Pakistani citizen in the UK on a student visa, was accused of plotting to blow up people on the streets of a British city. However, despite carrying out one of the largest ever counter-terrorism investigations - involving the surveillance of a dozen suspects, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to put any of the men on trial. There were emails between Naseer and a suspected al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan - allegedly coded discussions about a possible imminent attack on the city centre. But crucially no explosives or chemicals were found and no gathering of ingredients to make bombs. The authorities felt they could not risk running the surveillance operation any longer. Police were forced to move in more quickly than planned when secret operational details written on papers held by a senior detective were photographed as he was entering 10 Downing Street for a briefing. A subsequent report by Lord Carlile, then the government's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, found this would not have affected the issue of the evidence - but it criticised the lack of co-ordination between the police and the CPS during the investigation. Why was Naseer extradited to the US? This is one of a number of cases where critics suggest Britain is effectively sub-contracting difficult legal cases to the US - where juries are much more likely to convict terror suspects. After the decision not to charge Naseer, the Home Office attempted to deport him to Pakistan, along with those other arrested men who had not voluntarily returned there. But the High Court blocked it because of the risk he would be mistreated. At the same time they concluded Naseer was "an al-Qaeda operative who posed and still poses a serious threat to the national security of the United Kingdom". So the UK authorities could not put him on trial, could not deport him and did not want him left free to roam the streets. He spent a brief time on a control order but the dilemma was only resolved when US prosecutors announced they wanted to try Naseer in New York and he was extradited from the UK. They said - and the jury has now agreed - that he was part of a wider al-Qaeda conspiracy to attack Britain, America and Norway. Lord Carlile told the BBC: "In every case you have to find where the most convenient forum is for the trial. That will depend on where the evidence lies. "If the evidence lies in the United States, particularly the key evidence, then one would expect the trial to be in the United States." What new evidence did US prosecutors have? This has been a trial packed full of drama and interest. A string of MI5 officers wearing wigs and disguises were cross-examined by Naseer who was representing himself. He also went toe-to-toe in court with a convicted al-Qaeda terrorist turned prosecution witness, but the two had never met. The trial was the first to use declassified documents seized by US special forces in the raid on the Pakistan compound in which they found and killed Osama Bin Laden - the former head of al-Qaeda. The court heard how an FBI agent waiting in a military hangar in Afghanistan for the return of their helicopter, saw Bin Laden's dead body before it was taken for burial at sea. The agent's job was to sift through the seized documents. In a document titled Report on External Operations, one of Bin Laden's deputies told the al-Qaeda leader: "We had sent a number of brothers to Britainâ€¦ the brother determines what targets in line with what materials he can get." But none of the papers mentioned either Manchester or Abid Naseer. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Naseer's father, Nasrullah Jan Khattak, said: "It's easy to make accusations. They say my son is al-Qaeda but there was no proper evidence. The prosecution should have presented proof that my son was planning an attack." Instead he claims there was testimony from surveillance officers who had observed Naseer moving around the north-west of England, saying he looked tense while on the phone. "Whether he is happy or tense on the phone has nothing to do with al-Qaeda," said Naseer's father. US prosecutors were not able to significantly strengthen the case against Naseer - but he was not able to adequately explain the coded email exchanges with the alleged al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan. The jury did not believe his account that this was innocent talk about trying to find a bride. What would a British jury have made of this case? Well, that's a question to which we will never receive an answer.	Nearly six years after MI5 and armed police dramatically disrupted an al-Qaeda plot to launch suicide attacks on shoppers in Manchester, the ringleader has finally been convicted.
About 100 people were involved in the incident towards the end of Didcot Town's Southern Football League game against Hereford FC. Didcot said it was "very disappointed", while Hereford - leading 2-1 at the time of the abandonment - said it was "deeply concerned". BBC commentator Bill Rennells said "fists were flying everywhere". A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: "A 19-year-old man from Hereford was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence, and a 19-year-old man from Hereford was arrested on suspicion of common assault." Both men have been bailed until April. About 800 people attended Saturday's match, with the majority supporting the visiting Hereford team. Didcot manager Andy Ballard called it a "very bizarre day". He added: "I do have to commend the referee, he made a fantastic decision to call the game off. "He couldn't guarantee the safety of the players, the supporters and everybody in the ground, so he made a very tough call, but I think it's the right one." Hereford FC were formed in 2015 after former Football League club Hereford United were wound up in London's Royal Court of Justice the previous year. They are the best supported team in the Southern League, with an average home attendance this season in excess of 2,700. In a statement, the club said: "It goes without saying that Hereford FC does not condone unlawful behaviour of any sort and club officials will be working very closely with the local police, Didcot Town, the stewards who were in attendance, the FA and the Southern League to establish the relevant facts, secure all available evidence and conduct a thorough investigation." Mr Rennells, a journalist since the age of 14,  said: "It's something I've never ever seen before in my 71-year career. There were people being held back, and some people trying to stop it."	Two men were arrested after a violent pitch invasion caused a football match to be abandoned.
They were discovered after the Stena Line ferry from Cherbourg to Rosslare docked on Thursday afternoon. The four adults, two teenagers and two children are all safe and well. It is understood they were in what is known as a "curtain container" which had come from the French port. Three ambulances attended the scene and all eight were medically assessed and brought to hospital for check-ups but none of them needed further treatment. It is understood there was one family of six and two other adults and most, if not all, said they were Kurdish refugees. They have been brought to Dublin where their claims for asylum will be processed. Earlier this year, authorities at Rosslare Europort discovered 14 people hidden in the back of a lorry, which also arrived from France. All 14 people, including one juvenile, were found inside a refrigerated trailer unit. They did not need medical intervention either.	Eight people have been found in a container which arrived on a ferry into Rosslare Europort in County Wexford in the Republic of Ireland.
The letters are going to addresses whose waste is sent to Associated Waste Management in Shipley where the baby girl's body was found on 19 May. The site received 97 loads of waste the day before, 51 from Bradford and the rest from elsewhere in the county. Police hope an appeal by letter may jog the memory of a potential witness. The deliveries will be made to addresses in more than 2,000 post code areas, while a second letter will be sent to businesses to appeal to staff for information about the case. Inquiries have so far revealed the baby was a newly-born white girl who died two or three days before her body was discovered by staff at the Valley Road site. A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: "It is also believed the baby did not have a hospital birth and locating the mother to make sure she is safe and well remains a priority for officers." A team of detectives continues to work on the investigation and police have also been carrying out forensic work to examine other possible ways to identify the baby girl. Det Supt Sukhbir Singh, who is leading the investigation, said: "The answer to finding the mother of this child continues to lie within the communities of West Yorkshire and we are carrying out this new information seek to see if we can uncover new information to help us find her. "Any case which involves the death of a baby is harrowing and we are determined to explore all avenues to both identify this baby girl and locate her family."	Police are sending letters to 37,000 homes in West Yorkshire from this week in a bid to find the mother of a baby who was found dead at a waste site.
Swansea Community Farm in Fforestfach offers free access to a variety of rare breeds including sheep and bees, a healthy eating kitchen and café, and sustainable orchards. Organisers say their core Volunteer and Child and Youth programmes have some funding from external sources beyond March 2017. But day-to-day running costs do not. Founded in 1998, the farm has been an accredited Agored Cymru training centre since 2012. It has also delivered a range of courses in cooking skills and healthy eating, food growing, nature conservation skills and animal care. Phil Budd of Swansea Community Farm said the farm had fallen foul of austerity. "Everyone we speak to agrees that the farm is doing vital work in reconnecting under-privileged urban youngsters with where their food comes from, but when local authorities and the Welsh Government have to choose between us and, say a hospital, it's hardly surprising we are where we are now," he said. "All the available grants are for specific projects, but it's extremely difficult to get funding for the day-to-day nitty-gritty." It is hoped £25,000 can be secured from a crowd-funding campaign, and the same amount via grants, government and business. Organisers say that would secure its future for six months, while they look for a longer-term partnership. "It's terribly sad, at what should be our busiest time of the year, we're already having to keep one eye on the prospect that we won't be here this time next month," Mr Buss said. "Many of our sheep should be going into lambing shortly, so we've already had to start re-homing them, as we don't want to have to move them while they are delivering and suckling. "Hopefully we can welcome them back in the summer, but we all need to pull together and find new ways of working."	Swansea's only community city farm is facing closure at the end of the month, unless it can raise £50,000.
Coach Eddie Jones announced at the launch of the championship that the 30-year-old will continue in the role. "I haven't actually told him... shall I say now? I'd like to announce Dylan's the captain," Jones said. Hartley, who led England to the Grand Slam last year, was banned for hitting Leinster's Sean O'Brien in December. He caught the Irish flanker high with a swinging arm during Northampton's 37-10 Champions Cup loss and was shown the third red card of his career. The subsequent suspension took the total number of weeks he has been unavailable during his career to 60. Hartley will not have played for nine weeks before England's opening game against France on 4 February at Twickenham. When the captain was asked if he had changed his game in response to his latest sanction, Jones interrupted: "He's had 60 weeks off mate, he's a world expert." The Australian added: "I think he's ready. He trained well on Tuesday and has still got a couple of days to go. We're pleased to have him back. It's the continuity of the job." Hartley, when asked about his suitability for the role, said: "We did this last year, talking about me. I'm confident, I feel fresh, I feel fit, and focused. "I'm here on behalf of the team. The challenge is to use this week as best we can to get the preparation right for a huge first game." Hartley was dropped from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup squad after he headbutted Saracens' Jamie George, but was recalled by Jones after he replaced Stuart Lancaster. The hooker went on to lead the side to a Six Nations Grand Slam as they embarked on a run of 14 consecutive Test match victories. British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland has refused to be drawn on whether Hartley's disciplinary record will affect his chances of leading this summer's tour to New Zealand. Media playback is not supported on this device Jones attended the launch with a dressing on his face and a black eye, caused by a fall in the bathroom of his hotel. However, the Australian did initially suggest he suffered the injury while attempting the combat sports England players have been practising since October. "First we had judo and then we had MMA, so we're just going through all the martial arts sports to see what effect they have on the body," Jones said. "My mother always told me I've got to shave and I forgot, so I walked out of the shower to get the shaver and this is what happened." Back row James Haskell has been given the all-clear to link up with the squad after recovering from a foot injury that kept him out for six months. The 31-year-old was a key part of England's Grand Slam and unbeaten tour of Australia in 2016. But, having missed the autumn internationals, he faces a battle to oust Tom Wood, who was this week singled out for praise by Jones. Jones said people would "have to wait and see" if Haskell would feature against France in 11 days' time. "He has not had much rugby," he added. "He's played around 60 minutes against Zebre and 36 seconds against the opposition the previous week." Media playback is not supported on this device	Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley has been confirmed as England's captain for the Six Nations - two days after his six-week suspension for striking ended.
In October, the figure had fallen to 6.4%, having previously peaked at 9.3% in June. The average price of a UK home in November was Â£218,000, according to the ONS and Land Registry data. The ONS said the figures, which include cash sales, continued the "strong growth seen since the end of 2013". The local authority which saw the sharpest increase was Rutland, England's smallest county by population size, where prices rose by 20.7% over the 12 months. By contrast the biggest drop in prices - a fall of 7.8% - was seen in both Aberdeen and Inverclyde, to the west of Glasgow. Where can I afford to live?	House price inflation picked up to 6.7% in the year to the end of November, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Bow Street station closed as a result of the Beeching cuts in 1965 and since then a number of people have campaigned for the stop to be reinstated. The proposed new station would be built a short distance south of the original location, which is now the site of a builders' merchants. The scheme includes a park and ride facility for 100 cars. Councillor Alun Williams, cabinet member for transport, waste and carbon management, said it was a "very exciting idea" with "strong support" from the public. "Not only will this scheme provide Bow Street and surrounding communities with a railway station but it can also help alleviate congestion and parking problems in Aberystwyth," he said. Outline drawings of the new station will be on show at a public event, organised by Ceredigion council, at Neuadd Rhydypennau on 11 July between 14:00 and 17:00 BST.	A railway station could be returned to a Ceredigion village for the first time in more than 50 years.
The shadow chancellor told the BBC Jeremy Corbyn had shown leadership by insisting the referendum result must be honoured and the UK should leave. But he said Labour would not back a "kamikaze" exit which hurt the economy. Some shadow ministers have suggested they would quit if forced to vote for kick-starting official EU exit talks. Dozens of Labour MPs who support remaining in the EU could be willing to defy the leadership if it whips them into voting for Brexit in the event of a Commons vote which could take place in the coming weeks. The government has said it will notify the EU of its decision to leave, beginning two years of talks about the terms of exit, by the end of March. Whether Parliament is asked to approve the Article 50 decision hinges on a Supreme Court ruling, due on Tuesday, into whether MPs and peers are required to have their say. The Labour leadership have been accused of "dithering" over their approach and are under pressure to clarify whether they will oppose the government's plan of leaving the single market and the customs union and restricting EU migration. Mr McDonnell said the debate was polarised between those who wanted to overturn the referendum result and, on the other hand, those who backed a so-called hard Brexit and saw the UK's future outside the EU as a virtual tax haven. Labour, he suggested, stood between these two poles and supported a negotiated settlement with the EU to protect jobs, wages and living standards. "Jeremy Corbyn has taken a rather courageous position in that he recognises that you have to bring the country together at some stage and it will be over a traditional British compromise," he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. "Somewhere along the line there will be a sensible compromise and it will be Labour that is driving that compromise." Asked whether Labour MPs would be whipped to support the Article 50 process, he said the opposition had made it clear all along the referendum vote must be honoured. But he said Labour would seek to amend any government plans to guarantee the fullest scrutiny in Parliament and enable MPs from all parties to "influence the negotiations". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Corbyn said he would "ask" Labour MPs to respect the result while asked explicitly whether Labour wanted to stay in the single market, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the BBC's Sunday Politics that "in terms of jobs and the economy, of course we should be". Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now the party's Brexit spokesman, said Labour had suffered a "catastrophic loss of nerve" over Europe. "This absolute lack of clarity from Labour on the biggest issue of our times - dithering helplessly in the middle of the road - is only going to make their fate even worse." While he expected ministers to win any vote on Article 50, he told Andrew Marr he expected Theresa May to run into trouble if she "digs her heels in" in during the talks. The Lib Dems are pushing for the deal negotiated by Mrs May to be put to a referendum, saying the government had no mandate to "yank" the UK out of the single market. "Whether we like it or not the single market, the biggest destination of our goods and services, is a market place of rules," he added. "So even if we are out of it, we will have to abide by those rules. Once I think that becomes clear, the British public will start having some doubts." The Conservatives, which have promised Parliament a vote on the final deal, said Labour remained "hopelessly divided and confused". "They can't agree over whether we should leave the single market and have said they will also find new ways of frustrating the process of leaving," said Tory MP Maria Caulfield.	Labour would back a "sensible British compromise" over Brexit, John McDonnell has said, amid calls for the party to clarify its position.
Science and research should be a priority in the talks between the UK and the EU, says the Russell Group of research intensive universities. Any barriers "would be bad for the UK and bad for Europe", said the group's acting director, Tim Bradshaw. His comments come as the EU prepares to authorise the start of the talks. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due later on Monday to seek a formal mandate from the European Council in Brussels to begin negotiations. Mr Barnier expects the talks to begin immediately after June's general election. The Russell Group says there will be "no winners" if Brexit results in barriers between researchers and has pledged to work with "all sides to secure a positive outcome". Dr Bradshaw said there had been "huge breakthroughs in medicine, engineering, and any number of fields" as a result of joint working, which he promised would continue after Brexit. "We want to maintain the closest possible relationships with colleagues across the EU, and research must be a priority during talks," he added. He called for the rights of EU students and staff at UK universities to be guaranteed after Brexit. "We value our EU colleagues very highly and need urgent assurances, that after Brexit, they will retain the same rights to stay and work in the UK that they have now. "Nearly half of all UK academic articles result from international collaboration and EU member states are some of our biggest partners. "These relationships improve the quality of UK research and underpin the strength of our science base." UK universities are among the biggest beneficiaries of the EU's huge Horizon 2020 research fund. Non-EU countries can also draw on the fund if they contribute to it - but a major condition of countries being able to participate is allowing freedom of movement for researchers, a potential stumbling block in the talks. The Conservative party manifesto, promises to "collaborate in science and innovation" with EU member states. The manifesto also pledges to secure the entitlements of EU nationals in Britain and British nationals in the EU. "There may be specific European programmes in which we might want to participate and if so, it will be reasonable that we make a contribution," the document adds. Labour's manifesto promises that the party in government would "ensure that the UK maintains our leading research role by seeking to stay part of Horizon 2020 and its successor programmes and by welcoming research staff to the UK". The party also says it will seek to maintain membership, or equivalent, with European organisations that offer benefits to the UK such as Euratom and the European Medicines Agency. The Liberal Democrat manifesto warns that "the Leave vote has already started to affect existing and proposed research programmes". "We will campaign against any reduction in investment in UK universities and for their right to apply for EU funds on equal terms." Manifestos have not yet been published for the SNP, UKIP or the Green Party.	Barriers to research collaboration in Europe as a result of Brexit would harm scientific progress, says a group of leading UK universities.
Its 4G Super Voice enables customers to make calls and send texts using a lower frequency spectrum. Other networks are looking into introducing the technology, known as Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE). It currently works on only the Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone handsets will be added in the coming months. It is being rolled out in: Three said up to 5.5 million customers would have access to the service by 2017. Chief technology officer Bryn Jones said: "By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and be able to use their phones in more places than ever before."	Mobile phone provider Three has launched a UK service it says will improve reception inside buildings and in rural black spots.
Media playback is not supported on this device Wes Hoolahan gave the Republic a deserved lead shortly after half-time with a crisply struck half-volley worthy of opening the scoring in any match. Martin O'Neill's team had struck the woodwork and gone close several times prior to scoring. But, after taking the lead they found themselves under increasing pressure and conceded when Clark, chosen ahead of Richard Keogh in the centre of defence, headed a low cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic into his own net. The equaliser came from one of the few moments of quality from the Sweden captain, who collected a neat backheel from substitute John Guidetti and raced to the byeline before drilling in a low cross. Jeff Hendrick drew a late save from Andreas Isaksson but there was to be no winner at the end of a feisty, scrappy match the Republic shaded but could not close out. Commitment, passion and determination were much in evidence at the Stade de France, with those workmanlike qualities comfortably eclipsing any quality and finesse on show. But, in the end, neither side had quite enough to prevail and are left to ponder a result that is hardly disastrous but not exactly what either wanted. Both have remaining Group E fixtures against Italy and Belgium - the two favourites to progress - and have arguably missed out on their best chance to get a crucial victory. In a tournament with 16 qualifiers from the group stage, three points would have taken one of them a huge step towards reaching the next round. Media playback is not supported on this device The Republic lost all three of their games at Euro 2012, when Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni set up his team to try to stymie their opponents and snatch the points. Yet after qualifying from a group that included Poland and Germany, there was no lack of adventure and ambition here in Paris. Robbie Brady was a menace down the left, Hendrick struck the crossbar with a caressed right-foot strike and drew a superb save with a crisp shot from the edge of the area, and John O'Shea was inches from converting Clark's flick-on. There was also no disputing the quality of Hoolahan's goal three minutes after the restart. Seamus Coleman delivered a superb cross after a teasing, jinking run down the right and Hoolahan, who had found space at a premium in a generally congested midfield, superbly smashed home a half-volley from 14 yards across goal and beyond Isaksson. Hendrick forced another save from the Sweden goalkeeper with a low strike after his team conceded and the men in green showed enough to suggest that whatever happens to them in this tournament they will leave everything on the field. Ibrahimovic said before the match that "the legend can still deliver", but it did not look like it for most of the match. On many occasions - especially during the first half - the 34-year-old was drawn so deep in search of the ball that he looked more like a midfielder. Ibrahimovic, strongly linked with Manchester United, scored 11 of his team's 19 goals in qualifying, and going into the fixture with the Republic might have fancied his prospects against a central-defensive pairing of O'Shea and Clark. Yet he had very little chance to improve on his record of 62 international goals. He struck the wall with a free-kick, snatched a volley and was inches from converting a low drilled cross. But he was at the heart of the move that led to the equaliser. The unfortunate Clark had already gone close once to putting the ball in his own net with a header Darren Randolph did well to save before Emil Forsberg hammered the rebound wide. But Randolph could do nothing to stop Clark's header after Ibrahimovic had finally sprung to life and at least partially justified his top billing. Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: "I thought we were magnificent in the game with some really great football. "Of course the goal deflates you and there is disappointment in the dressing room, but I don't think the players should be downhearted with their performance. "I think they should be absolutely thrilled with the way we played." Goalscorer Wes Hoolahan: "The boys were unlucky but we'll take the point. We created a lot of chances. "In the first half we were excellent and at the start of the second as well. The boys should be proud of themselves, it's a great point in the end."

Goodes, an Indigenous Australian, is regularly jeered and racially abused by spectators. The #IstandwithAdam campaign was trending on Saturday, with actors like Cate Blanchett offering their support. Some fans have defended the booing, claiming it is not racist, but simply a response to Goodes' performance. Ms Blanchett and other high-profile figures, like actor Hugo Weaving and opposition leader Bill Shorten, have spoken out in support of the 35-year-old footballer. They sent videos to Fairfax Media backing the #IstandwithAdam campaign. During games Goodes has faced derogatory slurs and even been told to "get back to the zoo". Other Twitter users said the success of a native Australian should be celebrated rather than derided. The Sydney Swans star has described the abuse as "shattering" and is taking time off from the sport. Australian Rules football, or Aussie Rules, is played on an oval pitch, between two teams of 18 players. The Australian Football League (AFL) Players' Association and team skippers released a statement on Friday expressing their distaste for the constant booing, especially during last Sunday's clash at Perth's Subiaco Oval. "Enjoy the game, celebrate the success but don't boo, jeer or taunt players because of who they are or what they stand for," it said. Goodes is a vocal advocate for indigenous issues and wants to see Aboriginal people recognised by the Australian constitution. Others, including cricketing legend Shane Warne, have defended fans' right to boo athletes. "For me, I don't think that the stuff that they're doing to Adam Goodes is racist," he told Triple M radio station. "It's their prerogative. Australia can have an opinion." Separately, one of Australia's wealthiest and most influential businessmen, Crown chairman James Packer, said on Friday he was "ashamed" of the whole affair. "He's a great Australian. He won Australian of the Year, I think he's an amazing role model," local media quoted Mr Packer as saying.	Social media users have been rallying around Aussie Rules footballer Adam Goodes, after he became embroiled in a racism row with fans.
Southgate was delighted with aspects of England's display in defeat in the friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday while the unspectacular win against Lithuania was all about getting three more points towards World Cup qualification. So what will Southgate take away from the last week as England look ahead to their next qualifier in Scotland on 10 June? Southgate set the normal rules about strikers and age aside to bring 34-year-old Jermain Defoe back into the England fold four years after his last goal for his country, scored in a victory against San Marino. Injuries to main striker Harry Kane and all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney forced Southgate's hand but he was able to call on the hard evidence provided by Defoe's 14 Premier League goals in a Sunderland side renowned for not making chances and rooted to the bottom of the table. Defoe has always traded in the game's most important currency, goals, throughout his lengthy career. This was a performance designed to demonstrate to doubters and Southgate he has not outlived his usefulness at international level. He was sharp and saw one chance saved before he demonstrated his poacher's instinct in the penalty area to slide in Adam Lallana's pass in the 21st minute before flashing another shot narrowly off target. In many respects he is an old-fashioned attacking operator in that his first thought is always the back of the net and shooting at it. No extra touches or passes are required. Defoe had two shots on target, one off target and one blocked with very limited opportunities - but most significantly made England's breakthrough. He is selfish in just the right way and in a World Cup qualifying group where England will be confronted by the sort of mass defence Lithuania presented here, it is unlikely this will be a temporary return to the colours. Dele Alli was given heavy-handed - or more precisely heavy-footed - treatment from Lithuania as they tried to light the short fuse that has brought Tottenham's 20-year-old some unsavoury headlines in his short career. It meant Alli was nowhere near as influential as he was in Dortmund on Wednesday, where his efforts will have imprinted his importance for both the present and the future in Southgate's mind. With Alli subdued, this was the chance for Liverpool's Adam Lallana to step forward and confirm his progression into a fully-fledged first-choice member of this England side. The 28-year-old is a late developer for England but his rejuvenation under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is now reaping dividends for Southgate as a very important spin-off. Lallana has been directly involved in four goals in his last five England appearances, three goals and one assist, and was unlucky to strike the post in Germany. He combined natural energy and creation with subtlety at Wembley, the qualities needed to make a difference in an attacking framework with England - with his beautiful, imaginative touch inside a crowded penalty the perfect invitation for Jamie Vardy to make the game safe against Lithuania. If his Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and Tottenham's Eric Dier can provide a solid midfield shield for England's defence and freedom for those further forward, Southgate will hope Alli and Lallana will flourish even more on the road to Russia. Jermain Defoe showed exactly what a natural goalscorer can bring to England - which is why Southgate will want Tottenham's Harry Kane restored to full fitness as soon as possible. England have players who can score goals, as Vardy also proved, with Wayne Rooney not willing to take a back seat yet and youngsters such as Marcus Rashford ready to stake their claim. But Kane, still only 23 and with 19 goals and four assists for Spurs in the Premier League this season, is the class act Southgate will want fully recovered from his ankle injury to spearhead England through the rest of the campaign. Kane, and he was not alone here, endured a miserable Euro 2016 perhaps memorable only for then manager Roy Hodgson's puzzling decision to put a proven goalscorer (and a tall proven goalscorer at that) on corner-taking duty. He has endured a dry spell with England, with five goals in 17 appearances, but his performances at club level this season have shown further maturity and he has the sort of mature and measured personality that could yet mark him out as a future England captain. Kane is currently recovering from ankle ligament damage and is weeks away from full fitness - but in the long-term he will be a centrepiece of Southgate's plans as the man to take the opportunities England missed in Germany and against Lithuania. Burnley's Michael Keane has been the beneficiary of Gareth Southgate's willingness to move outside the Premier League elite with his selection policy and the opportunities that can suddenly present themselves at international level. Keane moved up the England pecking order when Phil Jones hurt his toe in collision with Manchester United team-mate Chris Smalling and had to withdraw from the squad before the Germany game - and got another chance following his fine debut with Gary Cahill suspended and Smalling an injury casualty for the Lithuania qualifer. The 24-year-old slotted in perfectly to a three-man defence alongside Smalling and Cahill in Germany and was an able partner to John Stones against Lithuania, although the lack of serious attacking threat from England's opposition in Sunday's game must be used as context. Keane has, however, given the impressive initial impression that he has the composure and concentration for international football and has been one of the major positives for Southgate and England this week. Media playback is not supported on this device Once again England's route to a major tournament does not seem to have an obstacle in sight - a familiar journey to what might prove to be a dangerous final destination. England and Southgate have no excuses for failing to progress to Russia from a group containing Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland, Lithuania and Malta and all the evidence suggests it will be as straightforward as expected. It was the same under former manager Roy Hodgson and England's untroubled qualifying campaign for Euro 2016, which brought an unblemished 10 wins out of 10 against Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino. England set off for France with optimism but only recorded one win against Wales before the embarrassing exit against Iceland in the last 16. The conundrum for Southgate is that the true measure of England's progress and test of how far they have come under his tutelage may only be revealed when they are faced with a higher-class of opposition in a competitive environment. One of Southgate's major tasks between now and what looks like certain qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia is to find a way of discovering just how good this England team is - and how to uncover any flaws before the serious business begins.	Gareth Southgate will feel a sense of cautious optimism after his first two matches as permanent England manager in succession to Sam Allardyce - but some familiar questions remain.
"I love writing, cooking and baking. I'm enjoying what I'm doing and I don't want it to be taken away from me," the Junior Bake Off judge told the BBC. When asked if Channel 4 had approached her about the show, which is moving from BBC One, she told Newsround: "No." Channel 4 signed a three-year deal earlier this month with Love Productions, which makes the programme. But judge Mary Berry will not move after she quit The Great British Bake Off last week out of loyalty to the BBC, a few days after presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins also decided not to make the move to Channel 4. Paul Hollywood is the only Bake Off star to have agreed to stick with the show and switch to Channel 4, so there is speculation as to who will present and judge the show. It was announced last month that Hussain, who won in 2015, was to judge the CBBC junior version of the show, alongside chef and food writer Allegra McEvedy. Channel 4 will begin airing the programme in 2017, starting with a celebrity special in aid of Stand Up To Cancer. Hussain was asked by BBC Breakfast about her views on Bake Off changing channel, but responded by saying: "It's old news. "Change happens, change comes, wherever it [the show] goes I just want it to do well, whatever happens, wherever it goes." But when asked about the importance of Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins to the show, she said: "Mel and Sue are so important to the show. Every time I was falling apart they'd come and say, 'It's just cake, come on you can do this.'" She added it is "the least competitive competition in the world" and that "you like each other, there's camaraderie in the competition, you don't see that anywhere else." She said: "You want to win and do really well and you want everyone to do well as well." The BBC and Channel 4 clashed over Bake Off on Tuesday at the Royal Television Society London Conference. James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy and education was in a debate with Channel 4's chief creative officer Jay Hunt. Hunt said: "I understand that you feel aggrieved about Bake Off although it is worth remembering the BBC lost Bake Off. Channel 4 didn't take Bake Off." Purnell told her: "You have a remit which you describe yourself as 'born risky'. I think there's real questions about whether buying Bake Off qualifies for that." The Great British Bake Off began life on BBC Two in 2010, where it became a firm favourite with viewers before moving to BBC One in 2014. Last year's final was the UK's most watched television programme of the year, with 13.4 million viewers tuning in to see Hussain win the competition.

British Transport Police (BTP) said there were 150 fewer incidents recorded in 2014/15, but sex attacks rose by 16% from 19 to 22. Overall, 1,172 crimes were reported - down on 1,322 the previous year. BTP said crime in Wales remained low, but there was still much for the force to do. Supt Andy Morgan, sub divisional commander for Wales, said sex crime figures in the region were the lowest of any of BTP's eight areas. He said although it was concerning so many people were affected by this type of crime, the force had expected to see a rise after launching its Report It To Stop It campaign, which encourages victims to come forward. The force said there were 42 fewer theft offences last year and instances where cables were stolen were down from 102 last year to 53 this year. As a result, the number of travel minutes lost to the offence is down by 87% nationally since 2008/09. Violent offences also decreased in Wales, at a time when there was an 8% rise across Britain. The force said it had put more officers on night trains to deter problem behaviour and it was enhancing its CCTV coverage by trialling the use of body-worn cameras. The report said there were 16 deaths on the tracks in Wales last year and BTP had introduced a hotline for staff to alert emergency services when staff are concerned about a person planning to harm themselves.	Crime on the railways fell by 11% in Wales last year, while the number of sexual offences reported rose, new figures show.
The programme was started after a number of attacks and attempted rapes. A police official said women and children were being taught basic judo and how to punch and kick. Police say there are around 100,000 people in camps in Kathmandu following the devastating earthquake in April. "When we visited these temporary shelters we found there had been violence against women and children," said Tara Devi Thapa, deputy superintendent of police in the Kathmandu Valley. "We thought it was a good idea to give them a skill so they can use it and benefit," she said. Ms Thapa said around 70 women and girls in one camp in the Boudha area of the city were being taught how to do judo holds as well as how to kick and punch. She said there had been a high demand from earthquake victims to learn how to defend themselves, and the police were considering offering the programme in all camps in the capital. "We expect the amount of violence women and children face to increase as time goes on," said Ms Thapa. "We think the shelters could be targeted by criminal and trafficking gangs," she said. Hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless by the 7.8 magnitude quake and resulting aftershocks. Many of these people face a long stay in temporary shelters before they can rebuild their homes.	The Nepalese police say they are giving self-defence classes to women and children earthquake survivors who are living in temporary shelters in the capital Kathmandu.
Woolf Works - based both on her life and the novels Orlando, The Waves and Mrs Dalloway - will premiere in summer 2015, choreographed by Wayne McGregor. McGregor told the BBC the piece would "break the rules" of narrative ballet. The season will also include new works by Hofesh Shechter and Philip Glass, whose chamber opera The Trial is based on the Kafka novel of the same name. The Czech author's original story tells of Josef K, who is arrested and tried for a crime without ever being told what the charges against him are. Glass, who has worked with Music Theatre Wales on the piece, said: "I think of my pocket operas as neutron bombs - small, but packing a terrific punch". McGregor, who is the Royal Ballet's resident choreographer, said he had been inspired to apply Virginia Woolf's narrative style to full-length ballet. "Her writing lends itself to the breaking of rules, in terms of how words are organised, or thoughts are organised. I thought that was a perfect filter to create something new." "We're going to be able to find a way of mashing up, splicing and going back-and-forward through periods of time in a way that will hopefully be really evocative, and a different way of experiencing ballet". Israeli choreographer Shechter is described by the ROH as "one of the UK's most exciting contemporary artists". However, The Guardian's dance critic, Judith Mackrell, has suggested his choreography is "the physical and aesthetic opposite of the Royal's classical style". The first collaboration between the two will be unveiled as part of a triple bill in March 2015. Other highlights include an evening of works by Frederick Ashton, founder choreographer of The Royal Ballet. The programme will feature Scenes de ballet, Ashton's own personal favourite amongst his works; Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan; A Month in the Country and Symphonic Variations, which he created for his muse Margot Fonteyn. Carlos Acosta's Don Quixote will be revived, while the Christmas production will be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which will also be screened live in cinemas on 16 December. Manon, one of the company's signature ballets, will open the season, marking the 40th anniversary of Kenneth MacMillan's original production. "Manon is a firm favourite with audiences and, I have to say, the dancers," said Royal Opera House director Kevin O'Hare. "Every ballerina would love to be Manon, so we have a huge range of dancers portraying that role." Female choreographers' works are appearing at the venue's second, smaller venue, The Linbury, where Kate Prince, Kristen McNally and Shobana Jeyasingh will all premiere new works. The opera programme includes Placido Domingo in Verdi's I due Foscari, as well as Stephen Gould and Nina Stemme taking the title roles in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. At a press launch for the new season, one reporter challenged the institution over the programme, noting that almost half of the performances stemmed from three composers - Verdi, Puccini and Rossini. "It's true," said Kasper Holten, the Director of Opera at ROH. "But we have to acknowledge the fact that there is a big demand out there for certain composers." "We offer works by all kinds of composers [but] in order to make our business model work, with the cuts you all know have happened... we have to think of the market." "For me, as long as we get the mix of titles right, then having to be savvy about the number of performances we do of each title, that is, for me, a fair way to do it."	A ballet inspired by Virginia Woolf will be the centrepiece of the 2014/15 season at the Royal Opera House.
Operations are due to resume early next week after a meeting between NHS bosses and other partners on Thursday night. Data suggested death rates there were double that of other centres, but experts have questioned their accuracy. However, the Department of Health (DoH) said the NHS was right to investigate safety at the unit. A spokesperson said: "We support NHS England and the trust in their decision to suspend surgery last week on the basis that there were serious concerns that needed to be investigated. "If the trust and the regulators are content that these concerns can now be explained or addressed then we would support a joint decision to resume surgery." Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said work would be done over the weekend to give "sufficient assurance" the unit is safe to reopen, early next week. Doctors and other medical experts said the data on death rates had not been verified and was not fit to base a decision to close the unit on. Mortality data and staffing are just two of the concerns being looked at as part of a review into why children's cardiac surgery at Leeds General Infirmary was suspended last Thursday. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission have all been involved. The indication is that if the trust can provide strong assurances that heart surgery is safe, then the unit could reopen early next week. But discussions will continue over the weekend as part of the review, which is expected to last three weeks. If the unit does reopen, Leeds General Infirmary will have to reassure patients and families that safety of care is paramount. The NHS can ill afford another scandal after Mid Staffs. Yet Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will probably have the last say on the future of children's heart services, at Leeds and elsewhere. A separate independent review is set to report to him on the whole restructuring of children's heart services in England. But, Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said the figures were among a "constellation of reasons" the decision was made.  He has been backed by health secretary Jeremy Hunt. A senior Westminster source has told the BBC that "as far as the secretary of state is concerned, Sir Bruce Keogh was right to ask questions about the safety of heart surgery at the unit". Parents had criticised the timing of the suspension of surgery at the unit, which came 24 hours after a High Court judge ruled that a decision-making process to close it as part of an England-wide reorganisation of services was "legally flawed". Stuart Andrew, the Conservative MP for Pudsey, called for "some really serious investigating" into the decision to suspend surgery. Mr Andrew claimed a review of the mortality figures showed "Leeds is within the average and is a safe unit to use". He said recent events raised questions about the NHS decision to close the Leeds unit for good and concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer centres. "We are losing faith in that review process," said Mr Andrew. "Some of these people are the same people on that decision-making body." Lois Brown, whose five-year-old daughter had life-saving heart treatment at the hospital, described the decision to restart surgery as "fantastic". Ms Brown has been involved in the campaign and court action to save the unit from closure. She said she wanted answers as to why the unit was shut. "I'm really relieved that children are going to get surgery at Leeds again," she said. "For the past week and a bit we have been putting children's lives at risk for no reason, apparently."	Children's heart surgery is set to restart at Leeds General Infirmary, a week after it was claimed data showed higher-than-usual death rates there.
Andrew Nay, 39, crashed his Land Rover into the girls' family car as he made a right turn across oncoming traffic on the A509 near Wellingborough. Katrina Raiba, now six, and her sister Karlina, eight, were left paralysed from the waist down. The girls' parents said they would "never be able to forgive" Nay. Live: Reaction to sentencing of Andrew Nay Northampton Crown Court was told Nay, a Jaguar Land Rover manager and off-road driving instructor, was tailgating and "bullying" a woman who had been driving a Mazda. To get away from him during his pursuit in October last year, she safely turned right onto the B547 towards Little Harrowden. Nay, who was seen laughing with his male passenger, undertook a Mercedes and then, in an attempt to follow the Mazda, made an "absolutely ridiculous" turn, the court heard. He hit the family's Vauxhall Signum that was travelling along the A509 in the opposite direction. The girls' parents, Roberts Raibais and Renate Raiba, released a statement saying: "Andrew Nay's reckless actions had devastating consequences for our two beautiful daughters. "Katrina and Karlina were happy, active children and he has robbed them of that.  We will never be able to forgive him. "Every day they ask 'when will we start feeling our legs again?' They think it's going to get better and it's too hard to tell them." Nay, from Weldon, Corby, admitted four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, but denied he had been chasing the Mazda prior to the crash. Judge Adrienne Lucking QC said: "This was a prolonged, persistent and deliberate course of very bad driving. "No sentence I can pass will ever feel like enough for this family." The judge told Nay his account of events had been "incredible and inconsistent". Sgt Tony Hopkins, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit in Northamptonshire, said: "This is probably one of the most tragic cases that I think I've had to deal with in my career to date. "There is no end for the family, this will go on for years and this will affect them for years." He added: "I'm pleased to see that the judge has been able to see through Mr Nay's story, and has been able to see what the witnesses have evidenced to us over the few months, to highlight how long this incident actually went on for." Jaguar Land Rover' said in a statement: "We are deeply saddened by this terrible incident and our thoughts are with the Raiba family. We can confirm that Andrew Nay is no longer an employee of Jaguar Land Rover."	A driving instructor who left two young sisters paralysed after a "road rage" crash in Northamptonshire has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.
Representatives from the west of Norway have been in the isles to discuss how expertise can be shared. They believe knowledge built up in Scandinavia through work in the oil and gas sector could prove key to the next stage in developing technologies. Orkney is a major Scottish hub for renewables. In January, plans for a Â£6.5m research and innovation campus in Stromness in Orkney took a step forward after the organisations driving the project agreed funding. Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Orkney Islands Council are behind the venture. The campus is aimed at supporting sectors including marine renewables.	A partnership is being formed between the energy sectors in Orkney and Norway to look at ways they can work together to develop marine renewables.
Jamieson, who lost his place to on-loan Rangers 20-year-old Liam Kelly, had been sent out on loan to junior outfit Bo'ness United earlier this month. He would become Accies' third goalkeeping addition of the summer. Gary Woods was signed permanently from Leyton Orient and Remi Matthews on loan from Norwich City. The Premiership club lost Michael McGovern to Norwich this summer after his Euro 2016 displays for Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, 16-year-old Jon McCracken followed him from New Douglas Park to Carrow Road earlier this month. Jamieson had made 101 appearances for Livingston, 16 while they were in the Championship last season.	Goalkeeper Darren Jamieson has been released by Livingston, with the League One club saying that the 25-year-old is to join Hamilton Academical.
The former Scottish first minister will be in the Belgian capital to collect the first Coppieters Award. A spokesman for Mr Salmond said last week that he would meet Mr Juncker ahead of the awards ceremony. It comes as the Scottish government prepares to publish its proposals for keeping Scotland in the single market after Brexit. Mr Salmond's successor as first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Juncker in Brussels in June. Speaking at the time, Mr Juncker said Scotland had "won the right to be heard in Brussels" and that he would listen carefully to what Ms Sturgeon had to say. But he stressed that he would not "interfere in an inner British process". The request for a meeting with Mr Juncker was made by Mr Salmond, who will receive the Coppieters Award in recognition of his "dedication and advocacy for Scotland's right to redefine its political future among a European family of nations". The Scottish government is exploring potential options for keeping Scotland in the European single market even if the UK as a whole leaves, with its proposals expected to be published next week. The EU has previously said it will only negotiate a deal with the UK government once Article 50 is triggered and the formal process of leaving the EU begins. The UK Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said earlier this month that a special Brexit deal for Scotland was "not realistic". He also said he wanted to work closely with the Scottish government and the other devolved administrations in order to "secure the best possible deal" for all parts of the UK.	Alex Salmond is expected to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels later.
Sixteen candidates stood for 16 vacancies on the island's government the Chief Pleas last December, so there was no vote. Howard Knight, who was commissioned by the Chief Pleas to oversee the election, said it was not a good result for democracy. The Chief Pleas said his report would be discussed next month. The Chief Pleas has a total of 28 members or conseillers which govern Sark, one of the smallest of the Channel Islands, with a population of about 600. Instead of the election, there was a ballot on which candidates would serve for four years and which would serve two. However, Mr Knight said he found that there was no "conspiracy" and that the unusual situation was a coincidence.	Sark needs to improve the health of its democracy, says an election observer after the last election was scrapped.
The company blamed the general election for contributing to a sharp fall in demand in the second half of its financial year. It now expects its underlying annual profits to be between Â£82m-Â£87m, below the Â£94.4m it reported in the previous 12 months. Its share price tumbled by 55.25p to 196.75p DFS said the market-wide trend was linked to uncertainty regarding the general election and "uncertain macroeconomic environment". It said it had seen "significant declines in store footfall leading to a material reduction in customer orders". Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said that the slowdown reported by DFS was "not surprising" given recent economic data. "CPI inflation has accelerated to 2.9%, while wage growth is slowing. Real wages are falling. If the gap continues to widen then the likes of DFS could suffer further as spending takes a knock. Undoubtedly the uncertainty around the general election and Brexit means people are delaying big ticket purchases," he said. DFS said it experienced short-term fluctuations to demand and, confident of longer-term growth, had maintained its investment levels. But Mr Wilson said: "The relative resilience of the UK in the six months after the referendum, and comparative slowing thereafter, seems to be mirrored in the fortunes of DFS."	Shares in DFS Furniture have plunged by 22% after the sofa specialist issued a profit warning.
The 1917 Fowler engine, worth £250,000, came off the trailer in Crays Hill, Essex just missing an electric pylon. The engine was being returned from its inaugural appearance, following a full restoration, at Young Farmers event near Chelmsford. "The primary thing is that no-one was hurt," said the owners. Phil Burrows, from Barleylands farm park, who owns the Panther said they were "unsure" what caused the incident at about 19:00 BST on Sunday. "I got the scene and wanted to make sure no-one was hurt and the lorry diver was OK. Machines and metal can be replaced but people can't. "The driver was devastated and the chap who looks after it was a bit distraught at the state of his poor old engine." The engine had been "lovingly restored from a wreck to working condition" over the last five years, had "just finished its repair" and was on "its first outing before our country show in September," said Mr Burrows. "It took about two hours with three cranes to right it and then another hour to get it onto the low-loader. "All the steering arms were bent so you couldn't steer it. Due to its age and value, we had to spend a lot of time working out how to lift it as not to exacerbate the damage. "With a steam engine you cant just buy something off the shelf everything has to be handmade so a lot of craft work and skill goes into it." The engine's flywheel, boiler and steering mechanism were damaged in the accident.	A 21-tonne steam engine that tipped off a low-loader and "slid down a road" could cost more than £100,000 to repair, its owners said.

Water UK, which represents all major UK water suppliers, said the shale gas extraction method posed a threat if not "carefully planned and carried out". It also warned fracking's "huge" use of water could cause shortages in areas of low supply, like South East England. Shale gas company Cuadrilla said there were no proven cases of aquifers being contaminated by fracking. Dr Jim Marshall, of Water UK, called on fracking firms to hold "upfront discussions" with water companies "before fracking becomes widespread in the UK". He said the water industry was not "taking sides" in the fracking debate, but wanted to ensure "corners are not cut and standards compromised, leaving us all counting the cost for years to come". Fracking - short for "hydraulic fracturing" - involves drilling deep underground and releasing a high-pressure mix of water, sand and chemicals to crack rocks and release gas stored inside. Water companies are worried the process could contaminate drinking water aquifers that lie above shale gas reserves. Water UK said this could happen by gases such as methane permeating into water sources from rocks where it was previously confined, chemicals getting in through cracks created by the fracking process, or by poor handling of waste water on the surface. A spokesman for Cuadrilla, which is carrying out test drilling in Lancashire, said: "There have been over two million hydraulic fracture treatments carried out globally, the majority in the US, and from that activity we are not aware of one single verified case of fracturing fluid contaminating aquifers." The spokesman said the firm, which also wants to drill at a site in West Sussex, was "committed to the highest standards of well integrity". He added that Cuadrilla was in "regular contact" with water suppliers and its supply of water "will never be prioritised over peoples' houses or farming". A joint report by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering published last year said the risks could be managed effectively through "strong regulation". Joseph Dutton, of Leicester University, told the BBC fracking presented "minimal danger" of water contamination if done properly, as the cracks it created were far deeper underground than aquifers. He said leaks in well casings near the surface, caused by "poor workmanship" or the tremors associated with fracking, were the most likely cause of contamination. Current EU and UK regulations "should ensure" no such incidents take place, Mr Dutton said - but he said the government "wants to speed up the process" and warned that loosening environmental controls, as happened in the US, would increase the risks. Mr Dutton said the amount of water used in fracking varies, but each well uses at least a million gallons. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said water companies "will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators". Speaking about the risk to water quality, a spokesman said there was "no evidence to date from the US of fracking causing groundwater contamination". He said the Environment Agency would regulate use of chemicals in the UK on a "site-by-site basis and would order fracking to stop if a risk to groundwater was identified. Widespread fracking has not started in the UK yet, but Cuadrilla began exploratory drilling in Lancashire in 2011 and many other possible sites have been identified. BBC industry correspondent John Moylan said he expected the creation of 40 to 50 fracking wells over the next two years. Large-scale fracking has reduced energy bills in the USA, but there is debate over whether the same would happen in the UK. Chancellor George Osborne, who earlier announced tax breaks to promote fracking, said it had the "potential to create thousands of jobs and keep energy bills low for millions of people." But Friends of the Earth said the government's "wild-eyed reverence for the new god of shale is completely misguided" and said there was "no evidence" it would reduce energy bills.	Drinking water could be contaminated with methane gas and chemicals due to fracking, water companies have warned.
